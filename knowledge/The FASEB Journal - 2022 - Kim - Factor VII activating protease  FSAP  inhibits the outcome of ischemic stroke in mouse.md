# Abstract  

The outcome of ischemic stroke can be improved by further refinements of thrombolysis and reperfusion strategies. Factor VII activating protease (FSAP) is a circulating serine protease that could be important in this context. Its levels are raised in  patients as well as mice after stroke and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  in the coding sequence, which results in an inactive enzyme, is linked to an increased risk of stroke. In vitro, FSAP cleaves fibrinogen to promote fi bri no lysis,  activates protease-­activated receptors, and decreases the cellular cyto toxicity of  histones. Based on these facts, we hypothesized that FSAP can be used as a treatment for ischemic stroke. A combination of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a  thr ombo ly tic drug, and recombinant serine protease domain of FSAP (FSAP-­SPD)  improved regional cerebral perfusion and neurological outcome and reduced infarct size in a mouse model of thr ombo embo li c stroke. FSAP-­SPD also improved  stroke outcomes and diminished the negative consequences of co-­treatment with  tPA in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke without altering cerebral perfusion. The inactive MI-­isoform of FSAP had no impact in either  model. FSAP enhanced the lysis of blood clots in vitro, but in the tail tr an section  model of hemostasis, FSAP-­SPD treatment provoked a faster clotting time indicating that it also has pro-­coagulant actions. Thus, apart from enhancing thrombolysis, FSAP has multiple effects on stroke progression and represents a promising  novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

# 1    |    INTRODUCTION  

An abrupt loss of brain blood supply due to arterial thrombosis is the major cause of ischemic stroke and it afflicts a  large number of people worldwide.  Along with the surgical removal of clots from larger arteries, the only approved  p harm a co logical therapy is tissue plasminogen activator  (tPA).  Thr ombo lysis with tPA is effective in the   $0–4.5\mathrm{~h~}$    time frame, after which the adverse effects outweigh the  positive attributes.  Moreover, it is efficacious in only  $30\%$    of the patients,  and its use is associated with hemorrhagic  transformation in about   $5\%{-}10\%$   of cases.  Th rom bec to my  is effective over a longer time range, it can be combined  with tPA and has a better cost-­benefit ratio.  Due to their  location and composition, some thrombi are irretrievable  by th rom bec to my and hence there is a need to improve the  thr ombo ly tic treatment of ischemic stroke. The pathology  of ischemic stroke involves a large number of molecular pathways and cellular interactions and the thrombo-­ inflammation nexus may provide alternative treatment  strategies.  

Factor VII activating protease (FSAP) is a circulating  serine protease, and individuals with the Marburg-­I (MI)  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which leads to a  protein with low pro teo ly tic activity,  have an increased  risk of stroke and carotid stenosis.  In one GWAS study,  a locus near this gene was found to increase the risk of  stroke in the young.  Circulating FSAP levels are increased in patients with ischemic stroke  and correlate  with poor collateral s and worse neurological outcome.   Mice have elevated levels of FSAP in the brain and plasma  after stroke 11  and FSAP-­deficient mice subjected to thromboembolic stroke exhibit a larger infarct volume and increased behavior deficit than wild type (WT) mice.  

Although the activation of FVII has been the name-­ giving property of this protein,  a number of other activities have been ascribed to it in relation to thrombosis  and hemostasis. It can activate pro-­urokinase (uPA),  and  decrease tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) activity 14   thereby promoting coagulation, cleave fibrinogen and  speed up the lysis of clots.  FSAP-­deficient mice exhibit  delayed thrombosis as well as hemostasis.  Reflecting the  opposing actions of FSAP on the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways, the MI-­SNP is not decisively linked to  thrombosis.  

FSAP has a broad substrate specificity 18  and among  others, it stimulates protease-­activated receptors (PARs)  and increases vascular permeability in the lungs,  as well  as inhibiting apoptosis.  FSAP is exceptionally effective  in blocking the toxicity of histones 21  and is more potent in  this activity than activated protein C (APC).  Histones  are released during necrosis, apoptosis, or during neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) 24  and are  potent activators of the zymogen form of FSAP.  Thus,  histones trigger a self-­destructing cycle that leads to their  own neutralization via FSAP. The interaction between  FSAP and NETs is further supported by the fact that FSAP  is co-­localized with  $\mathrm{NETs}^{22}$   in coronary artery thrombi.  

Thus, converging lines of evidence from human genetic  investigations, mouse models and in vitro studies   indicate that FSAP may be a candidate for the therapy of  ischemic stroke. To address these questions, we tested the  effects of recombinant serine protease domain (SPD) of  FSAP in ischemic stroke in mouse models.  

# 2    |    METHODS  

# 2.1    |    Mice  

Adult male C57BL6J mice (10–­15 weeks old) were obtained from Charles Rivers (Sulzfeld, Germany) and bred  in our institution under specific pathogen-­free (SPF) conditions. All animal experiments were approved by the  Norwegian food safety authority (Application Nos. 7557,  9769, and 9772). The group size was calculated for the effect of treatment on the infarct area  $24\,\mathrm{h}$   after stroke in WT  mice. We assumed a   $40\%$   difference in mean,   $30\%$   standard deviation,   $80\%$   power, and   $95\%$   confidence which gave  a group size of 7. We expected a premature termination of  the experiment in about   $20\%–25\%$   of the animals due to  premature death or abortive death due to excessive pain  or moribund state as stipulated by institutional guidelines.  To account for the differences in attrition rates between  the groups, we operated 8–­10 animals per group.  

# 2.2    |    Recombinant FSAP-­SPD  

The C-­terminal His-­tagged serine protease domain (SPD)  of human WT-­FSAP, hereafter referred to as WT-­SPD,  and the MI mutation (MI-­SPD) was prepared and characterized as described before.  

# 2.3    |    TES model  

Studies were performed in accordance with the “ARRIVE  Essential  $10^{\circ}$   guidelines 26  except that the operator was not  blinded to the treatments. Mice were randomly assigned to  different treatment groups (PBS, tPA, WT-­SPD plus tPA,  or MI-­SPD plus tPA). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and the core temperature was maintained at   $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$    with a rectal-­probe temperature-­controlled homeothermic blanket (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). Cerebral blood  flow (CBF) was measured by a laser Doppler flowmeter  (Moor, Axminster, UK) with a flexible fiber-­optic probe  affixed to the skull over the parietal cortex perfused by  the MCA after making an incision in the skin. The neck  area was dissected to expose the carotid artery and another fiber-­optic probe was attached under the carotid  artery bifurcation to measure arterial blood flow (ABF).  After exposing the carotid artery a   $1\!\times\!1\!\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   filter paper  soaked in   $20\%~\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}~(\mathrm{w/v})$   solution was placed on the  central section of the carotid artery for   $20\,\mathrm{min}$   to induce  thrombosis and stroke as described before.  Sixty minutes after the onset of thrombosis, the treatment with tPA 

 (Altepase, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany), 

  $(10\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$   body weight) and SPDs (  $[8\,\mathrm{mg/kg}/]$  body weight),  combinations of tPA and FSAP-­SPD, as well as, PBS was  initiated as an intravenous infusion over   $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$   (  $10\%$    bolus) through the dorsal penial vein. The neck and head  wound was sutured and the animals were transferred to  temperature-­controlled recovery cages, and at 4 and   $24\,\mathrm{h}$  ,  a 5-­point behavior score was determined.  Normal motor  function was scored as 0, flexion of the contra lateral torso  and forelimb on lifting the animal by the tail as 1, circling  to the contra lateral side but normal posture at rest as 2,  leaning to the contra lateral side at rest as 3, and no spontaneous motor activity as 4.  

# 2.4    |    tMCAO model  

Mice were randomly assigned to different treatment  groups; PBS, tPA, WT-­SPD plus tPA, MI-­SPD plus tPA,  WT-­SPD, or MI-­SPD. All procedures were the same as  in the TES model except that after the neck area was dissected to free the carotid artery, a filament (  $\phantom{-}0.22\!\sim\!0.24\,\mathrm{mm}$  ,  60-­2356 PK10, Doccol corporation, Sharon, MA) was inserted through an incision in the external carotid artery  and advanced through the internal carotid artery to the  origin of MCA as described before.  After confirming occlusion by a   $70\%$   drop in CBF, the filament was kept in  position for  $60\,\mathrm{{min}}$   while the mice were maintained under  anesthesia. After a   $15\,\mathrm{{min}}$   reperfusion period, the treatment was initiated and the rest of the procedures were as  described under the TES model.  

# 2.5    |    Analysis of hemorrhage, infarct  size, and hemisphere swelling  

Animals were sacrificed at the  $24\,\mathrm{h}$   time point, and the  brains were retrieved and cut into  $2\,\mathrm{mm}$   coronal sections  on a brain matrix and photographed to assess the extent  of hemorrhage. Foci of hemorrhage, with intense red  color in patches, were counted on one face of the brain  slices to provide a qualitative estimate of hemorrhagic  transformation. Infarct size was determined from sections stained with 2,3,5 tri phenyl tetra zo liu m chloride  (TTC)   $(2\%~\mathrm{w/v})$   in PBS at   $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$  . The areas of  both the hemispheres and the infarct area (white) were  measured using Photoshop and the infarct size was calculated across all sections. In order to reduce any bias  due to the selective representation of images, TTC staining was pseudo-­colored to combine all images from all  mice within a group using Image J. The swelling of   the infarcted hemisphere was determined by the formula: ([entire brain-­infarct hemisphere  $\times100.$  ]/infarct  hemisphere − contra lateral hemisphere).  

# 2.6    |    P harm a co kinetics  

Mice (  $~n=3$   mice) were given WT-­SPD at   $12\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$  body weight intravenously as a bolus and citrate-­ plasma   $(0.38\%~\mathrm{w/v}$   citrate) was collected at   $_{0-3\ \operatorname*{min}}$    or   $_{0-10\mathrm{~min}}$   in two independent experiments. Ac-­Pro-­ D Tyr-­Lys-­AMC (amino‐methyl‐coumarin) was used as  a sensitive and specific substrate for human FSAP as described before.  Hydrolysis of the flu orogenic substrate  was measured using a plate reader with excitation at   $320\,\mathrm{nm}$   and emission at   $460\,\mathrm{nm}$   (  $.37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $60\,\mathrm{{min}}$  ). The  maximal velocity was calculated from the linear part  of the progress curve. Western blotting and enzyme-­ linked immuno as say (ELISA) was used to determine  the concentration of FSAP-­SPD in mouse plasma.  The  antibody for Western blotting and ELISA was specific  for human FSAP with no or little cross-­reactivity with  mouse FSAP.  

# 2.7    |    Tail resection model of hemostasis  

The effect of WT-­SPD, MI-­SPD, Heparin, and PBS on hemostasis was tested. Isoflurane-­anesthetized mice (  $(n=5$    mice per group) were given different treatments i.v.  through the dorsal penile vein and  $15\,\mathrm{{min}}$   later  $0.5\;\mathrm{cm}$   tip  of the tail was resected before the tail was placed in PBS  at   $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The PBS solution was changed every 5 min for   $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$   and the time to stop bleeding was noted. The experiment was terminated after   $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$   by sacrificing the  animals. Hemoglobin concentration in the PBS solutions  was measured using the Hemoglobin Assay kit (Merck,  MAK115).  

# 2.8    |    Fibrinogen ELISA  

Citrate plasma was collected from mice from the TES  and tMCAO experiments at sacrifice. Mouse total  fibrinogen ELISA (#IMSFFBGKTT) from Innovative  Research (Novi, MI) was used to analyze the samples in  duplicates.  

# 2.9    |    In vitro clot lysis experiments  

Whole blood from C57BL6J mice (  ${\mathit{\Sigma}}_{n}=9$   mice) without  anticoagulant s was directly collected into a polyethylene  tube (PE-­50, I.D.   $0.58\,\mathrm{mm}$  ) and allowed to clot for   $^{\textrm{\scriptsize2h}}$   at  RT. Thereafter, the tubing was cut into 2 cm sections and  the clots ejected into wells of a microtiter plate with PBS  (triplicate wells per treatment). Clot lysis was initiated  with tPA   $(20\,\upmu\mathrm{g/mol})$   in  $10\%$   plasma from donor mice in the  absence or presence of WT-­SPD or MI-­SPD (  $(10\,\upmu\mathrm{g/ml})$   and  the liberation of erythrocytes/hemoglobin from the clots  was measured at  $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   at  $510\,\mathrm{nm}$   in a plate reader (Biotek).  Time to a maximal velocity of clot lysis and the end absorbance were quantified across different experiments.  

# 2.10    |    Effect of HMW-­HA on plasma  FSAP activity  

FSAP was purified from human plasma as described before.  FSAP activity was measured in buffer (  $.20\,\mathrm{mM}$   Tris,   $150\,\mathrm{mM}$   NaCl,   $1\%$   BSA   $\left(\mathrm{w/v}\right)$  ,   $\mathrm{pH}\ 7.5)$   by incubating purified FSAP at   $10\,\mathrm{\nM}$   with   $200\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   of substrate Ac-­Pro-­ DTyr-­Lys-­Arg-­AMC 32  in the presence of HMW-­HA and  LMW-­HA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For experiments involving the activation of pro-­FSAP in human  citrate plasma, plasma was first mixed with buffer (1:4)  and flu orogenic substrate. Histones   $(25\,\upmu\mathrm{g/ml})$   were then  added and fluorescence was recorded every 30 s for a further   $75\,\mathrm{{min}}$  . All experiments were performed in black,  flat-­bottom microtiter plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific,  Carlsbad, CA, USA) in an Infinite 200 fluorescence reader  (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) at   $360\,\mathrm{nm}$   excitation and   $450\,\mathrm{nm}$   emission wavelength, using the Magellan Software  package. From the raw data in relative fluorescence units  (RFU) the peak amount of FSAP and total FSAP generated were calculated. These experiments were repeated  independently thrice.  

# 2.11    |    Statistical analysis  

All data are expressed as mean  $\pm{\,\mathrm{SEM}}$  . Results from each  individual mouse are shown as a point in all panels. Data  were analyzed by one-­way analysis of variance (ANOVA)  with post hoc Bonferroni test for continuous measures;   $^{*}\!p\!<.05$   and   $^{**}\!p\!<\!.001\ ^{***}\!p\!<\!.0001$  . For categorical measures, we used the Kruskal–­Walis test with Mann–­Whitney  post-­test. SSPS statistical package was used for all analyses  (IBM, SPSS 26).  

# 3    |    RESULTS  

Before testing recombinant human WT-­SPD in stroke  models, we performed a pilot p harm a co kinetic study to  gain information about its half-­life in mice. WT-­SPD was  measured in plasma by Western blotting, human FSAP-­ specific ELISA as well as using a flu orogenic substrate  specific for the enzymatic activity of FSAP.  ELISA and  Western blotting indicated a shorter half-­life   $(2{-}3\,\mathrm{\min})$    compared to the activity-­based assay   $(4{-}5\ \mathrm{min})$   in mice  (Figure  S1A–­D ). The rapid formation of high MW complexes with inhibitors (Figure  S1A ) most likely accounts  for its short half-­life. Based on these results we elected a  30-­min infusion protocol for the application of WT-­SPD so  that its levels remained elevated for at least   $35\,\mathrm{{min}}$   during  the treatment.  

We first used a model of thr ombo embo li c stroke (TES)  where thrombosis was induced in the carotid artery with a  topical application of   $\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$  , which causes oxidative damage to the vessel wall.  A primary thrombus blocks the  carotid artery while micro thro mbi embolize to the brain  micro vas cula ture,  representing a model of large vessel  TES. WT-­SPD was infused together with tPA, the standard  thr ombo ly tic treatment, and compared to tPA alone and  PBS,   $60\,\mathrm{{min}}$   after the onset of thrombosis in the carotid  artery ( Figure   1A ). Since FSAP alone did not exhibit any  fi bri no ly tic activity,  WT-­SPD was not tested on its own  in this experiment. In pilot studies, we observed a superior  effect of 8.0, compared to 2.0, mg/kg body weight of WT-­ SPD and thus the higher concentration was used throughout the study. This is similar to the mode of delivery and  dose of tPA used in such experiments.  In all experiments,  we also tested the enzymatic ally inactive MI-­SPD,  which  differs by a single amino acid, as a control.  

Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to track the consequences of thrombosis and the subsequent fi bri no lysis on  cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the middle cerebral artery 

 (MCA) territory as well as the carotid artery blood flow 

 (ABF) downstream of the thrombus. The validity of this  experimental design was first tested by temporarily ligating the carotid artery with a suture. This reduced CBF,  whereas compensatory mechanisms increased ABF via  collateral circulation as described before 36  (Figure   S2 ).  Thrombosis in the carotid artery reduced CBF, whereas  ABF first increased transient ly before decreasing  ( Figure   1B ). tPA treatment in all combinations elevated  ABF ( Figure   1B–­E ), but this was not statistically significant ( Figure   1F ). CBF was not influenced by treatment  with tPA or tPA plus MI-­SPD ( Figure    1B–­E ), but only

significantly with tPA plus WT-­SPD ( Figure   1G ). We then  assessed the size of the primary clot in the carotid artery.  The size of the occluding clot was reduced in all groups  with tPA treatment, confirming arterial thr ombo lysis, but  the additional presence of either isoform of SPD did not  influence the residual clot size significantly ( Figure   1H,I ). After   $24\mathrm{h}$  , similar infarct size, involving much of the  dorsal and ventral striatum with overlying cortical areas,  

was observed in animal groups treated with PBS, tPA, and  tPA with MI-­SPD, while infarct size in mice treated with tPA  plus WT-­SPD was strikingly smaller ( Figure   2A ). Behavioral  scoring showed that mice treated with tPA performed worse  after  $24\mathrm{h}$  , compared to the PBS, highlighting the adverse effects of tPA that are also observed in patients.  These scores  were better in mice treated with tPA plus WT-­SPD compared  to tPA plus MI-­SPD ( Figure    2B ). There were no, edema-­ related, changes in hemisphere volumes ( Figure   2C ). The  mortality was  $2/9$   in PBS, 3/10 in tPA, 3/10 in tPA plus MI-­ SPD, and  $1/8$   in tPA plus WT-­SPD group.  

Based on the known effects of FSAP on promoting fibrinolysis in human plasma,  we postulated that better  clot lysis could account for the above results and therefore  studied the lysis of mouse whole-­blood clots in vitro. We  found that the overall dissolution of clots with tPA plus  WT-­SPD was significantly better compared to using tPA  alone or tPA plus MI-­SPD (Figure  S3A,B ). The time to a  maximal velocity of clot lysis was also shorter in the presence of WT-­SPD and tPA (Figure  S3C,D ). WT-­ or MI-­SPD  alone, had no direct effect on clot lysis as reported earlier  with human plasma-­FSAP in human plasma clots.  Thus,  better clot lysis with WT-­SPD and tPA could account for  the improved CBF in the TES model.  

Considering the number of opposing actions FSAP  has with respect to coagulation and fi bri no lysis,  we  examined the effects of WT-­SPD on hemostasis in a tail-­ tr an section model ( Figure    3A ). WT-­SPD decreased the  bleeding time ( Figure   3B ) and the amount of blood loss  ( Figure   3C ) compared to MI-­SPD or PBS treatment, which  is in agreement with our earlier results.  Mice treated with  heparin bled during the entire experiment ( Figure   3B,C ).  Since FSAP cleaves fibrinogen and promotes fi bri no lysis,  we also assessed the effect of the different treatments in the

TES model on circulating levels of fibrinogen. Fibrinogen  levels were reduced in the tPA-­treatment group compared  to mice given PBS, but this reduction was not affected by  the co-­administration of WT-­SPD ( Figure   3D ).  

We then tested the FSAP-­SPD in the tMCAO model of  stroke which features ischemia–­reperfusion injury and  micro vascular obstruction, rather than overt large vessel  thrombosis.  Treatments were initiated  $75\,\mathrm{{min}}$   after the  onset of ischemia ( Figure   4A ). CBF remained depressed  in the reperfusion phase in all groups (Figure   S4A,B ),  most likely due to non-­thrombotic obstruction of the  micro vessels. No differences in plasma-­fibrinogen were  observed (Figure  S4C ) indicating a lack of involvement  of overt coagulation/fi bri no lysis in this model.  

After   $24\,\mathrm{h}$  , all stroke parameters were significantly improved in the WT-­SPD plus tPA groups, compared to the  other groups. The number of hemorrhagic foci was increased in tPA-­treated mice, while only to a lesser extent  in mice also receiving WT-­SPD. For unknown reasons, the  number of foci was significantly elevated in the MI-­SPD

group ( Figure    4B,C ). The infarct size was also larger in  groups treated with tPA, MI-­SPD, or their combination  while being significantly smaller in mice that received WT-­ SPD alone or together with tPA ( Figure   4D,E ). WT-­SPD plus  tPA treatment decreased the edema-­related expansion of  the stroke hemisphere ( Figure   4F ) and improved the behavior score ( Figure   4G ). The mortality was   $2/9$   in PBS,   $2/9$   in  tPA,   $2/9$   in tPA plus MI-­SPD,  $2/9$   in tPA plus WT-­SPD, 3/10  in MI-­SPD, and 1/8 in the WT-­SPD group ( Figure   4A–­G ).  Hence, in a stroke model with lesser involvement of coagulation, FSAP-­SPD had a beneficial effect on its own as well  as reduced the deleterious effects of tPA.  

During the completion of this study, it was reported  that inhibition of FSAP improves stroke outcomes in the  tMCAO model.  FSAP was inhibited with HMW-­HA based  on an earlier report that it inhibits FSAP activity in vitro.   To resolve this apparent contradiction to our conclusions  with recombinant FSAP-­SPD, we investigated the inhibition of FSAP with HMW-­HA in more detail. HMW-­HA, and  for comparison LMW-­HA, did not in any way modulate the  activity of purified full-­length FSAP (Figure  S5A ). FSAP in  plasma is in a zymogen form with no activity and can be  activated with histones.  Using a very selective and sensitive assay to detect FSAP activity in plasma we found no  effect of HMW-­HA and LMW-­HA on the histone-­mediated  increase in the activity of FSAP (Figure  S5B ). Therefore,  HMW-­HA does not inhibit the enzymatic activity of FSAP.  

# 4    |    DISCUSSION  

A p harm a co logical treatment for ischemic stroke that can  promote the actions of tPA, as well as block its negative effects, will improve the management of ischemic stroke patients considerably.  This study is the first reported use of  recombinant FSAP-­SPD as a therapeutic agent in ischemic  stroke in mice in combination with tPA and demonstrates  improvement in stroke outcome in two mouse models. In  the TES model, tPA plus FSAP-­SPD improved cerebral blood  flow, decreased infarct size, and reversed tPA-­mediated  motor impairment. In the tMCAO model, FSAP-­SPD decreased infarct size, and reversed tPA-­mediated motor impairment, hemorrhage as well as edema without influencing  cerebral blood flow. On its own, FSAP-­SPD reduced infarct  size but did not significantly affect other outcomes. These  results are congruent with earlier observations in relation  to FSAP gene-­polymorphisms and stroke,  and changes in  plasma levels of FSAP in human stroke patients.  An advantage of using FSAP is that it promotes fi bri no lysis without altering tPA or plasmin activity since it directly cleaves  fibrin/ogen rendering clots more susceptible to fi bri no lysis.   This avoids the typical problems of pro-­thr ombo ly tic drugs  related to increased hemorrhage and/or bleeding associated  with increased tPA and/or plasmin activity.  In line with  this hypothesis, we expected FSAP-­SPD treatment to influence plasma fibrinogen levels. There was a tPA-­related decrease in plasma fibrinogen in the TES model, but not in the  tMCAO model, indicating consumption of fibrinogen, but  FSAP-­SPD did not influence this further. This needs to be  investigated in detailed time course studies in the future.  

The TES model mimics the often encountered clinical  situation where tPA re can aliz es the primary blocked artery, but fails to establish distal cerebral reperfusion.  The  likely reasons for this resistance to thr ombo lysis are vascular dysfunction, cellular aggregation, bio mechanical factors, ischemia–­reperfusion injury, and clot composition.   Apart from fibrinogen, other components such as the von  Willebrand factor, NETs and DNA may contribute significantly to clot stability.  FSAP-­SPD promotes fi bri no lysis  by cleavage of the  $\upalpha\cdot$  -­ and   $\upbeta$  -­chain of fibrinogen,  but it may  also influence pro teo lysis of some of the other factors. The  observed pattern of blood flow in the brain and carotid artery confirmed the successful use of FSAP-­SPD and tPA to  re-­establish cerebral blood flow in the brain and was confirmed by the in vitro clot lysis experiments. Cerebral blood  flow is indirectly related to the thrombus load in the brain,  but the latter was not quantified in the current study.  

Application of FSAP-­SPD in vivo leads to the formation  of FSAP inhibitor complexes, amongst others, with plasminogen activator inhibitor $\cdot1^{42}$   and alpha2-­anti plasm in.   Hence, the faster lysis of clots in the presence of FSAP-­ SPD seen in our experiments could also be due to the scavenging of these inhibitors of fi bri no lysis. Cellular uptake  of FSAP-­SPD-­inhibitor complexes probably accounts for  its short half-­life in vivo similar to that for tPA.  This  necessitated the use of relatively high concentrations of  FSAP-­SPD   $(200~\upmu\mathrm{g}/25\,\mathrm{g}$   mouse). Although this is similar  to the concentration of tPA used in mouse experiments, it  exceeds the normal circulating levels of FSAP   $(12\,\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{mol})$  .  

We studied the effects of FSAP-­SPD on hemostasis because of the known effects of FSAP on coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways. FSAP-­SPD shorted bleeding time in the tail  tr an section model, as observed in a previous study with full-­ length FSAP in FSAP-­deficient mice.  This pro-­coagulant  effect is most likely due to the in activation of TFPI α .  In  mice, the main source of TFPI α  that is responsible for its hemostatic effects are platelets 45  but we did not investigate this  point further in the current study. The seemingly incongruent actions seen with the pro-­hemostatic effect and, at the  same time, improved stroke outcome, can be reconciled with  the hypothesis that in the stroke model the pro-­fi bri no ly tic  effect of FSAP predominates over the pro-­hemostatic effect,  leading to an overall positive outcome. Counter intuitively,  the pro-­hemostatic effect might negate the hemorrhagic  transformation due to tPA. Through detailed structure–­ function studies it may be possible to mutate away the  pro-­coagulant effects in FSAP, as has been successfully done  with other coagulation factors such as APC.  

The positive outcome of FSAP treatment in the tMCAO  model, which is largely devoid of thrombosis, indicates that  FSAP is likely to have additional mechanisms of action independent ly of its effects on coagulation and fi bri no lysis.  A number of FSAP substrates have been identified in-­vitro  that are relevant in stroke. Extracellular histones are released  during necrosis, apoptosis or during NETosis 24  are found in  stroke-­thrombi.  They are key mediators in stroke either  through their cytotoxic effects or through toll-­like receptors.   FSAP is a potent neutralizing factor of histones through their  pro teo ly tic cleavage 21-­23  and this could improve stroke outcome. For instance, reversal of the histone-­mediated increase  in endo the li al permeability 49  by FSAP-­SPD could reduce  edema, as observed in FSAP-­SPD-­treated mice.  

Activation of PARs is another mechanism relevant for  stroke. APC cleaves PARs at non-­canonical sites and generates cellular responses that improve stroke outcome,   In contrast, FSAP cleaves PARs at their canonical cleavage  sites,  so the signaling initiated by FSAP will be different  from that by APC. In lung cancer cells the activation of PAR-­1  by FSAP inhibits apopotosis 20  but, it remains to be tested if  this is also the case for neuro vascular cells. FSAP also regulates endo the li al permeability in the lungs via   $\mathrm{{PAR}s^{19}}$   and  this mechanism may also operate in brain endothelium in  the context of stroke. The different properties of FSAP that  are relevant for stroke are summarized in  Figure   5 .  

In a recent study, it was reported that inhibition of  FSAP improves stroke outcome in the tMCAO model 11   which is the opposite of our conclusion. HMW-­HA, an  acidic polymer of hyaluronic acid that is usually found in  the extracellular matrix, was used to inhibit FSAP in these  experiments. HMW-­HA has pleiotropic effects on many  cell types and causes extensive changes in the gene expression profiles of cells via various cell surface receptors  including CD44, LYVE-­1, RHAMM, and TLR4.  In view  of these very broad actions of HMW-­HA, it is not possible  to ascribe its effect on stroke to a single molecular interaction with FSAP. Furthermore, we did not observe any  inhibitory effect of HMW-­HA on FSAP activity. Thus, the  effects of HMW-­HA treatment on stroke outcomes are unlikely to be related to its ability to inhibit FSAP.  

Limitations of this, proof-­of-­concept, study is that the experiments were not carried out in aged mice or female mice,  or mice with co-­morbid i ties, which are important factors in  determining drug efficacy in stroke treatment as described  in the STAIRS guidelines.  The hemorrhagic transformation related to tPA treatment becomes more prominent with  the passage of time and we did not test the effect of FSAP in  a delayed treatment setting. Furthermore, long-­term studies with extensive sensory-­motor tests are needed to judge  the overall translational relevance of these results. Blinding

FIGURE 5   Schematic representation of the effects of FSAP-­ SPD on thr ombo embo li c stroke: Primary brain damage caused  by stroke is exasperated by the release of mediators, e.g., histones  that cause secondary damage (gray boxes and lines). tPA mediates  lysis of the primary thrombus but re-­establishment of the distal  perfusion is not always successful and rates of hemorrhagic events  are high (blue boxes and lines). FSAP-­SPD enables better distal  perfusion as well as reverses some of the negative effects of tPA  treatment (red lines). The effects of FSAP-­SPD which contribute  to a better stroke outcome are numbered (1–­5) in the figure. (1)  Fibrin(ogen) cleavage and improved fi bri no lysis,  (2) histone  cleavage to reduce its cyto toxicity,  (3) activation of PARs   to mediate favorable regulation of endo the li al permeability, (4)  scavenging of serine protease inhibitors  to promote the activity  of plasmin, and (5) pro-­coagulant effect, through in activation of  TFPI  which may negate the hemorrhagic tendency. The latter  four properties of FSAP-­SPD will also operate in occlusive models  of stroke in the absence of a thrombus.  

was not used during treatments, due to practical reasons,  and this may have influenced the outcome of the study.  Although the group size was judged appropriately during  the design of the stroke experiments, 7 animals per group  constitute a small group size. A disadvantage of using the  serine protease domain of FSAP, and not the full-­length protein, is that the full complement of regulatory interactions is  lost with the use of the SPD domain thus limiting the extrapolation of these results to a physiological context. However,  we confirmed that SPD recapitulates all, the tested, activities of the endogenous full-­length protein.  The use of  recombinant human protein in the mouse may lead to aberrant conclusions that need to be replicated using recombinant mouse FSAP. However, the same expression system,  used for producing human FSAP-­SPD, was not suitable for  mouse FSAP-­SPD expression. One possible solution to the  problems of expressing recombinant FSAP is to identify a  selective and potent activator of the endogenous pro-­FSAP  zymogen, as we have done using phage display,  which  then may achieve the same end-­effect.  

In our studies, FSAP-­SPD showed promising results  in a p harm a co logical context by significantly improving  stroke outcomes in mice. FSAP has the advantage of being  an endogenous blood protein with a plausible mechanism  of action that is readily amenable to further development.
