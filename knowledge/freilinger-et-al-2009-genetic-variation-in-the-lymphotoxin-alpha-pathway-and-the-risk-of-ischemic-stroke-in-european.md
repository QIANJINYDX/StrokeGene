Background and Purpose —Several genes involved in the lymph o toxin  $\cdot\alpha$   cascade ( LTA ,  LGALS2 , and  PSMA6 ) have been linked with the risk of myocardial infarction. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of these genes in patients with ischemic stroke (IS). Methods —Twenty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from  LTA ,  LGALS2 , and  PSMA6  were genotyped in 601 German IS patients and 736 matched controls. SNPs and haplotypes were tested for association with overall IS, large vessel stroke, and card i oem boli c stroke. Significant associations were replicated in an independent sample of 843 IS cases and 933 controls from the UK. Results —Only one SNP (rs1048990 in  PSMA6 ) showed association with overall IS, but this was not replicated in the UK sample. Three SNPs showed significant associations with stroke subtypes   $(P{<}0.05)$  ), but none of these associations could be replicated in the UK population. Conclusions —Genetic variation in the lymph o toxin $^{,}\alpha$   cascade ( LTA ,  LGALS2 , and  PSMA6 ) is not a major risk factor  

for IS.  ( Stroke . 2009;40:970-972.)

I nfl amma tory pathways are important in the development of atherosclerosis. 1,2   Recent work has implicated the inflammatory lymph o toxin $^{\cdot\alpha}$   cascade in the pathogen es is of myocardial infarction (MI): in a series of studies including a whole-genome association study and functional experiments, Ozaki and colleagues showed that variation in the genes for lymph o toxin  $\cdot\alpha$   ( LTA ), galectin-2 ( LGALS2 ), and proteasome subunit    $\alpha$   type 6 ( PSMA6 ) is associated with MI in the Japanese population, 3–5   although these results were not consistently replicated.  

MI and IS, particularly stroke attributable to large artery at hero sclerotic disease, share common risk factors and mechanisms. However, aside from a small study on  LTA , 11   the role of the lymph o toxin $\cdot\alpha$   cascade in IS remains unexplored. We therefore set out to perform a comprehensive analysis of  $L T A$  ,  $L G A L S2$  , and  $P S M A6$   in a large German case–control sample with IS and an independent replication sample from the UK.  

# Subjects and Methods  

601 European Caucasian patients (mean age 64 years, 377 men) with IS were recruited from a single dedicated stroke unit in Munich, Germany. 12   IS was categorized using the TOAST classification system 13   (large vessel:  $\mathrm{n\!=\!186}$  ; cardiac embolism:   $\mathrm{n\!=\!143}$  ; small vessel:   $\mathrm{n\!=\!86}$  ; other determined etiology:   $\mathrm{n}\!=\!45$  ; undetermined:  $\mathrm{n\!=\!141}$  ). Controls were recruited from the KORA study 14   and comprised 736 unrelated age- and sex-matched individuals (mean age 62 years,  $447~\mathrm{men}$  ) without prior stroke or TIA.  

SNPs were selected with the tagger algorithm based on data of the International HapMap Project. All  PSMA6  and  LGALS2  SNPs from the initial Ozaki et al 3,5   studies were included; for rs909253 from LTA , 4   neighboring SNPs were used as surrogate markers because of almost complete LD observed in previous studies 9   (for details on SNP selection cf. supplemental Table I, available online at http:// stroke.aha journals.org). Genotyping was performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. Because of the reported role of the LTA pathway in atherosclerosis and MI, SNPs were tested for correlation with overall IS, large vessel stroke (LVS), and card i oem boli c stroke (69 comparisons) using Chi-Sq-Tests (allelic model). The following software was used: WG-Permer Version 0.9.9, R Version 2.6.1 and UNPHASED Version 3.0.12. To correct for multiple testing, the Westfall and Young permutation method was applied. 15   Haplotype analyses were performed with a sliding window approach (2, 3, and 4 markers).  

SNPs with nominally significant associations were replicated in an independent sample from the UK which included 843 consecutive Caucasian IS patients (mean age 66.71 years, 491 men). All patients had brain imaging with CT or MRI and imaging of the carotid arteries with duplex or MRA. Echo car dio graph y was performed when clinically indicated. IS was categorized as described above (large vessel:  $\mathrm{n}\!=\!242$  ;

For SNP No. 18 (rs2009658; cf. supplemental Table I), analysis failed because of a call-rate of only  $93\%$  .  

cardiac embolism:   $\mathrm{n}\!=\!133$  ; small vessel:   $\mathrm{n}\!=\!153$  ; other determined etiology:  $\mathrm{n}{=}5$  ; more then one cause:  $\mathrm{n{=}86}$  ; undetermined:  $\mathrm{n}\!=\!224$  ). 933 white Caucasian community controls, age- and sex-matched (mean age 65.16 years,  $538\,\mathrm{\mum}$  ), free of symptomatic cerebro vascular disease were recruited by random sampling of family doctor lists. The study was approved by the local ethics committees.  

# Results  

There were no deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for any of the markers and study groups investigated. All markers were genotyped with a high call rate (average  $97\%$  ); for rs2009658 analysis failed (call-rate of only  $93\%$  ). Power calculations are presented in supplemental Table III.  

# All Ischemic Stroke  

Only one SNP was associated with risk of IS as a whole; the minor allele of a single SNP from  PSMA6  (rs1048990) was associated with a decreased risk of overall IS (Table 1; OR 0.795,  $95\%$   CI 0.640 to 0.987,  $P{=}0.037$   un corrected,  $\scriptstyle P=0.477$  corrected). This association could not be replicated in the UK population (OR 1.079,   $95\%$   CI 0.895 to 1.300,    $\scriptstyle P=0.424$  un corrected).  

# Ischemic Stroke Subtypes  

In subgroup analyses, the minor allele of rs1048990 was also associated with a decreased risk of LVS (supplemental Table II). This association was not replicated in the UK population.  

In addition in the German population, the minor alleles of two LTA  SNPs showed associations with an increased risk of LVS (rs2844484) and card i oem boli c stroke (rs1800629) (supplemental Table II). Analysis of haplotypes constructed of a subset of SNPs did not increase the significance above the level observed with single-marker tests (data not shown). None of the single

marker associations could be replicated in the UK sample (Table 2). Genotypic ORs are presented in supplemental Table IV.  

# Discussion  

This study suggests that genetic variation in  LTA ,  LGALS2 , and  PSMA6  plays no major role in the pathogen et is of IS. No replicable association was found with overall IS or IS subtypes.  

Strengths of our study include (1) adequate statistical power, (2) comprehensive analysis of all three genes (tagSNP approach) in a large, carefully phenotyped sample and an independent replication sample, and (3) rigorous correction for multiple testing.  

A limitation is the lack of control for vascular risk factors, which was impossible because of limited information in several German patients.  

A previous study in a Hungarian population found significant associations between two SNPs (rs1041981 and rs909253) in  LTA  and risk of LVS. 11   However, the sample was small (353 patients and 180 controls), and no replication was performed. rs1041981 showed no association with stroke in the current study. Taken together, these studies provide no convincing evidence for a role of the  LTA  gene in IS. They illustrate the need for immediate replication in stroke genetic studies.
