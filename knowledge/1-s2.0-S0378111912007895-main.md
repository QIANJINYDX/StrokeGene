An association between ph os ph odi est erase 4D (PDE4D) gene and risk of stroke has been suggested by deCODE group in an Icelandic population. In the present case – control study we investigated the association of SNP41 (rs12153798) and SNP56 (rs702553) with ischemic stroke and stroke subtypes. Five hundred and sixteen ischemic stroke patients and 513 healthy age and sex matched controls were included in the study. The genotypes were determined by subjecting the PCR products to sequencing. Both the SNPs 56 and 41 associated signi ﬁ cantly with stroke [adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.97$  ;   $95\%$   CI (1.262 – 3.082);    $p\!=\!0.003$  : adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!5.42$  ;   $95\%$   CI (3.45 – 8.5);  $p{<}0.001$   respectively]. In addition to this, a novel SNP at position   $59736747\,\mathrm{T}\!\!>\!\!\mathsf{G}$   was found while sequencing the PCR products including SNP56. This novel SNP was found in patients as well as controls but did not show a signi ﬁ cant association with the disease. We found signi ﬁ cant association of SNPs 56 and 41 with large artery atherosclerosis, lacunar and card i oem boli c stroke. In conclusion PDE4D gene plays a key part in the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke in the South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh.

constructed by SNP45 and this satellite marker were reported to show the most signi ﬁ cant association with stroke. A recent meta-analysis carried out by  Yoon et al. (2011)  including 6 SNPs (SNP26, SNP45, SNP56, SNP83, SNP87 and SNP89) showed the most signi ﬁ cant association of SNP56 (rs702553) with ischemic stroke ( Yoon et al., 2011 ). We have already tested the association of SNPs 83, 32 and 87 with ischemic stroke in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh ( Munshi et al., 2009 ). A study from North India also found an association of SNP83 and SNP87 with ischemic stroke and extra cranial large artery atherosclerosis respectively ( Kalita et al., 2011 ). The present study was carried out with an aim to evaluate the association of SNP41 and SNP56 with ischemic stroke and its subtypes in the same population.  

# 1. Introduction  

Variants in the ph os ph odi est erase 4D (PDE4D) gene have been associated with stroke through whole-genome linkage screen in Icelandic population by deCODE group ( Greta rs do ttir et al., 2003 ). Number of subsequent studies tried to replicate this association in different populations but the results were con ﬂ icting ( Munshi and Kaul, 2008; Yoon et al., 2011 ). PDE4D gene encodes for an enzyme that selectively degrades cAMP. It seems to be a potential candidate gene for stroke because its enzyme activity regulates the response of human tissues to injury and infections ( Conti et al., 2003; Hakonarson, 2006 ).  

PDE4D is a large gene spanning  $>\!1.5\mathrm{mb}$   on chromosomal region 5q12. It has 22 exons, 8 splice variants and several hundred SNPs ( Greta rs do ttir et al., 2003 ).  Greta rs do ttir et al. (2003)  found that PDE4D gene is highly associated with combination of car dio geni c and carotid stroke ( Greta rs do ttir et al., 2003 ). SNP41 (rs12153798), SNP45 (rs12188950), one micro satellite marker (AC008818-8) and the haplotypes

# 2.1. Subjects  

Five hundred and sixteen ischemic stroke patients (males:females  $=$  360:156), presenting with new stroke evaluated in the stroke clinic of Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad (A.P, India) were included in the study. The study was approved by ethical committee of the study hospital. All the patients were examined by a quali ﬁ ed stroke neurologist and ischemic stroke was differentiated by computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All the patients underwent CT scan as well as MRI. Patients with major cardiac, renal, hepatic, endo cri no logical disorders, skeletal disorders and cancers were excluded from this study. The ischemic stroke was classi ﬁ ed into subtypes according to the TOAST classi ﬁ cation ( Adams et al., 1993 ).  

As a control group 513 healthy individuals matched for sex and age (males:females  $=356{:}157$  ) were recruited from the same demographic area. The controls were blood donors from the study hospital and staff members of the Institute of Genetics and Hospital for Genetic Diseases. The controls had no clinical evidence of any cerebro vascular disease. Information on demographic features and risk factors was collected by using a structural questionnaire. Hypertension, alcohol use, diabetes and smoking were de ﬁ ned as reported previously ( Munshi et al., 2008 ).  

# 2.2. DNA isolation and genotyping  

Five milliliters of blood was collected in EDTA tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using standard phenol-chloroform method. The genotypes were determined by amplifying the region bearing the polymorphism (SNP41 and SNP56) by PCR and subjecting the PCR products to sequencing ( Figs. 1 and 2 ).  

2.3. Statistical analysis  

Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium was tested for PDE4D gene polymorphisms. Association between genotypes and stroke was examined by odds ratio (OR) with  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval (CI) and Chi-square analysis using Open EPI6 software (Open Epi Version 2.3.1 from Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA). Allelic frequencies were calculated according to the number of different alleles observed and the total number of alleles was examined. Multiple logistic regression analysis with forward

stepwise selection (Wald) was performed using S PSS 18 software. The independent variables were decoded as the following dummy variables: genotype, 0 for normal homozygotes and 1 for heterozygotes and 2 for mutant homozygotes; sex, 1 for male and 2 for female; smoking, 1 for smokers and 2 for non-smokers; hypertension, 1 for hypertension and 2 for norm o tension; and for diabetes mellitus, 1 for presence and 2 for absence. Statistical signi ﬁ cance was de ﬁ ned as  $p{<}0.05$  .  

# 3. Results  

Five hundred and sixteen ischemic stroke patients and 513 age and sex matched healthy controls were included in this study. The clinical characteristics of the patients and controls have been presented in  Table 1 . All the subjects belonged to South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh. Mean age was 49.3 years in the former group and 49.01 years in the later. Stroke patients also had signi ﬁ cantly

Age, systolic BP, diastolic BP, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, random glucose and triglycerides are given as mean (SD). Stroke patients have signi ﬁ cantly higher levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher serum triglycerides and random glucose and a lower level of HDL   $(p{<}0.001$  ).  $p$   Values were calculated using students' paired  t -test (SPSS 18).

higher levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher serum triglycerides and random glucose and a lower level of HDL (  $\cdot_{p<0.001})$  ).  

The genotypic distribution of SNP41 and frequency of C and T alleles in patients and controls has been given in  Table 2 . There was statistically signi ﬁ cant difference in the genotypic distribution between patients and controls [for TT vs. CC,  $\chi^{2}\!=\!11.07$  ;  $p{<}0.001$  ; odds ratio  $=$  1.85 (  $95\%$   CI; 1.28 – 2.67)]; for TT vs.   $\mathsf{C T}+\mathsf{C C},$     $[\chi^{2}\!=\!7.128$  ;  $p\!=\!0.003$  , odds ratio  $=\!1.58$   (  $95\%$   CI; 1.128 – 2.215)] ( Table 2 ). Signi ﬁ cant difference was observed in the frequency of T and C alleles in patients and controls  $[\chi^{2}\!=\!13.13$  ;  $p{<}0.001$  , odds ratio  $=1.39$   (  $95\%$   CI; 1.164 – 1.664)] ( Table 2 ). We performed multiple logistic regression analysis with forward stepwise selection using all other risk factors and TT genotype. It revealed that the most predictive independent risk factors for ischemic stroke were TT genotype [adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.97$  ;  $95\%$   CI (1.262 – 3.082);  $p\!=\!0.003]$  ], diabetes, smoking, alcoholism and hypertension   $(p{<}0.001)$  ).  

The genotypic distribution of SNP56 and frequency of A and T alleles in patients and controls have been given in  Table 3 . There was statistically signi ﬁ cant difference in the genotypic distribution between patients and controls [for TT vs. AA,  $\chi^{2}\!=\!46.02$  ;  $p\!=\!<\!0.001$  , odds ratio  $=$  3.49 (  $95\%$   CI; 2.414 – 5.053); For TT  vs .   $\mathsf{A A}\,\!+\!\,\mathsf{A T}$  ,    $\chi^{2}\!=\!29.83$  ;  $p\!=\!0.001$  , odds ratio  $=\!2.51$   (  $95\%$   CI; 1.793 – 3.52)] ( Table 3 ). Signi ﬁ cant difference was observed in the allele frequency of T and A alleles in patients and controls   $[\chi^{2}\!=\!53.6$  ;    $p\!=\!<\!0.001$  , odds ratio  $=1.94$   (  $95\%$   CI; 1.628 – 2.33)] ( Table 3 ). The results were con ﬁ rmed by multiple logistic regression analysis [adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!5.42$  ;  $95\%$  CI (3.45 – 8.5);  $p{<}0.001$  ]. We also evaluated interaction between these two SNPs to  ﬁ nd out association of any speci ﬁ c haplotypes with stroke risk. The studied population was strati ﬁ ed according to the number of high risk variants of SNP56&41 concomitantly carried by a given individual and compared with the group having no risk genotypes. However, none of the haplotypes associated signi ﬁ cantly with the disease. In addition to this we did not  ﬁ nd statistical signi ﬁ cant difference in males vs. females as far as the association of genotypic frequencies is concerned.  

Examining the association of SNP41 and SNP56 with stroke subtypes classi ﬁ ed according to TOAST classi ﬁ cation we found signi ﬁ cant association of both of these SNPs with large artery atherosclerosis, lacunar and card i oem boli c stroke (  $\cdot_{p<0.001}$  ) ( Tables 4 and 5 ). SNP56 also associated with stroke of determined and stroke of undetermined etiology.  

While sequencing the PCR products including SNP56, we found a novel SNP at position   $59736747\,\mathrm{T}{>}\,\mathsf{G}$   ( Fig. 3 ). It was found in controls as well as the patients. The genotypic distribution of this polymorphism and frequency of T and G alleles have been given in  Table 6 . Evaluating

# 4. Discussion  

After  Greta rs do ttir et al. (2003)  identi ﬁ ed PDE4D as a susceptible gene for stroke, more than a dozen follow-up studies have been taken up to study the single nucleotide polymorphisms across this gene for association with the disease ( Greta rs do ttir et al., 2003 ). Cohorts of different ethnicities have been studied. A detailed account of all these follow-up studies has already been reviewed ( Munshi and Kaul, 2008; Yoon et al., 2011 ). In ﬂ ammation has emerged as a key factor in the development of at hero sclerotic lesions and in the progression to mature atheroma ( Quarta et al., 2009 ). Further, in ﬂ ammatory activation promotes thrombosis which is the most dreadful complication of atherosclerosis. This can result in stroke and/or myocardial infarction ( Libby, 2002 ). PDE4D protein has been hypothesized to be involved in stroke risk through this at hero sclerotic pathway ( Greta rs do ttir et al., 2003 ). PDE4D selectively degrades the second messenger cAMP a key signaling molecule mediating proliferation, migration and secretion of cells related to atherosclerosis ( Houslay and Adams, 2003; Ichiki, 2006; Lorenowicz et al., 2007 ).  

In the present study we evaluated the association of two SNPs 56 (rs702553) and 41 (rs12153798) with ischemic stroke and its sub types in a South Indian Population from Andhra Pradesh. To the best of our knowledge this is the  ﬁ rst study reporting an association between SNPs 56 and 41 with ischemic stroke in an Indian population. In the present study we found a signi ﬁ cant association of SNP56 with ischemic stroke which is in accordance with previous studies ( Lin et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2006; Zee et al., 2006 ). A stepwise multiple logistic regres- sion analysis con ﬁ rmed these  ﬁ ndings. However, other studies failed to establish an association ( Brophy et al., 2006; Ku hlen baumer et al., 2006; Matsushita et al., 2009; Staton et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2009 ). A re- cent meta-analysis by Yoon et al. found the most signi ﬁ cant association of SNP56 with ischemic stroke ( Yoon et al., 2011 ). They integrated the results of previous studies, comprising 11,834 cases and 15,233 controls. Genotypes were determined according to the allelic designation and allelic frequencies of the Icelandic study.  

SNP41 had the most signi ﬁ cant association with stroke in Icelandic population. A meta-analysis carried out by  Staton et al. (2006)  showed a signi ﬁ cant association of SNP41 with stroke ( Staton et al., 2006 ). In the present study also we found a signi ﬁ cant association of SNP41 with stroke.  Bevan et al. (2008)  observed that SNP41 along with other genetic variants was robustly and re prod uci bly associated with stroke. The data from decode study were excluded in this study ( Bevan et al., 2008 ).  

Evaluating the association of SNP56 and SNP41 with stroke sub types, we found signi ﬁ cant association of TT genotype (in either case) with large artery, cardio embolic and lacunar stroke   $'p{<}0.001.$  ). SNP56 also associated with stroke of determined and stroke of undetermined etiology. Greta rs do ttir et al. (2003)  also found signi ﬁ cant association of SNP41 with carotid and cardiac stroke. Although meta-analysis carried out by Bevan et al. (2008)  did not  ﬁ nd a signi ﬁ cant association of SNP56 with overall stroke, however, they observed a signi ﬁ cant association of this SNP with cardio embolic stroke.  

Further while sequencing the PCR products of the region bearing SNP56 we found a novel SNP (59736747  $\mathrm{T}\!>\!\mathrm{G}$  ). The novel SNP was found in patients as well as controls. Evaluating the association of this novel SNP with stroke we did not  ﬁ nd a signi ﬁ cant difference in the genotypic as well as allelic frequency between patients and controls.  

Numerous studies published as a follow-up to the original article by deCODE group are divided between those that claim replication and those who did not. The discrepancies in the results might be on account of the ethnic differences and other factors. In spite of all these discrepancies the polymorphisms of PDE4D are signi ﬁ cant risk factors for stroke among different ethnic groups. Therefore, investigations are warranted to evaluate possible ethnic speci ﬁ c effects.  

Expression of PDE4D is abundant in neurons and in vessel cells ( Zhang et al., 2002 ). PDE4D and other members of PDE4D gene family are selectively inhibited by Rolipram ( Block et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2002 ). Rolipram has been reported to attenuate neuronal cell death after transient ischemia ( Block et al., 1997; Kato et al., 1995 ). It has also been reported that the Rolipram signi ﬁ cantly increases the survival of nascent neurons, accompanied by enhancement of phospho-CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) staining and decreased new born cell death after ischemia ( Sasaki et al., 2007 ). These observations indicate that genetic variants of PDE4D might modulate the PDE4D/cAMP pathway leading to the alteration of neuronal properties and possibly rendering neurons undergo permanent damage after a pre ischemic insult. Inhibition of PDE4 has also been reported to decrease leukocyte endothelial cell interaction by reducing adhesion molecule expression in response to proin ﬂ ammatory stimuli ( Blease et al., 1998; Sanz et al.,

For GG vs .  TT,  $\chi^{2}\!=\!0.2$  ;  $p\!=\!0.5$  , odds ratio  $=1.272$   (  $95\%$   CI; 0.5207 – 3.108). For GG vs .  $\uppi\!+\!\mathrm{T}G$  ,  $\chi^{2}\!=\!0.9$  ;  $p\!=\!0.6$  , odds ratio  $=\!1.22$   (95% CI; 0.501- 2.96). For G vs .  T,    $\chi^{2}\!=\!1.1;p\!=\!0.2$  , odds ratio  $=1.13$   (  $95\%$   CI; 0.89 – 1.42).  

2002 ). Further selective PDE4 inhibition also decreased smooth muscle cell activation after vascular injury in an animal model ( Kondo et al., 1999 ). Therefore, PDE4D gene polymorphism needs to be investigated thoroughly not only in relation to susceptibility but also with regard to responsiveness to treatment. PDE4D may become a novel target for stroke prevention and treatment.  

In conclusion the present study suggests that genetic variants of PDE4D are signi ﬁ cant risk factors for stroke in the South Indian Population from Andhra Pradesh. This is also supported by our previous study ( Munshi et al., 2009 ). Therefore, our study adds independent support to the role of PDE4D gene variants in the development of stroke.
