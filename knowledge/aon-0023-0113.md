#  Abstract  

Background:  Previous studies examining the association of  apo lipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphism with the risk of  ischemic stroke (IS) have yielded conflicting results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between APOE ε4 gene polymorphism and risk of IS.  

Summary:   A literature search for genetic association studies  published before May 30, 2015, was conducted in the  PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases. The following search terms were used: (apo lipoprotein E) or (APOE)  and (ε4) and (polymorphism) or (polymorphisms) and (‘ischemic stroke’ or ‘IS’) and (‘cerebral infarction’ or  $\prime{\sf C I}^{\prime}$  ) and (‘genetic polymorphism’ or ‘single nucleotide polymorphisms’  or ‘SNP’). ORs and  $95\%$   CIs were used to calculate the strength  of association. Begg’s funnel plot was used to assess the potential for publication bias. In our meta-analysis, 26 case– control studies involving 6,397 IS cases and 19,053 controls  were included. Overall significant association between carrier of    $\upvarepsilon{4}$   allele and risk of IS was observed (OR 1.43,   $95\%$   CI  1.10–1.85,  $\mathsf{p}\,{=}\,0.0077$  ). In the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, a significant association between Apo ε4 carrier and  risk of IS was observed in Asian studies (OR 1.53,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}\,1.04-$  2.25,   $\mathsf{p}=0.031$  ) whereas borderline significant association  between APO ε4 carrier and risk of IS was observed in Caucasian studies (OR 1.36,   $95\%$   CI 0.95–1.93,   $\mathsf{p}=0.093.$  ).   Key  Messages:  Our meta-analysis suggests that APOE ε4 allele is  associated with higher risk of IS in Asian population as compared to Caucasian population.   $^\copyright$  2016 S.

#  Introduction  

Stroke is the second major leading cause of death and  adult disability after ischemic heart disease  [1] . Stroke has  accounted for nearly 5.7 million deaths globally and   $87\%$  of these deaths take place in low and middle income nations  [2] . In the last 4 decades, incidence of stroke in  South Asian countries has been amplified by more than   $100\%$   while this is decreased by   $42\%$   in the developed   European countries  [3, 4] . This increase in the incidence  of stroke in developing countries could have been influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Ischemic  stroke (IS) is a multi factorial, polygenic disease and comprises of   $80–85\%$   of overall stroke  [5] . Epidemiological  and animal studies have robustly recommended genetic  influence in the pathogen es is of IS.  

Apo lipoprotein E (  APOE  ) gene is one of the commonly studied genes in vascular and neuro degenerative diseases, which is located on chromosome 19q13.2  [6] . Its  protein products are composed of glycoprotein with 3  common isoforms E2, E3 and E4 encoded by the respective alleles ε2, ε3 and ε4 giving rise to 6 genotypes. Apo-E  protein plays an important role in lipid metabolism and  transport and is also significantly expressed in the brain.  There is substantial evidence of association between Apo  ε4 allele and elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol  levels and thereby there is an increase in the risk of cardio vascular disease  [7–10] . It has been shown that elevated level of ApoE in plasma is an important risk factor for  stroke. Several studies have shown inconsistent results for  the association between   APOE  gene polymorphism and  risk of IS  [11] . Factors responsible for inconsistent results  include different study designs and inadequate characterization of phenotypes, variation in sample size and lack of  proper case–control matching. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between   APOE gene polymorphism and risk of IS.  

#  Methods  

Identification of Relevant Studies  

A literature search for genetic association studies published before May 30, 2015, was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE and  Google Scholar databases. The following search terms were used: 

 (apo lipoprotein E) or (APOE) and (ε4) and (polymorphism) or 

 (polymorphisms) and (‘ischemic stroke’ or ‘IS’) and (‘cerebral infarction’ or  $\mathrm{\textdegree}$  ) and (‘genetic polymorphism’ or ‘single nucleotide  polymorphisms’ or   $\overleftrightarrow{\mathrm{SNO}},$  . We included studies that were conducted on human subjects and the studies were searched without  any limitations on language. We thoroughly reviewed all the references to find out the relevant published studies in the literature.  

#  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  

The inclusion criteria for the studies were as following: (1)  case–control studies exploring the association between the APOE  ε4 gene polymorphism and risk of IS, (2) diagnosis of IS according  to World Health Organization and (3) studies with enough reported genotypic and allelic data. The exclusion criteria were: (1)  study design other than case–control study, (2) publications with  overlapping cases and controls from the similar study and (3) no  genotypic data available. We followed the Preferred Reporting  Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)  guideline  [12] .  

#  Data Extraction  

Two authors (A.K. and P.K.) separately reviewed each full-text  article for eligibility and extracted the data. Any disagreements  were resolved by discussion among all the authors.

Quality Assessment  

We also checked the methodological quality of each study using  a methodological quality assessment scale  [13] for the genetic association studies and it was modified by us to increase the relevance of our study. This scale took into account both traditional  epidemiological considerations and genetic issues. The scores  ranged from 0 (worst) to 16 (best). Details of the scale items are  presented in  table 1 . Two authors (A.K. and P.K.) independently

assessed the quality of included studies. Discrepancies over quality  scores were resolved by discussion among all the authors and subsequent consensus was reached.  

#  Statistical Analysis  

Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using the chi-square test  was used to check the distribution of genotypes. Pooled OR and   $95\%$   CI were used to test the magnitude of association between the  APOE ε4 gene polymorphism and risk of IS. Heterogeneity between studies was checked by using I  2  metric  [14] .  $\bar{\mathrm{I}^{2}}\!>\!50\%$   was  considered as presence of significant heterogeneity. Fixed effects  model was used when  $\mathrm{I}^{2}<\!5\bar{0\%}$  , or else random effects model was  used. Along with an overall comparison, stratified analysis on the  basis of ethnicity and age was used to explore whether differences  in association are present between different ethnicities and different age groups. Begg’s funnel plot was used to assess the potential  for publication bias. All the statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 13.1 software.  

#  Results  

A total of 62 published articles were identified using  the pre-specified search strategy.  Figure 1  represents a  flow chart of included and excluded studies along with  their causes for exclusion. Out of 62 retrieved articles, 21  studies were excluded because they were irrelevant to our  interests, 6 studies were excluded as they were in duplicate records, 7 studies were excluded due to conducted in  other than IS and 2 studies were excluded as they were not  of case–control study design. Keeping the inclusion criteria in mind, 26 case–control studies were included in our  meta-analysis. Based on ethnicity, studies were carried  out in 2 major ethnic populations; 11 studies were conducted in Asian while 15 studies were conducted in Caucasian population. We found the studies published in the  literature from year 1993 to 2013. The genotype distribution in controls of 12 studies included in the present meta-analysis was in accordance with HWE. The methodological qualities of most of the studies were found to be  moderately high. Out of 26 studies, the source of controls  was hospital based in 13 studies, population based in 10  studies and 3 studies did not report their source of controls. A summary of the characteristics and methodological quality of the included studies in the present metaanalysis are mentioned in  table 2 .  

A total of 26 case–control studies involving 6,397 cases and 19,053 controls were included in our meta-analysis. Overall, a significant association between carrier of ε4  allele and risk of IS was observed (OR 1.43,  $95\%$   CI 1.10– 1.85,  $\mathsf{p}\,{=}\,0.007\rangle$  ). In the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, significant association between Apo ε4 carrier and  risk of IS was observed in 11 Asian studies involving 2,327  IS cases and 2,546 controls (OR 1.53,  $95\%$   CI 1.04–2.25,   $\mathsf{p}=0.031)$  ) but borderline significant association was observed in 15 Caucasian studies involving 4,070 IS cases  and 15,507 controls (OR 1.36,   $95\%$  CI 0.95–1.93,   ${\tt p}={\tt}$  0.093). A significant heterogeneity was observed   $(\mathrm{I}^{2}\,=$

We analyzed the data using meta-regression analysis  to explore whether age plays a significant role in the association between Apo-E polymorphism and risk of IS  and found that increasing age is associated with decrease  in effect size of association of APOE polymorphism with  the risk of IS   $({\mathfrak{p}}=0.05$  ;  fig. 4 ). Further stratified analysis  based on age category grouped as  ${\le}60$   and   ${>}60$   years was  done, and we found patients with IS having age  ${\le}60$   years  (OR 2.54,  $95\%$   CI 2.13–3.02) and age  ${>}60$   years (OR 1.19,   $95\%\,\mathrm{CI}\,1.08–1.32\rangle$  ) had a significant association of APO-E  ε4 genotype with the risk of IS ( fig. 5 ).

#  Discussion  

There is evidence about the involvement of genetic  factors for development of IS. In the present meta-analysis, we investigated the association between Apo-ε4  gene polymorphism and risk of IS. Our study results suggest that there is a higher risk of IS in subjects who are  carriers of ε4 allele of   APOE   gene. Our findings are consistent with the previously published meta-analysis  [15]  involving 4,096 IS cases and 16,117 controls suggesting  Apo-E polymorphism contributes to the risk of stroke  (OR 1.11,  $95\%$   CI 1.01–1.22). A recently published metaanalysis suggested that APO-ε4 allele is associated with  increased risk for cerebral infarction in Chinese population  [16] .  

We also conducted a subgroup analysis based on ethnicity and observed that the Apo-ε4 carrier allele is more  prone to have the risk of IS in Asian population as compared to the Caucasian population. In the current study,  we observed that 14 studies were deviated from HWE and  a potential publication bias with significant heterogeneity  was found.  

We conducted a meta-regression analysis using mean  age of cases of individual study as continuous variables  and found out that increasing age is associated with decrease in effect size of association of APOE polymorphism with the risk of IS   $({\tt p}=0.05$  ;  fig. 4 ). Furthermore,  we stratified the data on the basis of the age category as   ${\le}60$   and  ${>}60$   years and observed that patients with IS hav

ing age  ${\le}60$   years had significant association of APOE ε4  genotype with the risk of IS with an OR 2.54 and  $95\%$   CI  2.13–3.02 while patient with IS having age  ${>}60$   years had  a significant association with an OR 1.19 and   $95\%$   CI  1.08–1.32 ( fig. 5 ).  

There were a few limitations in our study. (1) Some  studies included in the meta-analysis had small sample  size and may have provided inconsistent results due to  low statistical power. (2) Stroke risk varies as per specific  subtypes of stroke; however, most of the studies included  in the meta-analysis have not presented the data as per  subtype of stroke; therefore, meta-analysis based on association between APOE polymorphism and subtype of  stroke has not been done. (3) The use of different methodologies for genotyping method, selection of controls  and matching criteria may have led to heterogeneity. (4)  Heterogeneity may also be due to the variations in ethnicity, age and environmental factors. (5) Survival bias may  be present in included case–control studies as these studies may not be designed to recruit the critically ill patient  at the acute onset.  

In spite of the limitations listed above, our findings  demonstrate that Apo-ε4 allele is associated with increased risk of IS. Our meta-analysis suggests that IS patients have higher frequency of ε4 allele in Asian population than in Caucasian population. To explore a definitive  conclusion, further well designed and large sample size  epidemiological studies are needed to be performed in the  near future.

Stratified analysis based on mean age of the cases in individual study   ${\le}60$   and  ${>}60$   years suggests that age   ${\le}60$  years had double OR (OR 2.54) as compared to those who had mean age   ${>}60$   years (OR 1.19).
