# Abstract  

Background and Purpose:  Carotid plaque is a heritable trait and a strong predictor of vascular  events. Several loci have been identified for carotid plaque, however, studies in minority  populations are lacking. Within a multi-ethnic cohort, we have identified individuals with extreme  total carotid plaque area (TCPA), i.e. higher or lower TCPA than expected based on traditional  vascular risk factors (age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, etc). We hypothesized that these  individuals are enriched with genetic variants accounting for the plaque burden that cannot be  explained by traditional vascular risk factors. Herein, we sought to identify the genetic basis for  TCPA using the multi-ethnic cohort.  

Methods:  340 participants (170 from each extreme group) from three race/ethnic groups   $53\%$    Hispanic,  $29\%$   non-Hispanic black,  $18\%$   non-Hispanic white) were genotyped using a genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and imputed using 1000Genome data. SNPbased analyses using logistic regression and gene-based analyses using VEGAS2 were performed  within each race/ethnic group and then meta-analyzed. Genes with  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$   were included in an  over representation enrichment pathway analysis using WebGestalt. Promising findings were tested  for association with ischemic stroke using the MEGASTROKE Consortium dataset.  

Results:  No SNP or gene reached genome-wide significance. In the pathway analysis,  GO:0050913 (sensory perception of bitter taste) gene set were significantly enriched   $(\mathrm{P=}4.5\times10^{-6}$  ,   $\mathrm{FDR}{=}0.04$  ), which was confirmed in MEGASTROKE   $\mathrm{(P{=}0.01}$  ). Within the GO:0050913 gene set,  three genes were associated with extreme TCPA in our study   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.001)$  ): TAS2R20, TAS2R50, and  ITPR3. In TAS2R50, rs1376251 is the top SNP and has been associated with myocardial  infarction by others. In ITPR3, a SNP with high regulatory potential (rs3818527,  Re gulo me Score  $\scriptstyle{:=1\mathrm{f}}$  ), and ITPR3 itself were among the top SNP-based and gene-based results and  showed consistent evidence for association in all ethnic groups   $_{({\small\mathrm{P}}<0.05)}$  .  

Conclusions:  Extreme TCPA analysis identified new candidate genes for carotid plaque in  understudied populations.

Carotid plaque is a sub clinical marker of atherosclerosis and well-established predictor of  stroke and myocardial infarction 1 . Vascular risk factors including blood pressure, pack-years  of smoking, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and diabetes constitute a small portion of  variation in carotid plaque 2 , suggesting that genetic factors may explain much of the  remaining trait variability. This is supported by studies which report heritability estimates  for carotid plaque ranging from  $17\%{-}78\%^{3-5}$  . Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in  European populations have identified SNPs in PIK3CG, LDLR, EDNRA and LRIG1 which  influence carotid plaque 6 . Genome-wide linkage 3  and subsequent targeted association  studies  in Dominican families have identified four regions linked to carotid plaque;  however, more large-scale genome-wide association studies in minority populations are  lacking.  

One strategy to identify genetic contributions to complex traits is to apply an extreme  phenotype approach 8 . For this approach, residual trait values are obtained by regressing out  traditional non-genetic risk factors. Individuals in the tail ends of the resulting residual  distribution are then selected for analyses. These resulting sample subsets are more  “genetically loaded” compared to population-based studies due to the removal of traditional  non-genetic risk factor effects, thus providing greater statistical power to detect genetic  associations.  

Using data from the NINDS Novel Factors for Unexplained Phenotypes of Sub clinical  Carotid Atherosclerosis study in an urban multi-ethnic community cohort, we have  previously identified individuals whose total carotid plaque area (TCPA) was significantly  higher or lower than expected after regressing out established traditional vascular risk  factors 2 . This subset of extreme discordant individuals represents a unique sample to  efficiently identify genetic variants influencing carotid plaque. Using this sample, we  

performed a genome-wide association study, at SNP, gene, and pathway level to identify the  genetic basis of TCPA.  

# Methods  

# Data Availability  

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author  upon reasonable request.  

# Study Population  

Subjects in this study are nested within the population-based Northern Manhattan Study  (NOMAS), which has been described previously . In brief, NOMAS participants were at  least 40 years of age, stroke-free and resided for at least three months in a household with a  telephone in northern Manhattan. All subjects provided informed consent. The study was  approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Columbia University and the University of  Miami.  

# Carotid plaque phenotypes  

High-resolution B-mode 2-dimensional carotid ultrasound was performed according to  standard scanning and reading protocols 10 . Bilateral carotid bifurcations and internal and  common carotid arteries were examined for plaque, defined as an area of focal wall  thickening  $50\%$   greater than surrounding wall thickness. Once detected, in-depth imaging of  plaques was performed in long axes and multiple angles. The optimized and normalized  images were analyzed offline by the automated computerized edge detection system M’Ath  (Intelligence in Medical Technologies, Inc, Paris, France) and the area of each plaque was  measured in  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$  . The sum of all plaque areas in all carotid segments within each subject  was expressed as TCPA 2 .  

# Demographic, clinical and diet phenotypes  

Demographic characteristics and vascular risk factor data were collected during a  standardized interview 11 . Details of follow-up procedures have been described previously 12 .  Diet data was collected via a modified Block National Cancer Institute food-frequency  questionnaire administered at baseline 13 .  

# Genotyping, imputation and quality control  

Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0.  Extensive quality control at both the sample and SNP levels was carried out to ensure the  integrity of the genotype data. Samples were excluded if they had call rates below  $95\%$  ,  relatedness, sex discrepancies or were outliers beyond six standard deviations from the mean  based on Eigenstrat analysis 14 . This resulted in a final set of 908 Hispanics, 254 nonHispanic black and 153 non-Hispanic white participants (1,315 total). SNPs with severe  deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium   $(\mathbb{P}{<}10^{-5})$   or a genotyping call rate  $<95\%$   were  removed using PLINK  $1.07^{15}$  . These data were then imputed separately within each race/ ethnic group using IMPUTE2 16  with the 1000 Genomes Phase I, version 3 reference panel.  

SNPs were subsequently removed if they had an imputation quality score  ${<}0.4$   or the minor  allele frequency was  ${<}0.05$  .  

# Statistical analysis  

Selection of individuals with extreme TCPA phenotypes has been described previously 2 .  Briefly, among our study participants, the residual TCPA for each participant was  determined by regressing TCPA on known risk factors (age, sex, pack years of smoking,  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, low LDL-C/HLD-C ratio, homo cyst eine levels, high school  completion, lipid lowering medication and white blood cell count). We then identified the  individuals in the upper (unexplained excess of atherosclerosis; UEAth) and lower  (unexplained protection against atherosclerosis; UPAth) extreme  $10\%$   threshold of the  residual distribution for Hispanics. Thus, the UEAth group had more than expected plaque  and UPAth had less than expected plaque based on traditional environmental risk factors.  Due to the smaller sample sizes in the black and white samples, we identified individuals in  the extreme  $20\%$   threshold of the residual distribution in these samples to increase sample  sizes for analysis.  

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as vegetable and fruit  consumption between the two groups were compared using chi-square tests for categorical  variables and t-tests for continuous variables using SAS v. 9.3. To evaluate the association  between extreme TCPA and each SNP, logistic regression was performed under an additive  genetic model. Principal components (PCs) were derived in each race/ethnic group  separately using Eigenstrat and the first three PCs were included in Hispanic analyses and  the first two PCs were included in the black and white analyses. Regression analyses were  implemented in PLINK v.1.07 and were performed separately within each race/ethnic group.  Evidence for inflation of test statistics (lambda) was monitored. SNP-based results were  meta-analyzed in METAL 17  using an inverse-variance weighting scheme. Gene-based  analyses were performed using VEGAS2 18  with  $+/-10\tt{k b}$   gene boundaries. Linkage  d is equilibrium (LD) patterns for each gene were estimated using 1000 Genomes reference  panels for Europeans (NOMAS white sample) and Africans (NOMAS black sample), and a  custom sample of 200 randomly-selected NOMAS Hispanic samples (NOMAS Hispanic  sample). Gene-based results were meta-analyzed using Fisher’s Method for combining pvalues, implemented in SAS v.9.3.  

Genes with  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$   in our gene-based meta-analysis results were included in an  over representation enrichment pathway analysis using WebGestalt 2019 19 . For this analysis,  KEGG pathways 20  and the gene ontology biological process gene sets were examined .  For a reference pathway/gene set to be included in the over representation enrichment  analysis, it had to consist of 5–2000 genes. Bonferroni correction was applied to account for  multiple comparisons.  

# Validation analysis  

Replication of the extreme TCPA association requires an external cohort with carotid plaque  measurement and extensive traditional risk factors collected to create the extreme phenotype.  Due to the limited access to a dataset of this kind, and given that carotid plaque is a strong  predictor for vascular events 23 , we performed an in silico lookup in the MEGASTROKE  Consortium to determine if our most strongly associated SNPs, genes and pathways were  associated with ischemic stroke. Details of MEGASTROKE have been previously  published 24 . Briefly, 29 studies consisting of multi-ancestry individuals contributed 67,162  stroke cases and 454,450 controls to the MEGASTROKE Consortium.  

# Functional investigation of top SNPs  

To determine possible functional effects of candidate SNPs, we used data from the GTEx  Consortium via the GTEx Portal ( https://gtexportal.org/home/ ) to identify eQTLS. Lastly,  we identified potential regulatory effects using regulomedb 25 .  

# Results  

# Participant Characteristics  

A total of 170 individuals in each extreme group were included in the present study.  Characteristics of study participants are shown in Table 1. The Unexplained Excess of  Atherosclerosis (UEAth) were slightly younger, more educated, had lower LDL-C and a  lower prevalence of diabetes compared to the Unexplained Protection against  Atherosclerosis (UPAth) group.  

# SNP-based analysis  

Results of the SNP-based analysis are shown in Figure 1. While no SNPs met genome-wide  significance in the meta-analysis   $(\mathrm{P}{<}5.0{\times}10^{-8})$  ), rs929397782 and rs3818527 were  suggestively associated with extreme TCPA   $(\mathrm{P}{<}5.0{\times}10^{-6}$   in the meta-analysis). The minor  allele of both SNPs was consistently associated with lower carotid plaque in each race/ethnic  group   $(\mathrm{P=}0.05\mathrm{\sim}3.6\mathrm{X}10^{-5}$  , Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1). rs 929397782 is an intronic  SNP in RERE on chromosome 1 and rs3818527 is an intronic SNP in ITPR3 on  chromosome 6. The ITPR3 SNP had a regulomedb score of 1f, meaning it likely affects  protein binding with DNA and has great functional potential. In addition, it is an e-QTL for  ITPR3 expression in blood   $\mathrm{(P{=}1.3X10^{-24}}$  , GTEx Consortium).  

# Gene-Based analysis  

While no genes met genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis   $(\mathrm{P}{<}2.8{\times}10^{-6})$  ), 15 genes  showed suggestive evidence for association with extreme TCPA (  $_{\mathrm{P<}0.001}$  , Table 3). In the  meta-analysis, UQCC2 and ITPR3 were the only genes that were consistently associated in  all race/ethnic groups (Table 3). Interestingly, UQCC2 is next to ITPR3 on chromosome 6,  and LD structure in the region suggests that the two genes represent one primary locus for  the association signal.  

# Pathway-based analysis  

In the over representation pathway analysis, the KEGG taste transduction pathway and the  Gene Ontology GO:0050913 (sensory perception of bitter taste) gene set were significantly  enriched after accounting for multiple testing (Taste transduction  $\scriptstyle\mathrm{P}=7.1\times10^{-5}$  ,  $\mathrm{FDR}{=}0.02$  ;  GO:0050913  $\mathrm{P{=}}4.5{\times}10^{-6}$  ,  $\mathrm{FDR}{=}0.04$  ). Three genes with  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$   in our meta-analyses,  

ITPR3, TAS2R20, and TAS2R50, were members of the taste transduction pathway/ GO:0050913. TAS2R20 and TAS2R50 reside in chromosome 12p13.2, together with more  than a dozen of taste receptor genes in the region with high LD. Within TAS2R50,  rs1376251 was our most strongly associated SNP in Hispanics and showed suggestive  evidence for association with extreme TCPA in the meta-analysis   $(\mathrm{P=}6.9\times10^{-4}$   in Hispanics,   $\mathrm{P{=}0.049}$   in meta-analysis). Three studies have previously reported that rs1376251, a  missense SNP, is associated with myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease in  general 26–28 . Further, rs1376251 is a strong e-QTL   $(\mathrm{P=}1.7{\times}10^{-121}\sim3.8{\times}10^{-5}$  , GTEx  Consortium) for 15 taste receptor genes in 12p13.2. These taste receptor genes are expressed  in various tissues including thyroid, brain, nerve, lung, gastro-intestinal tract, and artery.  

# Clinical Validation  

As a clinical functional validation, we performed a look-up in MEGASTROKE to determine  if our most strongly associated SNPs, genes, and pathways were associated with ischemic  stroke. Similar to our analysis strategy, MEGASTROKE performed a gene set enrichment  analysis using top genes   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.001)$   associated with ischemic stroke from gene-based  analyses. None of the SNPs presented in Table 2 were associated in MEGASTROKE,  however, in gene-based analyses, CREB3L3 was associated with ischemic stroke   $\scriptstyle(\mathrm{P=}0.01\$  ).  Further, the Gene Ontology biological process gene set, GO:0050913 (Sensory perception of  bitter taste) was enriched for association with ischemic stroke (meta-analysis  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.01}$  ) in  MEGASTROKE.  

# Dietary preferences in extreme TCPA group  

Taste sensation is a major determinant of food selection. Variants within the taste receptor  gene family have been associated with dietary preferences 29 . For example, some individuals,  labeled “super-tasters,” are more sensitive to bitter compounds, especially those present in  vegetables 30 . Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that taste transduction pathway genes  contribute to at hero sclerotic plaque development via influencing dietary preferences. To  explore this possibility, we performed a diet analysis comparing vegetable and fruit intake  between the two extreme plaque phenotype groups. Among Hispanics, vegetable  consumption was significantly increased in UPAth individuals while no differences in fruit  intake were observed (Table 4). No differences in vegetable or fruit intake were observed in  our black or white samples, likely due to smaller sample sizes.  

# Discussion  

We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genes for carotid plaque in a  multi-ethnic sample. We employed an extreme phenotype approach designed to identify  “genetically loaded” individuals with higher and lower amount of carotid plaque than  expected based on their traditional non-genetic risk factors. We also included a pathway  analysis which takes advantage of many genes being expressed temporally and allows  individuals to have variation in different genes within the same pathway resulting in a  similar phenotype. Notably, our results suggest that the taste transduction pathway is an  important driver of carotid plaque, as this pathway was significantly enriched among our  most strongly associated genes from gene-based analyses (gene-based meta-analysis  

$\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$   for TAS2R20, TAS2R50 and ITPR3) and the pathway is significantly enriched in  the MEGASTROKE study for association with ischemic stroke. Two members of the taste  transduction pathway, TAS2R20 and TAS2R50, are members of the large TAS2R receptor  family, a collection of G-protein coupled receptors that function in bitter taste reception.  Upon interaction with a bitter tastant, the TAS2Rs propagate taste transduction through  downstream activation of ITPR3 mediated calcium release (Figure 2). Interestingly, the  minor allele of rs1376251, a missense variant in TAS2R50, has been previously associated  with decreased risk of  $\mathrm{M}\mathrm{I}^{26-28}$   and in our study, was more frequent among individuals with  less than expected carotid plaque trait. In addition, rs1376251 is an e-QTL for other TAS2R  receptor family members nearby, making it plausible for the SNP to convey effects on  carotid plaque development via influencing expression of multiple genes in the same  pathway. Although no SNP met genome-wide significance, nor validated, the top SNP in  ITPR3 was consistently associated with extreme TCPA in all ethnic subsets. This SNP,  rs3818527, is an intronic SNP with high functional potential and is an e-QTL for ITPR3  expression in blood.  

There are several plausible mechanisms underlying the observed taste transduction finding.  In our study, Hispanic individuals with lower carotid plaque than expected had an increased  intake of vegetables compared to Hispanic individuals with greater plaque burden than  expected, as well as different allele frequencies for SNPs within the taste receptor genes.  Potentially, this genetic variability in taste receptor genes led to increased bitter taste  sensitivity among those individuals with greater plaque burden than expected, leading to the  avoidance of vegetables and other bitter foods. A previous study showed there may be a link  between dietary intake, including vegetables, and carotid plaque burden 31 ; however, the  exact mechanism relating vegetable intake to at hero sclerotic plaque development is unclear.  

There is another unique possibility, however, that the association between the bitter taste  pathway and carotid plaque is mediated by extra-oral physiology. A wide spectrum of tissues  express TAS2Rs and respond to exposure to bitter taste agonists 32 . Human arteries exhibit  va so dilation when exposed to bitter tastants akin to the broncho dilation observed in human  airway smooth muscle upon exposure to the same bitter tastants 33 . Further, bitter taste  agonists have a strong anti-mitogenic effect on airway smooth muscle preventing airway  remodeling 34 . No such effect has been studied in vascular smooth muscle, but a similar  physiology affecting at hero genesis is possible. The possible effect of bitter taste reception on  at hero genesis may also have important clinical implications for stroke and MI.  

Beyond its involvement in the taste receptor pathway, ITPR3 may also exert effects on  carotid plaque through other mechanisms. The ITPR3 gene encodes inositol 1,4,5- triphosphate (IP3) receptor, type 3 an endoplasmic reticulum protein which releases calcium  intracellular ly following stimulation with IP3. It is expressed in human left ventricular  monocytes and may contribute to the development of arrhythmia s 35 .  

To increase the statistical power of our study, we took an extreme phenotype approach to  create groups that are enriched for genetic burden to TCPA. Replication of such a study  requires an access to individual level data from external cohorts with the same carotid plaque  measurements to create the same extreme phenotype. Due to the limited access to such kind  of dataset and given that carotid plaque is a strong predictor for vascular events 23  , we  carried out a clinical functional validation instead. For this, we performed a look-up within  MEGASTROKE to determine if any of our most strongly associated findings were  associated with ischemic stroke. The MEGASTROKE data confirmed that CREB3L3 was  associated with ischemic stroke in gene-based analysis and the GO:0050913 (Sensory  perception of bitter taste) gene set was enriched for association with ischemic stroke. The  CREB3L3 gene encodes transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding  protein H (CREB-H) which acts as a transcription factor activated by cyclic adenosine  monophosphate stimulation. CREB-H is involved in triglyceride metabolism 36  and ApoA-1  (apo lipoprotein A-I) expression 37 . We have previously shown that ApoA-1 was associated  with less plaque burden in NOMAS 38 ; which in part may be due to the effect of CREB3L3  SNPs on ApoA-1 observed here.  

There are several limitations to our study. First, we could not provide an exact replication  due to the unique sample and analytic approach used in our study. We did, however, perform  a look-up in MEGASTROKE to determine if our top findings were associated with ischemic  stroke. We reported associations with ischemic stroke in CREB3L3 and the sensory  perception of bitter taste genes, which extend our association results in extreme TCPA to a  clinical outcome. Second, our sample size was relatively limited, which may lead to false  negative results. However, the association of our significantly enriched bitter taste gene set  with ischemic stroke in MEGASTROKE supports the statistical significance and clinical  relevance of the bitter taste genes. This highlights the potential of the extreme study design,  which resulted in more homogenous groups giving us greater power to detect associations  despite smaller sample size. Finally, like other genetic association studies, our data do not  provide direct mechanistic understanding of the role of the taste receptor genes in  at hero sclerotic plaque pathogen es is but there are a few plausible mechanisms for the  association between bitter taste genes and carotid plaque.  

In conclusion, using an extreme phenotype approach, we have identified several candidate  genes for carotid plaque pathogen es is, including three members of the taste transduction  pathway: TAS2R20, TAS2R50 and ITPR3. These findings suggest an appealing hypothesis  that puts taste receptors in the focus of the development of atherosclerosis as well as  protection against atherosclerosis. Further studies are needed to investigate the external  validity of these findings and to elucidate mechanisms including whether the bitter taste  receptors influence at hero genesis outside of dietary intake.
