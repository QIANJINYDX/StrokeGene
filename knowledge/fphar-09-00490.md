Front. Pharmacol. 9:490. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00490 Methods: In 582 consecutive patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) scheduled for PCI and treated with ASA and Clop i dog rel, Prasugrel, or Ticagrelor, SNP analysis for rs12566888, rs2768759, rs41273215, rs3737224, and rs822442 was performed. During a follow-up period of 365 days after initial PCI, all patients were tracked for a primary endpoint, deﬁned as a combined endpoint consisting of either time to death, myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke. All cause mortality, MI and ischemic stroke were deﬁned as secondary endpoints.  

Results: Multivariable Cox model analysis for the primary endpoint revealed a sign i cant ly increased risk in homozygous  PEAR1  rs2768759 minor allele carriers (hazard ratio, 3.16;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval, 1.4–7.13,    $p=0.006)$  . Moreover,  PEAR1 rs12566888 minor allele carriers also showed an increased risk in all patients (hazard ratio, 1.69;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval, 0.87–3.27,    $\rho\,=\,0.122)$  , which was marginally signiﬁcant in male patients (hazard ratio, 2.12;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval, 1.02–4.43,  $p=0.045$  ;  $n=425$  ).  

Conclusions:  To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study showing that distinct genetic variants of  PEAR1  are associated with cardiovascular prognosis in high risk patients undergoing PCI and treated with dual anti platelet therapy.

# INTRODUCTION  

Platelet endo the li al aggregation receptor 1 (PEAR1) belongs to a unique family of EGF (epidermal growth factor) repeat-containing trans membrane proteins and is highly expressed in platelets and endo the li al cells ( Nanda et al., 2005 ). Dextran sulfate triggers platelet aggregation via direct activation of PEAR1 ( Vanden brie le et al., 2016 ).  

Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) showed an association between the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PEAR1 and platelet function: rs2768759 and rs12566888 are associated with increased platelet aggregation in healthy individuals and individuals on ASA ( Herrera-Galeano et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2010; Eicher et al., 2016a ). Patients on ASA with ang io graphically conﬁrmed coronary artery disease (CAD) carrying  PEAR1  rs2768759 SNPs were not at higher risk for death, MI, or stroke ( Voora et al., 2011 ). Sparse data exist regarding clinical outcome after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and PCI in patients with CAD carrying  PEAR1  SNPs ( Voora et al., 2011 ). The impact of genetic variants of  PEAR1  on platelet response and outcome in patients with CAD undergoing PCI treated with contempory   $\mathrm{P}2\mathrm{Y}_{12}$  inhibitors has in su cie ntl y been studied ( Xiang et al., 2013 ).  

# METHODS  

# Subjects  

PEAR1 SNP analysis was performed in 582 consecutive, mostly caucasian patients with stable CAD or ACS receiving PCI. Patients were admitted to the department of cardiology of the University of Tübingen, Germany. All subjects gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (Ethik-Kommission an der Me diz in ischen Fakultät der Eberhard-Karls-Universit t und am Universit ts klin i kum Tübingen) (270/2011BO1) and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and the good clinical practice guidelines ( 1997; 2001; 2002 ).  

# Genotyping of  PEAR1  Variants  

Ethylene dia mine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was isolated using the   $\mathrm{\dot{Q}I A m p^{\mathrm{(\widehat{Q})}}}$  DNA Blood Mini Kit System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). On the basis of systematic literature search, candidate genetic variants of  PEAR1 , reported to be of functional or clinical importance and representative allele frequency in Caucasians, were selected ( Herrera-Galeano et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2016 ). Thus, the following polymorphisms of  PEAR1 were analyzed: rs12566888, rs2768759, rs41273215, rs3737224, and rs822442.  

During the whole genotyping process, study personnel assessing outcome was blinded to the genotype information of the patients. As previously described, genotyping for PEAR1 variants was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$  (MALDI-TOF MS) using the MassARRAY Compact system

 (Sequenom, CA, USA) ( Schroth et al., 2007 ) and for quality control,    ${\sim}10\%$   of samples within each assay were retyped. Details of primers and assays are available upon request. In  Table 2  we provide allele frequencies of  PEAR1  variants in the study cohort. A linkage d is equilibrium (LD) map is shown in  Figure 1 .  

# Platelet Function Analysis  

As reported elsewhere ( Geisler et al., 2008 ), blood samples were obtained from venous puncture after loading with   $\mathrm{P}2\mathrm{Y}_{12}$   receptor antagonists and placed in   $4.5\mathrm{-ml}$   plastic tubes containing the anticoagulant lepirudin   $(25\,\upmu\mathrm{g/m})$  ; Reﬂudan, Dynabyte, Munich, ⃝ Germany). Impedance ag greg ome try (Multiplate   analyzer, ROCHE) was used to measure platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid (AA), collagen, and thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) on whole blood samples. Aggregation was quantiﬁed as area under the curve of aggregation units (AU) (area under the curve    $=\mathrm{AU}\times$  min) ( Sibbing et al., 2008, 2009, 2010 ).  

# Follow-Up  

During a follow-up period of 365 days after initial PCI, all patients were tracked for clinical events including all cause death, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. The primary endpoint was deﬁned as a combined endpoint consisting of either ﬁrst occurrence of death, MI or ischemic stroke. Single events of all-cause mortality, MI and ischemic stroke were deﬁned as secondary endpoints. Follow-up for the primary combined

endpoint, performed by telephone interview and/or review of patients’ charts on read mission, was terminated after the ﬁrst occurrence of one of the pre-deﬁned endpoints. Investigators were blinded to the results of laboratory testing.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R-3.3.2 ( R Core Team, 2016 ), including additional packages genetics_1.3.8.1 ( Warnes et al., 2013 ), quantreg_5.33 ( Koenker, 2017 ), SNPassoc_1.9- 2 ( González et al., 2014 ), and survival_2.41-3 ( Therneau and Grambsch, 2000 ).  

Exact tests of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and pairwise linkage d is equilibrium between SNPs in our cohort were computed with R-packages SNPassoc and genetics, respectively. In addition, LDlink (https://analysis tools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink), a web-based application for exploring population-speciﬁc haplotype structure and linkage ( Machiela and Chanock, 2015 ), was used to investigate linkage between SNPs in the European population of the 1000 Genomes Project (EUR,  $n=1{,}006$  ; Phase 3, V1; build 144; http://www.international genome.org) ( 1000 Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2015 ).  

In all subsequent analysis, SNPs were investigated in the dominant (homozygote carriers (hc) of the major allele vs. minor allele carriers) or recessive (major allele carriers vs. hc carriers of the minor allele) genetic model, as indicated. Associations between SNPs and event rates of primary and secondary endpoints were assessed by Fisher’s exact tests. The eﬀects of SNPs on platelet endpoints were investigated by Wilcoxon– Mann–Whitney tests as well as median regression with covariates  $\mathrm{P}2\mathrm{Y}_{12}$   antagonist, reason for admission (stable CAD/type of ACS), arterial hypertension, hyper lipid emi a, smoking, diabetes mellitus, medication (ASA, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, statins), age, gender, and LVEF. Fisher’s exact test and WilcoxonMann-Whitney test were applied as appropriate to study the interrelation between SNPs and clinical variables or baseline characteristics. Kaplan–Meier analysis as well as uni- and multivariate Cox models (using the same covariates as in median regression described above) were used to examine the associations between variants and primary and secondary endpoints. All statistical tests were two-sided and sign i can ce level was deﬁned as   $5\%$  . Unless otherwise stated,  $\it{\Delta}p$  -values were not corrected for multiple testing.  

# RESULTS  

Pairwise linkage d is equilibrium analysis showed a strong linkage between rs41273215, rs3737224, and rs822442, while there was only a weak linkage between these SNPs and rs12566888 or rs2768759 ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, only rs12566888, rs2768759, and rs41273215 were further analyzed.  

As shown in  Table 1 , there were no signiﬁcant or relevant associations between baseline characteristics and all investigated SNPs. Of 579 individuals genotyped for rs12566888, 482 were homozygous for the major allele and 97 were minor allele carriers. Five hundred and forty-three of the Five hundred and eighty-two patients genotyped for rs2768759 were major allele carriers while 39 were homozygous minor allele carriers. In individuals genotyped for rs41273215 461 were homozygous for the major allele and 121 carried the minor allele. As shown in  Table 2 , major allele frequencies in our cohort, consisting of mostly Caucasian individuals, are perfectly in line with major allele frequencies in the European population of the 1000 Genomes Project. In addition, no considerable deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was observed   $(\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}12566888\ p=$  0.439; rs2768759  $p=0.914$  ; rs41273215    $p=0.0397.$  ). Forty of the 582 patients   $(6.8\%)$   were lost to follow up. The patients lost to follow up did not sign i cant ly diﬀer in their baseline  

characteristics as compared to the group remaining in the study. Concerning the primary combined endpoint, multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis with adjustment for age, gender, LVEF, type of ACS or stable CAD, cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyper lipoprotein emi a, smoking or diabetes, as well as medication (ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and anti platelet therapy) revealed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between major and homozygous minor allele carriers of  PEAR1 rs2768759 (  $\begin{array}{r}{\dot{p}=\,0.006;}\end{array}$  ; Wald test) as shown in  Figure 2  and Table 4 . A similar diﬀerence was observed between minor and homozygous major allele carriers of  PEAR1  rs12566888, which however failed to be signiﬁcant   $(p~=~0.122$  ; Wald test,  Figure 3 ).  PEAR1  rs41273215 was not associated with the primary combined endpoint (  $\acute{p}=0.45$  ; Wald test,  Figure 4 ).  

Secondary endpoints also diﬀered between major and homozygous minor allele carriers of  PEAR1  rs2768759 carriers. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed a signiﬁcant association of this SNP with myocardial infarction   $(p$   $=0.013$  ; Wald test) and a borderline signiﬁcant association of rs2768759 and all-cause mortality (  $(p=0.051\$  ; Wald test).  PEAR1 rs12566888 and rs41273215 were not sign i cant ly associated with secondary endpoints ( Table 4 ). Event and incident rates are shown in  Table 3 .  

Platelet volume and count as well as platelet function, measured with diﬀerent agonists, did not diﬀer sign i cant ly between minor and homozygous major allele carriers of rs12566888 or major and homozygous minor allele carriers of rs2768759. Concerning rs41273215, the platelet count was sign i cant ly lower in minor allele carriers as compared to and homozygous major allele carriers (median   $218{,}000/{\upmu\mathrm{l}}$  vs.   $243{,}000/\upmu\mathrm{l},$   Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test    $p\ =\ 0.028,$  , median regression    $p=0.0365$  ). Likewise, TRAP induced platelet aggregation indicated a lower platelet reactivity in rs41273215 minor vs. homozygous major allele carriers allele carriers (median 75 vs. 83; Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test    $p=0.0094,$  , median regression    $p\,=\,0.0042)$  ). Platelet aggregation induced by ADP, arachidonic acid and collagen under dual anti platelet therapy (DAT) was not sign i cant ly associated with any of the investigated  PEAR1  variants. Platelet parameters and function analysis are shown in  Table 5 .  

At discharge,   $66\%$   of the patients were treated with clop i dog rel,   $15\%$   with prasugrel, and   $18\%$   with ticagrelor.  

# DISCUSSION  

Platelet endo the li al aggregation receptor 1, which is highly expressed in platelets and endo the li al cells, is a membrane tyrosine kinase receptor that mediates platelet activation ( Nanda

et al., 2005 ). The gene encoding  PEAR1  is located on the human chromosome 1q23.1 and several SNPs have been described.  

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) showed that PEAR1  gene variants are associated with greater platelet ag greg ability ( Herrera-Galeano et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2010;

Faraday et al., 2011 ) and it has been reported, that SNPs in  PEAR1 are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction ( Lewis et al., 2013 ). Several studies showed an association between SNPs of  PEAR1  and platelet aggregation in response to diﬀerent agonists in healthy individuals: The C allele of SNP rs2768759 is associated with increased collagen, epinephrine, and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. This association was even stronger and more consistent after administration of ASA, suggesting a relationship between the C allele and reduced platelet responsiveness to ASA ( Herrera-Galeano et al., 2008 ). Jones et al. have demonstrated that SNP rs41299597 is associated with an increased expression of  PEAR1  in activated platelets ( Jones et al., 2009 ). In a meta-analysis of GWAS  Johnson et al. (2010)  analyzed platelet aggregation responses to ADP, epinephrine and collagen in 4000 individuals of European ancestry and found  PEAR1  SNP rs12566888 to be genome-wide signiﬁcant for association with ADP-induced aggregation (  ${\boldsymbol{\mathit{P}}}=$   $3.{\overset{.}{4}}\times10^{-12}$  ). Eicher et al. performed a large-scale meta-analysis

of Exomechip association results for platelet count (PTL) in 157,293 individuals and mean platelet volume (MPV) in 157,293 individuals and showed that  PEAR1  is not only associated with

PLT und MPV but also with platelet reactivity ( Eicher et al., 2016b ). In another study, they found a strong association between rs12566888 in  PEAR1  and ADP   $(p\,{=}\,1.51\times10^{-7})$   and thrombininduced   $(p=1.91\,\times\,10^{-6})$   platelet reactivity in platelet rich plasma ( Eicher et al., 2016a ). Several studies on genetic variants of  PEAR1  provided evidence that the intronic SNP rs12041331 alters PEAR1 protein expression and platelet function ( Faraday et al., 2011; Kauskot et al., 2012; Kunicki et al., 2012; Qayyum et al., 2015 ) and Western blotting and ELISA conﬁrmed doseresponse relation between the number of major G alleles at rs12041331 and expression of PEAR1 protein ( Faraday et al., 2011; Izzi et al., 2016 ). For ADP-induced aggregation, the  PEAR1 minor allele was associated with a decreased response ( Kunicki et al., 2012 ).  

PEAR1 is also expressed in endo the li al cells ( Nanda et al., 2005 ) and, as data from several studies indicate, SNPs seem to alter endo the li al function: The major G allele of rs12041331 is associated with higher  PEAR1  expression than the minor A allele, not only platelets but also in endo the li al cells ( Izzi et al., 2016 ). Fisch et al. observed that variation of  PEAR1 sign i cant ly determines endo the li al function. They found a signiﬁcant association between rs12041331 and ﬂow-mediated

dilation of the brachial artery in 641 individuals. Several genes that play an important role in endo the li al function, such as ANG2, ACVRL1,  or  ENG , are highly correlated with  PEAR1 expression and endo the li al cell migration and ang io genesis are inﬂuenced by  PEAR1  ( Fisch et al., 2015 ). An inverse correlation between vascular assembly both  in vitro  and  in vivo  and endo the li al PEAR1 expression was reported, identifying  PEAR1 as a novel modiﬁer of neo ang io genesis ( Vanden brie le et al., 2015 ).  

In patients on aspirin alone or in combination with clop i dog rel, genetic variation in  PEAR1  may aﬀect on-treatment platelet reactivity and be associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. Genetic variants in  PEAR1  inﬂuence platelet aggregation in healthy individuals on ASA (rs2768759, rs12041331) ( Herrera-Galeano et al., 2008; Backman et al., 2017 ) and in aspirin-treated patients with CAD (rs12041331) ( Wurtz et al., 2014 ). Aspirin-treated rs12041331 A-allele carriers in the INVEST-GENES study had sign i cant ly increased risk of myocardial infarction compared with GG homozygotes (odds ratio, 2.03;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval, 1.01–4.09;    $P\,=\,0.048)$  . Also, this SNP was strongly associated with response to dual anti platelet therapy   $(P=\bar{7.66}\,\times\,10^{-9})$  ) ( Lewis et al., 2013 ). In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), A-allele carriers of rs12041331 experienced a cardiovascular event or death more frequently compared with GG homozygotes

 (hazard ratio, 2.62;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval, 0.96–7.10;    $p\,=$  0.059; and hazard ratio, 3.97;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval,   $1.10-$  14.31;    $P\,=\,0.035$  , respectively) ( Lewis et al., 2013 ). However, patients carrying  PEAR1  rs2768759 SNPs, diagnosed with ang io graphically conﬁrmed CAD and treated with aspirin were not at higher risk for death, MI, or stroke ( Voora et al., 2011 ). Yao et al. recently reported, that in Chinese patients with acute myocardial infarction, PEAR1 rs56260937 minor allele predicts adverse ischemic events after PCI ( Yao et al., 2017 ).

We performed linkage d is equilibrium analyses based on 1000 Genomes data, that schowed rs56260937 is moderately linked to rs41273215 (  $\dot{r}=0.55$  ,  $\mathrm{D^{\prime}}=0.74$  ).  

In our entire cohort we could not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant alteration of on-treatment platelet reactivity in individuals carrying variant alleles of  PEAR1  except for decreased TRAP-induced aggregation in minor carriers of rs41273215. In contrast to our results, Herrera-Galeano et al. found that SNP rs2768759 [A/C] is associated with high on-treatment in individuals with premature CAD on ASA ( Herrera-Galeano et al., 2008 ). An association between rs12566888 in  PEAR1  and ADP and thrombin-induced platelet reactivity was described by  Eicher et al. (2016a) . Nevertheless, the individuals investigated in these studies were not treated with  $\mathrm{P}2\mathrm{Y}_{12}$   receptor antagonists and did not undergo PCI. Moreover, the cohort of Eicher et al. comprised only men. An additional subgroup analysis of our cohort revealed that rs12566888 was sign i cant ly correlated with TRAP test in male (median regression    $P\;=\;0.016$  ) but not in female patients   $\mathit{\Omega}^{P}\ =\ 0.78\$  ), suggesting a gender-speciﬁc eﬀect. In contrast, the associations between rs12566888 and ADP as well as rs2768759 and platelet aggregation remained in sign i cant when we investigated men and women separately. In addition, MPV and PTL were not associated with these  PEAR1  variants, which is in line with a large-scale meta-analysis performed by  Eicher et al. (2016b) .  

It has been reported, that in patients undergoing PCI and carrying rs12041331 cardiovascular events and death occur more frequently ( Lewis et al., 2013 ). Rs12041331 is strongly linked to rs12566888 in Caucasians as reported by LDlink ( Machiela and Chanock, 2015 ) based on 1000 Genomes data (EUR,  n  $=1,\!006,$  ). In our cohort, rs2768759 was sign i cant ly associated with the primary endpoint, consisting of all-cause mortality, MI and ischemic stroke. In individuals homozygous for the minor allele, the primary endpoint occurred with an incidence rate of 8.9/100 PY compared to 1.2/100 PY in major allele carriers. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors we found this diﬀerence to be highly signiﬁcant   $\acute{p}=0.006)$  . This diﬀerence could in large parts be attributed to the secondary endpoint MI which occurred with an IR of 5.7/100 PY in individuals homozygous for the minor allele compared to   $0.9/100$   PY in major allele carriers (Wald test    $P\,=\,0.0131$  ). Voora et al. reported that patients carrying  PEAR1  rs2768759 SNPs who were diagnosed with ang io graphically conﬁrmed CAD and treated with aspirin were not at higher risk for death, MI, or stroke ( Sibbing et al., 2010 ). This is not in line with our ﬁndings. However, the individuals investigated by Voora et al. were not treated with  $\mathrm{P}2\mathrm{Y}_{12}$   receptor antagonists and did not undergo PCI.  

In our cohort, in patients who were homozygous major allele carriers of rs12566888, the primary endpoint occurred more frequently (IR of 7.8/100 PY vs. 2.2/100 PY in homozygous major allele carriers vs. minor allele carriers) but failed statistical sign i can ce in multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis (Wald test  $P=0.122J$  ). A recently published study by Yang et al. could also not replicate previous reports suggesting that SNP rs12566888 in  PEAR1  might be a susceptibility gene for cardiovascular complications in Caucasians ( Yang et al., 2017 ). Nevertheless, the individuals studied by Yang et al. did not undergo PCI like our cohort and the fact that the primary endpoint failed to be sign i cant ly associated with rs12566888 in our study collective may also be due to its moderate sample size and possibly genderspeciﬁc eﬀects. Indeed, multivariable Cox modeling revealed a marginally signiﬁcant association between rs12566888 and the combined endpoint in men (Wald test    $\textit{P}=\mathrm{~0.045)}$  ), but not in women   $~(P~=~0.352)$  ). In contrast, the eﬀect of rs12566888 on myocardial infarction or all cause mortality was neither signiﬁcant in the entire cohort nor in the gender subgroups. Of note, the study of Yang et al. and the patients undergoing PCI in  Lewis et al. (2013)  comprised 48.7 and   $60\%$  men, respectively. Altogether, the question whether rs12566888 predicts inferior outcome in patients undergoing PCI warrants further investigation.  

Yao et al. showed that in an Asian cohort of patients undergoing PCI, on-treatment platelet reactivity under ASA and Clop i dog rel was higher in rs41273215 minor allele carriers   $(p\,=\,0.025)$  ) ( Yao et al., 2016 ). In contrast to Yao’s ﬁndings, on-treatment platelet reactivity was not associated with minor allele   $\mathrm{T}$   at rs41273215 in our study of patients of Caucasian ancestry. Though, TRAP-induced platelet reactivity was sign i cant ly lower in individuals carrying this SNP. Moreover, ADP was marginally sign i cant ly lower in male rs41273215 minor allele carriers (median regression    $P\,=\,0.0475$  ) but not in females   $\mathit{\Delta}P\mathit{\Theta}=\mathit{\Theta}0.14)$  ). Jones et al. showed altered platelet reactivity in healthy rs41273215 carriers.  

To prove stability of the model we replaced cardiovascular co medications by additional cardiovascular com or bidi ties including history of myocardial infarction and atrial brillat ion. In summary, most of the associations of PEAR genetic variants with platelet function parameters and clinical outcome remained unchanged.  

To conclude, this is to the best of our knowledge the ﬁrst report of the prognostic impact of selected  PEAR1  SNPs in a cohort of cardiovascular patients with ACS or stable CAD undergoing PCI and treated with contemporary DAPT. We found that rs2768759 predicts adverse outcome regarding the incidence of MI as well as a combined endpoint consisting of all-cause mortality, MI and ischemic stroke. Rs12566888 was only marginally sign i cant ly correlated with the combined endpoint in men and rs41273215 was not found to be sign i cant ly associated with cardiovascular outcome, possibly due to the moderate sample size of our collective. TRAPinduced aggregation was sign i cant ly decreased in minor allele carriers of rs41273215 and in male minor allele carriers of rs12566888. Moreover, there was a strong trend toward lower ADP induced aggregation in male minor allele carriers of rs41273215.  

# LIMITATIONS  

The current study has some limitations. First, it represents a candidate-gene study with all limitations and we cannot rule out inﬂuences of other genetic variants not investigated. Our ﬁndings have not been validated in an independent cohort or a genome-wide association approach. A sample size calculation based on a log-rank test showed that in order to validate the eﬀect of rs2768759 with   $80\%$   power and for a sign i can ce level of   $5\%$  , an additional cohort with at least  $n\,=\,737$   patients would be required (hazard ratio 3.2, event rate   $11\%$  ). The present study is of moderate sample size and observational character and needs replication in further large scale studies. Our ﬁndings also need replication in other ethnic groups as our cohort consists mainly of Caucasian individuals.
