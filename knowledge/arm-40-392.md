Objective   To investigate whether b acul o viral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat containing 5 gene (BIRC5)  polymorphisms are associated with the development and clinical phenotypes of ischemic stroke in Korea population. Methods   We enrolled 121 ischemic stroke patients and 291 control subjects. Ischemic stroke patients were divided  into subgroups according to the scores of National Institutes of Health Stroke Survey (  $\mathord{\check{<}}6$  or  ${\ge}6$  ) and Modified  Barthel Index (  $\cdot{<}60$   or  ${\ge}60$  ). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of BIRC5 (rs3764383 and rs2071214) were  selected and genotyped by direct sequencing for all subjects. Multiple logistic regression models (codominant  1 and 2, dominant, recessive, over dominant and log-additive) were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs),   $95\%$    confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values.  

Results   In analysis of stroke susceptibility, the genotype and allele frequencies of rs3764383 exhibited no  difference between the control group and the ischemic stroke group. SNP rs2071214 was associated with ischemic  stroke in the codominant   $\left(\mathbf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.003\right)$  ), dominant   $\mathbf{(p{=}0.002)}$  , over dominant   $\left({\tt p}{=}0.005\right)$  ), and log-additive   $\left(\mathbf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.008\right)$  )  models, respectively. The G allele frequency of rs2071214 was significantly   $\left(\mathbf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.009\right)$  ) associated with susceptibility  for ischemic stroke (OR, 1.57;   $95\%$   CI, 1.12–2.21). However, in the analysis for clinical phenotype, no SNP of the  BIRC5 gene was found to be associated with ischemic stroke.  

Conclusion   These results suggest that a missense SNP (rs2071214) of BIRC5 may be associated with the  development of ischemic stroke in the Korean population.

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is an acute neurological emergency that can result in long-term disability. It is the second most common  cause of death in Korea [1]. Stroke is generally classified  as either ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. Several  environmental factors are associated with increased risk  of stroke. Several lines of evidences have indicated that  genetic factors are also involved in the development of  stroke [2-4]. Numerous genetic studies have reported  the relationships between stroke and single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes such as methylene tetra hydro folate reductase (MTHFR) [5], tumor protein p53  (Tp53) [6], transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) [7],  gap junction protein alpha 4 (GJA4, also known as connexin 37) [8], and interleukin 10 (IL10) [9].  

Apoptosis or programmed cell death involves complex  signaling pathways and cascades of molecular events.  Normal growth and development of organisms require  maintenance of a dynamic balance between systems that  promote cell survival and those that induce apoptosis.  Intracellular proteases called caspases can degrade cellular contents by pro teo lysis upon activation of the death  pathway.  

B acul o viral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat containing 5 gene (BIRC5) (located in 17q25) is a member of the   $I A P$   gene family. This gene encodes for surviving that  can inhibit caspase activation, thereby leading to negative regulation of apoptosis or programmed cell death. In  mouse model of stroke, survivin expression by cerebrovascular endothelium is up regulated [10]. It is particularly found in the micro vas cula ture within the infarct and  peri-infarct areas [10].  

Recent studies have shown that apoptotic neuronal  death is delayed in the surrounding area of necrotic core,  leading to the propagation of brain damage [11,12]. Many  studies have suggested that apoptosis, necrosis, and oxidative stress may lead to the development of ischemic  cascade. We hypothesized that survivin was associated  with ischemic stroke. Therefore, we evaluated whether  SNPs of the BIRC5 gene were associated with the genetic  susceptibility and clinical phenotypes of ischemic stroke  in the Korean population.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Subjects  

Subjects for this investigation were 121 ischemic stroke  patients who visited the Stroke Center at Kyung Hee University and the emergency room of Kyung Hee Hospital  between October 2007 and April 2011 with onset between  1 week and 1 month. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke,  trauma, hematoma, brain tumors, and accidental or iatrogenic stroke were excluded from this study. All patients  were diagnosed using cranial computed tomography,  magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, or duplex  sonography. Controls   $\mathrm{(n{=}291}$  ) were selected from healthy  subjects who were examined during health check-up.  None of them had any clinical evidence of stroke. Vascular risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyper lipid emi a) were evaluated for all  subjects. All ischemic stroke patients were classified into  two clinical subgroups according to the respective results  of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Survey (NIHSS)  and Modified Barthel Index (MBI). In a previous study,  patients with MBI score higher than 60 required shorter  time of stay at home [13]. In this study, MBI score of 60  appeared to be a reference point for patients who were  dependent or independent requiring only partial assist  [13]. In terms of NIHSS score, score below 6 has been  found to be able to predict good outcome in a study consisting of 1,281 stroke patients [14]. Therefore, we classified stroke patients into clinical phenotypes according to  the NIHSS score of 6 (  $\mathord{\cdot}6$  or  ${\ge}6$  ) and the MBI score of 60  (  $\mathord{\cdot}60$   or  ${\ge}60$  ).  

Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. If patients were unable to communicate, consent  was obtained from their guardians or close relatives. This  study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of  the Medical Research Institute, Kyung Hee University  College of Medicine.  

# SNP selection and genotyping  

Although many studies have explored the potential association between several SNPs (including rs9904341,  rs17878467, rs2071214, and rs8073069) in survivin gene  and the susceptibility to various tumors [15], the associations between these SNPs and the susceptibility to stroke  are not well explored. After searching the dbSNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/), we selected  the following two SNPs: –1547A/G (rs3764383) located in  the promoter region and   $+9194\mathrm{A/G}$   (rs2071214) located  in exon4 (Fig. 1) that had greater than 0.1 he ter oz y gos it y  among SNPs of the BIRC5 gene for this study.  

Peripheral blood sample was collected from each subject for DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted  using QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA,  USA). Genotypes were determined by direct sequencing 

 (MACROGEN, Seoul, Korea). Polymerase chain reactions 

 (PCRs) were performed with the following primers: for  rs3764383 (sense,  $5^{\prime}$  -T GCC TATA AT CCC A GC TACT CA $3^{\prime}$  ;  antisense,  $5^{\prime}$  -CCA GAGA A GTC ACT CCC A CAT T $.3^{\prime}$  ; product  size,   $383{\mathrm{~bp}}$  ) and for rs2071214 (sense,  $5^{\prime}$  -TCACCAGAGCAC GAA AGA ATTA- $3^{\prime}$ ; antisense, $5'$ -G GC TTC T GC TG-TAG TTC A ACC T $3^{\prime}$  ; product size,   $423{\mathrm{~bp}}$  ). PCR products  were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3730XL analyzer  (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). SeqMan II  software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was used to  analyze the sequencing data.  

Sequence data were evaluated using SNPStats (http:// bioinfo.icon co logia.net/index.php?module  $=$  Snpstats),  SNP Analyzer (ISTECH Inc., Goyang, Korea), and HelixTree (Golden Helix Inc., Bozeman, MT, USA). Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was calculated using chisquare test. Logistic regression models (codominant,  dominant, and recessive) were used to determine the  odds ratios (ORs),   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs), and pvalues. The required sample size for statistical power was  estimated using a genetic power calculator (http://pngu. mgh.harvard.edu/\~purcell/  $\mathrm{\tau/gpc/cc2.html}$  ). The significance level for all statistical tests was set at   $\mathrm{p{<}}0.05$  .  

# Statistical analysis  

Chi-square test and Student t-test were used to compare baseline characteristics between the ischemic  stroke group and the control group. SPSS ver. 12.0  (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used as the statistical program and statistical significance was at  $\mathrm{p}{<}0.05$  .  To analyzed the genetic association between BIRC5  polymorphisms and ischemic stroke, multiple logistic  regression analyses with adjustment for age and gender were performed using the following: codominant 1  (major allele homozygotes vs. heterozygotes), codominant 2 (major allele homozygotes vs. minor allele homozygotes), dominant (major allele homozygotes vs.  heterozygotes  $^{,+}$  minor allele homozygotes), recessive  (major allele homozygotes+heterozygotes vs. minor allele homozygotes), and log-additive (major allele homozygotes vs. heterozygotes vs. minor allele homozygotes).  

In the codominant model, every genotype can gives a  different and non-additive risk. Therefore, we compared  the major allele homozygotes (the most frequent alleles)  to heterozygotes in codominant 1 and minor allele homozygotes in codominant 2. In the dominant model, a  single copy of allele was enough to modify the risk with  heterozygous and homozygous genotypes having the  same risk. In the recessive model, two copies of allele  were necessary to change the risk. In the over dominant  model, heterozygotes were compared to both allele homozygotes. In the log additive model, each copy of allele  modified the risk in an additive form.  

# RESULTS  

# Subjects  

The patient population consisted of 121 (67 males and  54 females) ischemic stroke patients. There were 291 (152  males and 139 females) healthy blood donors who visited the center for regular health check-ups. The mean  age of the stroke group was   $65.74\pm12.12$   (mean±standard  deviation) years. The mean age of the control group was   $63.04{\scriptstyle\pm9.36}$   years. Stroke patients were divided according to NIHSS (scores of 13 neurological symptoms;   ${<}6$  or  ${\ge}6$  ) or MBI (scores of 10 activities of general life;   ${<\!60}$  or   ${\ge}60$  ). The number of ischemic stroke patients with  NIHSS scores of   ${<}6$   and   ${\ge}6$   were 56 and 57, respectively.  The number of ischemic stroke patients with MBI scores  of   ${<\!60}$   and   ${\ge}60$   were 71 and 25, respectively. The clini

# Analysis of susceptibility  

The genotype and allele frequencies of the two SNPs are  listed in Table 2. Two SNPs (rs3764383, rs2071214) of the  BIRC5 gene were in HWE in the ischemic stroke group  and the control group. For rs3764383, the frequencies  of AA, AG, and GG genotypes in the control group were   $63.2\%$  ,   $29.6\%$  , and   $7.2\%$  , respectively. Its frequencies of  AA, AG, and GG genotypes in the ischemic stroke group  were   $56.2\%$  ,   $39.7\%$  , and   $4.1\%$  , respectively. Allele frequencies of A and G in the control group were   $78.0\%$   and   $22.0\%$  , respectively. The allele frequencies of A and G in  the ischemic stroke group were   $76.0\%$   and   $24.0\%$  , respectively. No correlation was observed between rs3764383  SNP and susceptibility to ischemic stroke. The frequencies of the AA, AG, and GG genotypes for rs2071214 in the  control group were   $63.5\%$  ,  $30.0\%$  , and   $6.5\%$  , respectively,  and   $47.9\%$  ,  $43.8\%$  , and   $8.3\%$  , respectively, in the ischemic  stroke group, respectively. The missense SNP rs2071214  was associated with ischemic stroke in the codominant   $\left(\mathbf{p}{=}0.003\right)$  , dominant   $\left(\mathbf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.002\right)$  , over dominant   $\left(\mathbf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.005\right)$  ,  and log-additive (  $\mathbf{\tilde{p}}{=}\mathbf{0.008})$   models, respectively.

allele frequency of rs2071214 was significantly   $\left(\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.009\right)$  )  higher in the ischemic stroke group than that in the control group (  $21.6\%$   vs.   $30.2\%$  ; OR, 1.57;   $95\%$   CI, 1.12–2.21).  These data suggested that the rs2071214 SNP of the  BIRC5 gene might be associated with ischemic stroke and  that the G allele of rs2071214 might be a risk factor for the  development of ischemic stroke.  

# Analysis of clinical phenotypes  

In analysis of NIHSS (Table 3), the frequencies of AA,  AG, and GG genotypes for rs3764383 in the   $\mathrm{{\DeltaN I H S S}}{<}6$    group were   $57.1\%$  ,   $41.1\%$  , and   $1.8\%$  , respectively, and   $52.6\%$  ,   $40.4\%$  , and   $7.0\%$  , respectively, in the   $\mathrm{{\ttN I H S S}}{\ge}6$    group.

  $44.6\%$  , and  $8.9\%$  , respectively, in the   $\mathrm{\DeltaNHSS}{<}6$   group, and 

  $49.1\%$  , 43.945, and   $7.0\%$  , respectively, in the   $\mathrm{{\ttN I H S S}}{\ge}6$    group.

  $\mathbf{p{=}}0.86$  ), the dominant model (OR, 0.90;  $95\%$  CI, 0.43–1.90; 

  $\mathbf{p{=}0.79})$  , the recessive model (OR, 0.76;   $95\%$   CI, 0.19–3.05; 

  $\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.7)$  , the over dominant model (OR, 0.98;   $95\%$   CI, 0.46–

 2.06;   $\mathbf{p{=}0.95}.$  ), or the log-additive model (OR, 0.89;   $95\%$    CI, 0.49–1.61;  $\mathbf{p}{=}0.7.$  ).  

Analysis results of MBI are shown in Table 4, the frequencies of the AA, AG, and GG genotypes for rs3764383  were   $57.8\%$  ,   $36.6\%$  , and  $5.6\%$  , respectively in the   $\mathrm{MBI}{<}60\$  group, and   $56.0\%$  ,   $44.0\%$  , and   $0.0\%$  , respectively, in the   $\mathrm{MBI}{\geq}60\$   group.

For rs2071214, the frequencies of the AA, AG, and GG genotypes were   $45.1\%$  , 

  $45.1\%$  , and   $9.9\%$  , respectively, in the   $\mathrm{MBI}{<}60\$   group, and

The rs2071214  was not significantly   $\scriptstyle\left(\mathbf{p}>0.05\right)$   associated with MBI scores  in the codominant model (OR, 0.80;   $95\%$   CI, 0.29–2.22;

Consequently, the BIRC5 gene  polymorphisms (rs3764383 and rs2071214) were not statistically associated with NIHSS scores (  $\mathord{\check{<}}6$  or   ${\ge}6$  ) or MBI  scores   $\zeta{<}60\;\mathrm{or}\,\geq\!60.$  ).  

# DISCUSSION  

Stroke is a multi factorial disease caused by the interactions between several genetic factors and environmental  factors. Recently, the importance of genetic factors in  stroke has been demonstrated. It has been reported that  protein kinase C eta (PRKCH), apelin receptor (AGTRL1),  and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10 (ARHGEF10) are three novel candidate genes for ischemic  stroke in Japan [16,17]. In addition, chromosome 4q25  variants (rs2200733, rs10033464, and rs1906591) have  been associated with the risk of ischemic stroke. Recent  meta-analysis results on the risk effect of chromosome  4q25 variants on ischemic stroke have demonstrated that  SNPs (rs2200733, rs1003346, and rs1906591) on chromosome 4q25 are associated with ischemic stroke risk, particularly card i oem boli c stroke [18,19].  

Development of stroke is associated with multiple  complex interactions such as ex ci to toxicity, acidotoxicity, ionic imbalance, oxidative stress, inflammation, and  apoptosis [20]. Traditionally, neuronal death after cerebral ischemia has been considered entirely as necrotic  in nature. However, research over the past decade has

revealed that many neurons in the ischemic area will undergo apoptosis after stroke [21]. Cerebral ischemia generally triggers the following two pathways of apoptosis:  1) the intrinsic pathway originating from mitochondrial  release of cytochrome c that is associated stimulation of  caspase-3, and 2) the extrinsic pathway originating from  the activation of cell surface death receptors that results  in the stimulation of caspase-8 [11,22].  

The BIRC5 gene (located in 17q25) is a member of the  IAP family. This gene encodes for surviving that inhibits  caspase activation, thereby leading to inhibition of apoptosis [23,24]. In rat model, increased level of survivin has  been found in micro vas cula ture after cerebral ischemia,  suggesting that this protein may play a critical in ischemic stroke with important biological and therapeutic  implications [10].  

It is well-known that gene expression can be influenced  by a SNP located within the promoter and/or other regulatory regions of the gene. Therefore, polymorphisms of  survivin gene may have a functional consequence. It may  affect the production or activity of survivin, thus regulating the susceptibility and clinical severity of ischemic  stroke.  

Our data revealed that a missense SNP (rs2071214)  of BIRC5 was associated with the development of ischemic stroke in the codominant   $\left(\mathbf{p}{=}0.003\right)$  , the dominant   $\left({\mathrm{p}}{=}0.002\right)$  ), the over dominant   $\left({\tt p}{=}0.005\right)$  ), and the logadditive   $\left({\tt p}{=}0.008\right)$   models in the Korean population. The  G allele frequency of rs2071214 in the ischemic stroke  group was significantly   $\mathbf{(p{=}0.009)}$  ) higher than that in the  control group (  $30.2\%$   vs.   $21.6\%$  ; OR, 1.57;   $95\%$   CI, 1.12– 2.21). The genotype and allele frequencies of rs3764383  showed no significant differences between the ischemic  stroke patient group and the control group. There was no  significant association between the survivin SNPs and  the clinical phenotypes of ischemic stroke.  

It has been demonstrated that the –1547 AA genotype of  rs3764383 located in promoter region has a significantly  younger age in ovarian cancer onset (58.8 vs. 70.1 years;   $\mathtt{p{=}0.001}$  ) compared to patients with the –1547 GG genotype [25]. The survivin rs3764383 has been reported to be  significantly associated with a worse prognosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer patients (AG/GG vs. AA; hazard  ratio, 0.78;  $95\%$   CI, 0.62–0.99) [26]. The promoter region  may modify the transcription of survivin. Therefore,  subjects carrying a genotype with higher expression of  survivin may have decreased apoptotic activity to remove  cells with DNA damage [26]. They might have a shorter  survival time and poorer prognosis [26]. On the other  hand, the survivin rs2071214 located in exon4 is a more  common risk factor of tumor in Asians [15]. Survivin  rs2071214 can result in amino acid change from Lys to  GLu at codon 129 in exon 4. CREB-binding protein dependent acetyl ation on lysine 129 can promote nuclear  accumulation of survivin. Acetyl ation at lysine 129 of survivin can lead to its homo dimer iz ation, while deacetylation can promote the formation of survivin monomers  that he t ero dime rize with CRM1 and accelerate its nuclear  export. Oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 is a binding protein of nuclear survivin. Acetylated survivin can  bind to STAT3 and repress oncogenic transcription factor  STAT3 trans activation of target gene promoters [27-29].  Wang et al. [29] have identified that rs2071214 (  $(\mathrm{A}{\Rightarrow}\mathrm{G})$  ) in  a neuroblastoma cell line has defects in survivin nuclear  localization. In vascular endo the li al cells, survivin is upregulated in response to the release of angiogenic growth  factors, including VEGF and Ang-1 [10].  

It has been well-established that estrogens can protect  neuronal death in animal models of cerebral ischemia.  In animals subjected to ischemia, acute post ischemic  estradiol can further enhance the activation and nuclear  translocation of STAT3 and STAT3-dependent transcription of target genes [30]. Recent study has demonstrated  that survivin is a target gene of STAT3 in estradiol neuro protection as evidenced by the ability of shRNA of survivin to reverse neuro protection in ischemia [30]. Several  polymorphisms have been described in the survivin  gene. A recent study has demonstrated that rs17878467  polymorphism of survivin gene is associated with a lower  risk of hemorrhagic transformation in patients with ischemic stroke [31]. The biologic role of amino acid alterations associated with SNPs in ischemic stroke remains  unclear. Nuclear localization of survivin may play a critical role in stroke susceptibility by modifying ischemic  apoptosis, altering familiarity to angiogenic growth factor  including VEGF and Ang-1, and inhibiting or activating  different excitatory enzymes as in tumor.  

The present study has several limitations. First, it is unclear which genetic polymorphisms can predict clinical  phenotypes and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Second,  the exact molecular mechanism of apoptotic neuronal  death caused by rs2071214 was not investigated. Third,  this was a hospital-based case control study with relatively small stroke sample sizes.  

In conclusion, we observed an association between the  development of ischemic stroke in the Korean population  and SNP (rs2071214) of survivin gene. This finding may  provide evidence that the survivin gene may play a role in  the path o physiology of ischemic stroke and that genetic  factor could be responsible for susceptibility to ischemic  infarct in Koreans. To the best of our knowledge, this is  the first study to indicate the plausibility of an association of a BIRC5 SNP with the development of ischemic  stroke. However, additional studies using larger numbers  of cases or other populations to determine the exact molecular mechanisms of apoptotic neuronal death caused  by rs2071214 in cortical neurons are needed to clarify the  biological functions of survivin in ischemic stroke patients.
