Abstract:  Previous genome-wide association studies have showed that several tetra t rico peptide repeat domain protein 39B gene ( TTC39B ) single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs581080 and rs471364) were associated with serum  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels among populations of European ancestry, but the results are inconsistent.  Furthermore, little is known about the association between  TTC39B  SNPs and the susceptibility to coronary heart  disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke (IS). Therefore, this study was undertaken to detect the association between  the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP and serum lipid levels and the risk of CHD and IS in a Southern Chinese Han population. Genotyping of the SNP in 1741 unrelated subjects (healthy controls, 624; CHD patients, 578 and IS patients,  539) was performed by the Snapshot Technology. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the SNP were different  between the control subjects and CHD patients, or between the control subjects and IS patients   $(P\leq0.001)$  ). The  T allele frequency was higher in CHD   $'16.2\%$   and IS   $(15.0\%)$   patients than in controls   $(9.8\%)$  . The T allele carriers  had higher risk of CHD   $0\mathsf{R}=1.728$  ,  $|5\%\,\mathsf{C}|=1.290{\cdot}2.31$  6,  $P<0.001$  ) and IS (  $.0\mathsf{R}=1.518$  ,  $95\%$   $5\%\,{\sf C l}=\underline{{1}}.\underline{{1}}82–2.\underline{{1}}\underline{{1}}6$  6,   $P=0.002)$  ) than the T allele non-carriers after controlling for potential con founders. No significant association was  observed between the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP and all seven serum lipid traits. These results suggest that the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP is associated with the risk of CHD and IS in our study population and does not depend on  serum lipid levels.

# Introduction  

Both coronary heart disease (CHD) and isch- emic stroke (IS) remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide [1-3]. More than  2.5 and 1 million people are affected by stroke  and heart attack, respectively, leading to more  than 2 million deaths each year in China [4].  CHD and IS are multi factorial diseases in which  multiple genes and environmental factors are  involved. The pathologic basis of both diseases  is atherosclerosis, a multi factorial disease consisting of a multitude of pathogenic developments, including foam cell formation, cell  death, extracellular lipid accumulation, chronic  inflammation, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. CHD and IS may share common pathogenesis, as well as many risk factors such as  sex, age, dys lipid emi a, hypertension, diabetes,  cigarette smoking, and family history [4-6]. Twin  and family studies have indicated that heritable  factors account for   $30\%–60\%$   of the interindividual variation in the risk of CHD [7, 8] and IS 

 [9]. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms 

 (SNPs) originally identified as influencing the  risk of CHD were also subsequently associated  with IS [10, 11].  

The tetra t rico peptide repeat domain 39B gene  ( TTC39B ), also known as C9orf52, a high density lipoprotein (HDL) gene discovered in human  genome wide association studies (GWASes)  [12, 13] is located on Chromosome   $9\mathsf{p}22.3$  . It  has ubiquitous expression in kidney, gall bladder and other tissues [14]. There are 27 exons  in this gene. Several previous studies have  showed that the  TTC39B  SNPs were associa-ted with endometriosis (rs519664T,  $P=4.8\times$     $\tt{10^{\cdot10}}$  ,  $\mathsf{O R}=\bot29,$  ) [15], progression-free survival  of epithelial ovarian cancer (rs7874043, best  $P$     $=7\times10^{.5}$  ,   $\mathsf{H R}=1.90$   and rs72700653) [16],  and gallbladder disease (rs686030,  $P=6.95\;\times$     $\mathtt{10^{\cdot7}}$  ,   $\upbeta=0.271)$  ) [17]. In a recent study, we also  found that the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP was  associated with the risk of CHD and IS in a  Southern Chinese Han population, and this  finding may be induced by reducing serum highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels  [18]. However, the results of previous GWASes  between the  TTC39B  SNPs and serum lipid levels are inconsistent. For example, despite suf- ficient power, Dumitrescu et al. [19] were  unable to replicate the previous association of  TTC39B  rs471364 with HDL-C   $(P=3\times10^{\cdot10})$  ) by  Kathiresan et al. [12]. Therefore, the purpose of  the present study was to assess the association of a new  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP and  serum lipid levels and the risk of CHD and IS in  the Chinese population.  

# Materials and methods  

# Patients  

A total of 1,117 unrelated patients (CHD,   $\boldsymbol{\eta}=$    578 and IS,  $n=539$   were recruited from hospitalized patients in the First Affiliated Hospital,  Guangxi Medical University from September  2009 to October 2011. The diagnosis of CHD  was based on clinical manifestation, electrocar dio graphic change, cardiac marker increase,  and coronary angiography. CHD was defined as  coronary ang io graphic findings (significant coronary stenosis   $(\geq50\%)$   in at least either one of  the three main coronary arteries or their major  branches (branch diameter  $\geq2\ \mathsf{m m}$  ) [20]. CHD  patients who had congenital heart disease, cardio my opa thy, or valvular disease were excluded. The diagnosis and classification of IS was  ascertained in accordance with the Trial of Org  10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria [21] after strict neurological examination,  computed tomography, or magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI). Subjects with a history of hematologic or brain MRI revealing cerebral hemorrhage, card i oem boli c or unspecified stroke,  neoplastic or intra cranial space-occupying  lesion, infection, and other types of intra cranial  lesions, renal, liver, thyroid, autoimmune dis- eases, and type 1 diabetes were excluded. The  IS patients who had a past history of CHD and  CHD patients who had a past history of IS were  excluded from the study.  

# Controls  

A total of 624 healthy subjects matched by age,  gender, and ethnic group (Han Chinese) were  consecutively recruited as a control group from  the healthy adults who underwent periodical  medical check-up at the Physical Examination  Center of the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi  Medical University during the same period  when CHD and IS patients were recruited. They  were free of CHD and IS at time of history taking, and underwent clinical, biochemical, and  image examinations such as 64-slice computed tomo graphic coronary angiography. The  study protocol was approved by the Ethics  Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital,  Guangxi Medical University (No. Lunshen  2009-Guike-018; Jan, 7, 2009), and conducted  according to the Declaration of Helsinki.  Informed consent was obtained from all subjects after they received a full explanation of  the study.  

Genotyping and biochemical analysis  

A venous blood sample of   $5~{\mathsf{m L}}$   was obtained  from all subjects after at least 12 hours of fasting. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was  extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes  using the phenol-chloroform method. Geno-types of the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP were  determined by the Snapshot technology platform in the Center for Human Genetics  Research, Shanghai Genesky Bio-Tech Co. Ltd.,  China [22-31]. The restriction enzyme was   SAP (Promega) and Exon ucl ease l (Epicentre).  The sense and antisense primers were  5’-GC AT CCA GT TTT GT TG GAA A A CAT T-3’ and 5’-T-CT GG A CG AT CA ACT TT GT GT ACT TG A-3’, respec- tively. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride  (TG), HDL-C, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in samples were assayed using  common commercially available biochemical  kits. Serum apo lipoprotein (Apo) A1 and ApoB  levels were determined by the immuno turbid imetric immuno as say [22-31]. TC, TG, ApoA1  and ApoB assay kits were purchased from  RANDOX Laboratories Ltd., Antrim, UK; and  HDL-C and LDL-C from Daiichi Pure Chemicals  Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.

General characteristics of the subjects  

TTC39B rs1407977 SNP and the risk of CHD  and IS  

Table 1  shows the general characteristics and  serum lipid parameters of the participants. The  mean values of body weight, BMI, SBP, pulse  pressure, TG, the percentages of cigarette  smoking, and the prevalence of hyper lipid emi a  were higher in the CHD patients than in control  subjects, whereas the levels of DBP, TC, HDL-C,  ApoA1, percentages of alcohol consumption,  and the ratio of ApoA1 to ApoB were lower in  the CHD patients than in control subjects   $'\!P<$    0.05-0.01). There was no significant difference  in the average age, sex ratio, serum LDL-C and  ApoB levels between the CHD patients and control subjects.  

As shown in  Table 2 , the T allele carriers had a  higher risk of CHD (  ${\mathsf{T R}}=1.728$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C l}=1.290.$  2.316,  $P<0.001)$  ) and IS   $(\mathsf{O R}=\mathbb{1}.5\mathbb{18}$  ,   $95\%\,{\sf C l}=$    1.182-2.116,  $P=0.002,$  ) than the T allele noncarriers after adjustment for age, gender, BMI,  cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and  blood pressure.  

Genotypes and serum lipid levels in the control  subjects  

As shown in  Figure 2 , no significant difference  in all seven serum lipid parameters was  observed between the CC and CT/TT geno-types.  

The average levels of body weight, BMI, SBP,  DBP, pulse pressure, TG, the percentages of  cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption,  and the prevalence of hyper lipid emi a were  higher in IS patients than in control subjects,  whereas the levels of TC, HDL-C, ApoA1, and  the ratio of ApoA1 to ApoB were lower in IS  patients than in control subjects   $(P<0.01\$   for  all). There was no significant difference in the

Ibadan, Nigeria ( YRI); respectively. In the present study, we  showed that the  rs1407977T  allele frequency was   $9.8\%$   in  healthy controls,   $16.2\%$   in  CHD patients and   $\pm5.0\%$   in IS  cases   $\bar{P}<0.00\bar{\perp}$    vs.  controls).   These findings revealed that  the  TTC39B  rs1407977  SNP  may have racial/ethnic and  population specificity.

The value of TG was presented as median (interquartile range), and the difference between the genotypes was determined by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The association  between genotypes and the remaining serum lipid parameters was tested by  analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  

The potential association of  the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP   and serum lipid levels has not  been previously reported in  different racial/ethnic groups.   Two previous GWASes have  identified that  the  TTC39B   rs471364   $(P=3\times10^{\cdot10})$  ) [12]  and rs581080   $(P=3\times10^{.12})$  )  [13] SNPs were associated  

with serum HDL-C levels in the European population. Recently, we also showed that serum  HDL-C levels were different between the  rs581080CC and CG/GG genotypes   $(P^{\mathrm{~\,~}}=$    0.009). In healthy controls, the rs581080G  allele carriers had lower HDL-C levels than the  G allele non-carriers [18]. Hsieh et al. [32]  showed that  TTC39B  mRNA was highly  expressed in liver and small intestine of chowfed wild type (WT) mice and was reduced by  $>$     $90\%$   in   $T T C39B^{\scriptscriptstyle{\prime}}\!.$   mice. HDL-C levels were  increased by   ${\sim}22\%$   in chow-fed   $T T C39B^{\scriptscriptstyle{\prime}}$   mice  compared to WT while non-HDL-C and TG levels  were unchanged.   $T T C39B^{\scriptscriptstyle{\prime}}\!.$  mice challenged  with 3 weeks of the high fat/high cholesterol/ bile salt diet had a   $42\%$   increase in HDL-C levels, a  $45\%$   increase in ApoA1, the major protein  component of HDL particles, decreased very  low density lipoprotein /ch yl omicron cholesterol levels and no difference in plasma TG levels.  However, previous findings on the association  of the  TTC39B  SNPs with the alterations in  serum lipid levels are inconsistent. Dumitrescu  et al. [19] failed to replicate  TTC39B  rs471364  previously associated with HDL-C concentrations   $(P=3\times10^{\cdot10})$  ) by Kathiresan et al. [12]. In  the current study, we also failed to find a significant genetic effect of the   TTC39B  rs1407977  SNP  on serum HDL-C concentrations and other  serum lipid traits in the healthy controls. These  findings suggest that the increased CHD and IS  risk of  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP in our study  

The rs1407977T allele frequency was higher in  CHD   $(\mathtt{16.2\%})$   and IS   $(15.0\%)$   patients than in  controls   $9.8\%$  ,  $P<0.001)$  ). The T allele carriers  had higher risk of CHD   $(\mathsf{O R}=\bot728$  ,   $95\%$     ${\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{I}}\;=\;$    1.290-2.316,   $P<0.001)$  ) and IS   $(\mathsf{O R}=1.518$  ,   $95\%~{\sf C l}\,=\,1.182–2.116$  ,   $P=0.002)$   than the T  allele non-carriers after controlling for potential  con founders such as age, gender, BMI, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and blood  pressure.  

The genotypic and allelic distribution of the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP in different ethnic  groups is not well-known.  According to   the International 1000 Genomes data-base 

 (https://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/tools 

 /1000 genomes/), the C and T  allele  frequencies of the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP  were   $81.25\%$   and   $18.75\%$   in African Caribbeans in  Barbados (ACB);   $86.07\%$   and   $13.93\%$   in  Americans of African Ancestry in SW USA  (ASW);   $70.35\%$   and   $29.65\%$   in Bengali from  Bangladesh (BEB);   $93.01\%$   and   $6.99\%$   in  Chinese Dai in X is huang bann a, China (CDX);  and   $58.59\%$   and   $41.41\%$   in Utah Residents  (CEPA) with North and Western European  Ancestry (CEU), respectively. The CC, CT and TT  genotype  frequencies were   $37.2\%$  ,   $49.6\%$   and   $13.2\%$   in CEU;   $81.4\%$  ,   $17.4\%$   and   $1.2\%$   in  Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT);   $83.0\%$  ,   $17.0\%$    and 0 in Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB);  and   $75.9\%$  ,   $21.4\%$   and   $2.7\%$   in  Yoruba in  

population may not be induced by reducing  serum HDL-C levels.  

The exact mechanism of  the  TTC39B  rs14-  07977 SNP on the risk of CHD and IS is  unknown. Hsieh et al. [32] discovered that  the  TTC39B  promotes the ubiquitin ation and degradation of liver X receptor (LXR). Decreasing  the ubiquitin ation and increasing the abundance of endogenous LXR protein can activate  anti-a the rogen ic cholesterol removal while  inhibiting the lip o genesis that leads to steatosis. The LXR transcription factor remains a target of interest because of its anti-a the rogen ic,  cholesterol removal and anti-inflammatory  activities. Thus, by ameliorating cardiovascular  disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,  TTC39B  inhibition could offer a new therapeutic approach to tackle two globally prevalent  chronic diseases.  

Several potential limitations should be acknowledged in this study. Firstly, as compared with  many previous GWASes and replication studies, our sample size was relatively small. Thus,  larger samples in different populations are  needed to confirm our findings in the future  studies. Secondly, there were significant differences in the general characteristics and serum  lipid profiles between the CHD/IS patients and  control subjects. Although several con founders  such as sex, age, BMI, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and blood pressure have been  adjusted for the statistical analyses, we could  not completely eliminate the potential influences of these factors on the results. Thirdly, since  many CHD/IS patients were taking lipid-lowering drugs, it was inappropriate to analyze the  association of the SNP and serum lipid levels in  these patients. Finally, this study only detected  a  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP and its association  with the risk of CHD and IS; other genetic variants were not detected and analyzed together.  Thus, there are still many unmeasured environmental and genetic factors and their interac-tions.  

# Conclusions  

The results of the present study showed that  there was significant association between the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP and the risk of CHD  and IS. The  TTC39B  rs1407977T allele carriers  have higher risk for CHD and IS than the T allele  non-carriers. No significant association was  noted between the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP  and all seven serum lipid traits. These results  suggest that the association between the  TTC39B  rs1407977 SNP and the risk of CHD  and IS in our study population may not be  achieved by reducing serum HDL-C levels.
