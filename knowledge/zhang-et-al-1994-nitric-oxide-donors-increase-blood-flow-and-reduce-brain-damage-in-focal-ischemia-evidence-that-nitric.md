Summary: We studied whether administration of nitric  oxide (NO) donors reduces the ischemic damage resulting  from middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in sponta­ neously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In halothane­ anesthetized and ventilated SHRs, the MCA was oc­ cluded. CBF was monitored using a laser-Doppler flow­ meter. Three to five minutes after MCA occlusion, the  NO donors sodium nitro prussi de (SNP;   $3~\mathrm{\bfm}\mathrm{\bfg}/\mathrm{\bfk}\mathrm{\bfg}/\mathrm{\bfh})$   or 3- morpholino-syd non i mine (SIN 1;   $\mathbf{1.5{-}6\,\ m g/k g/h})$   were  administered into the carotid artery for   ${\bf60}\;\mathrm{min}$  . As a con­ trol, the effect of papaverine   $(3.6~\mathrm{m}\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{k}\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{h})$  , a va so dil at or  that acts independently of NO, was also studied. The  hypotension evoked by these agents was counteracted by  intravenous infusion of phenylephrine. At the end of the  infusion, rats were allowed to recover. Stroke size was  determined   $\mathbf{24}\,\mathbf{h}$   later in thionin-stained sections. In sham  occluded rats, SNP   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}\,=\,5)$  5), SIN 1   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}\,=\,5)$  5), and papav­ erine   $(\mathbf{n}=5)$  ) produced comparable increases in CBF   $\left(\mathbf{p}>\right.$    0.05 from vehicle). After MCA occlusion, SNP   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}\,=\,5)$  5)  and SIN 1   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}=5)$  5), but not papaverine   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}=5)$  5), enhanced  

Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous free radical gas  involved in a wide variety of biological processes  (Moncada,  1992).  In the systemic circulation, NO,  produced in endo the li al cells, regulates vascular re­ sistance and platelet aggregation (Moncada,  1992).  In the immune system, NO is responsible for the  the recovery of CBF   $(\mathtt{p}<\mathtt{0.05}$   from vehicle) and reduced  the size of the infarct by   $28\,\pm\,12$   and   $32\,\pm\,7\%$  , respec­ tively (mean  $\pm\;\pm{\bf S D}$  ;  $\mathtt{p<0.05}$   from vehicle). To determine  whether NO donors could act by inhibiting platelet aggre­ gation, we studied the effect of SNP on collagen-induced  platelet aggregation. Intra carotid administration of SNP   $(3{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{g}}/{\mathrm{kg}}/{\mathrm{h}}$   for   ${\bf60}\ {\bf m i n},$  ) did not affect platelet aggregation  to collagen, suggesting that the protective effect of NO  donors was not due to inhibition of platelet function. We  conclude that NO donors increase CBF to the ischemic  territory and reduce the tissue damage resulting from fo­ cal ischemia. The protective effect may result from an  increase in CBF to the ischemic territory, probably the  ischemic penumbra. These findings suggest that NO do­ nors may represent a new therapeutic strategy for the  management of acute stroke.

cyto toxicity of activated macrophages (Nathan and  Hibbs,  1991).  In the nervous system, neuronal NO  may act as a neurotransmitter (Dawson et  aI.,  1992)  and may participate in the regulation of the cerebral  circulation (Iadecola,  1993).  NO is synthesized  from L-arginine by the enzyme NO synthase, an  enzyme of which three isoforms have been thus far  identified (Moncada,  1992).  

Recent studies have suggested that NO may play  a role in the expression of cerebral ischemic dam­ age. Whether NO is beneficial or detrimental to the  ischemic tissue, however, has not been clearly es­ tablished. NO, a potent cerebro va so dil at or and in­ hibitor of platelet aggregation (for review see Ra­ domski et al.,  1991;  Iadecola,  1993),  may increase  CBF in the ischemic territory and ameliorate isch­ emic damage (Morikawa et aI.,   ${\bf1992}a,b$  ;  Zhang and  Iadecola,  1993a).  On the other hand, it is well es­ tablished that NO is cytotoxic (Nathan and Hibbs,  1991;  Dawson et aI.,  1992),  and some studies have  presented evidence that NO is a key factor in   $N\!.$  ­ methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated brain injury  and in ischemic neuronal death (Dawson et aI.,  1991;  Nowicki et aI.,  1991;  Buisson et aI.,  1992;  Nagafuji et aI.,  1992).  Therefore, the precise role of  NO in cerebral ischemia remains to be established.  To investigate further the role of NO in the mech­ anisms of cerebral ischemic damage, we studied  the effect of NO donors, agents that generate NO  (Feelisch,  1991),  on the magnitude of the brain dam­ age resulting from occlusion of the middle cerebral  artery (MCA) in rat. We found that administration  of NO donors improves CBF in the ischemia area  and reduces the size of the infarct. NO donors did  not affect platelet aggregation to collagen. These  findings indicate that NO is beneficial in the acute  phases of focal cerebral ischemia and raise the pos­ sibility that NO donors could be important in the  management of acute ischemic stroke.  

# METHODS  

Methods for MCA occlusion, recording and analysis of  the EEG, monitoring of CBF by laser-Doppler flowmetry  (LDF) , and determination of infarct size have been de­ scribed in detail in previous publications (Zhang and Ia­ decola, 1992,   $1993a\bar{,}b)$   and will only be summarized here.  

# General surgical procedures  

Studies were conducted on 57 male spontaneously hy­ pertensive rats (SHRs) (Harland) and 17 Sprague-Dawley  rats weighing   $\mathbf{300-400\g}$  . Animals were not fasted. Anes­ thesia was induced with halothane   $(5\%$   in   $100\%$   oxygen)  administered through a facial mask. When deeply anes­ thetized, rats were intubated trans orally as previously de­ scribed (Zhang and ladecola, 1993b). Briefly, the epiglot­ tis and vocal cords were visualized with the aid of a fi­ beroptic illuminator, and a polyethylene catheter   $(\mathbf{OD}\,2.8\$    mm) was gently advanced through the oral cavity into the  trachea. The left external carotid artery was cannulated  centripetal ly and the catheter advanced toward the ca­ rotid bifurcation and secured in place (Fig. O. The fem­ oral vessels were also cannulated (Zhang and ladecola,   $\mathbf{\boldsymbol{1993}}a)$  . Rats were placed on a stereo taxi c frame (Kopf)  and artificially ventilated with   $100\%$   oxygen by a mechan­ ical ventilator (Harvard Apparatus Rodent Respirator).  At this time, the halothane concentration was reduced to   $1.0\%$  . Ventilation with   $100\%\,0_{z}$   was used because in pre­ liminary studies it was found that hyperoxia facilitates the  recovery of the animals after extubation. The body tem­ perature was maintained at   $37\,\pm\,0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   by a thermostat i­ cally controlled infrared lamp connected to a rectal  probe. One of the femoral arterial catheters was used for  continuous recording of arterial pressure (AP), mean AP,  and heart rate. The other catheter was used for blood

sampling for measurement of   $\mathbf{P_{a}O_{2}}$  '   $\mathtt{P_{a}C O_{2}}$  '  and   $\mathbf{pH}$   by a  blood gas analyzer (Corning model 178).  

# Monitoring of CBF and EEG  

CBF was monitored in the cerebral cortex ips i lateral to  the occluded MCA using LDF (Vasamedic, BPM 403A)  (Zhang and ladecola,   $1993a,b)$  ). A small hole   $\mathbf{1-}2~\mathbf{mm}$  in  diameter was drilled with the assistance of a dissecting  scope at a site   $2.5{-}3~\mathrm{mm}$   lateral to the midline and   ${\bf4.2\ \pm}$   $\mathbf{0.7\,\bar{\mathbf{m}}m}$   rostral to the interaural line. This site was found  in preliminary studies to correspond to the region of the  cerebral cortex that is rescued from infarction (see fol­ lowing). The dura was left intact and the LDF probe (tip  diameter   ${\bf0.8\;m m})$  ) was positioned   $\mathbf{0.5\mm}$   above the dural  surface. The analog output of the flowmeter was fed into  a DC amplifier (Grass) and displayed on the polygraph.  The EEG was recorded mono polar ly from a stainless­ steel screw inserted through to the skull at a site   $2~\bf{m m}$    lateral to midline and  $1\,\mathbf{mm}$  rostral to the LDF probe. The  reference electrode was a clip attached to the scalp.  

# Occlusion of MCA and determination of  infarct volumes  

Procedures for proximal or distal MCA occlusion and  for determination of the infarct volume are identical to  those published previously (Zhang and Iadecola, 1992,   $1993a,b)$  , Briefly, for MCA occlusion a   $_{3\cdot}$   to   $\mathbf{4.mm}$  hole  was drilled at a site superior and lateral to the foramen  ovale to expose the proximal or distal portion of the  MCA. The MCA was elevated and cauterized either prox­ imal to the origin of the lent icu lost ria te branches or me­ dial to the inferior border of the inferior cerebral vein  (Fig. 1) (Zhang and Iadecola, 1992). Twenty-four hours  after MCA occlusion, rats were killed and their brains  were removed. The site of CBF recording was marked  and the brain was frozen in isopentane. Coronal sections  (thickness   $30~\ensuremath{\upmu\mathrm{m}})$   were serially cut in a cryostat, col­ lected at   $\mathbf{300-}\upmu\mathbf{m}$   intervals, and stained with thionin. In­ farct volume was determined using an image analyzer 

 (MCID; Imaging Research) as previously described 

 (Zhang and Iadecola, 1992,   $^{1993a,b)}$  .  

# Platelet aggregation studies  

Platelet aggregation was assessed ex vivo as previously  described (Rao et aI., 1983). Briefly, platelet-rich plasma  was obtained by cent ri fuga tion   $\mathbf{\lambda}(200\;g$  for   $20\;\mathbf{min}$   at room  temperature) of he par in i zed   $(12.5~\mathrm{U/ml})$   arterial blood.  Platelet aggregation was tested with a Chronolog Lumiag­ gregometer using collagen   $(10{\scriptstyle-20\,\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}})$   as an aggregating  agent.  

# Experimental protocol  

Effect of NO donors on focal ischemic damage.  SHRs  were surgically prepared and the MCA was exposed as  described. Arterial blood gases were adjusted so that ar­ terial   $\mathbf{P}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{o}_{2}$   was between 33 and   $\mathbf{38\m m\,\bar{H}g}$  (Tables 1 and  2). The stereo taxi c frame was rotated to place the animal  in a lateral position and the MCA occluded as described.  Occurrence of neo cortical ischemia was indicated by a  sudden drop in CBF associated with a more gradual re­ duction in the amplitude of the EEG. Three to five min­ utes after MCA occlusion, normal saline (vehicle), so­ dium nitro prussi de (SNP; Sigma;   $3~\mathrm{\bfm}\mathrm{\bfg}/\mathrm{\bfk}\mathrm{\bfg}/\mathrm{\bfh})$  , 3-morpho­ lino-syd non i mine (SIN 1; Cassella, AG;   $3\,\mathrm{\bf~m}\mathrm{\bfg}/\mathrm{\bf}\mathrm{\bfg}/\mathrm{\bf}\mathrm{\bfh})$   or  papaverine (Sigma;   $3.6~\mathrm{m}\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{k}\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{h})$   was infused into the ex­ ternal carotid catheter for   $1\,\mathbf{h}$   at a rate of   $1\,\mathbf{m}/\hbar$  . All drugs  were dissolved in saline and solutions were used fresh.  SNP and SIN 1 generate NO and are potent vas odi la tors  (Feelisch, 1991). The concentrations of SNP, SIN 1, and  papaverine were selected in preliminary studies so as to  elicit comparable increases in CBF when administered  into the carotid artery (Fig. 2). To counteract the hy­ potension associated with infusion of NO donors or pa, paverine, an intravenous infusion   $(0.5{-}1~\mathrm{{m}/\mathrm{{h}}})$   of phenyl­ ephrine (  $(10{-}100\ \upmu\mathrm{g/h})$   was also begun. In rats receiving  intra carotid infusion of vehicle, saline was administered  intravenously. Therefore, AP did not differ among ani­ mals receiving vehicle, NO donors, or papaverine (Tables  1 and 2). At the end of the infusion period, animals were  monitored to ensure that the AP was stable. Catheters  were then removed and wounds infiltrated with lidocaine  and sutured. Animals were allowed to recover and care­ fully observed during the postoperative period for the oc­ currence of seizures. Twenty-four hours later, rats were  killed for determination of infarct size.  

Several groups of SHRs with or without MCA occlu­ sion were studied (Tables 1 and 2). The first four groups  consisted of rats in which the MCA was exposed but not  occluded (sham occlusion). These animals received intra­ carotid infusion of vehicle   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}=5)$  5), SNP   $(3{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{g}}/{\mathrm{kg}}/{\mathrm{h}}$  ;   $\textbf{n}=$  5), SIN 1   $\mathbf{\{3\meg/k g/h}}$  ;  $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~\mathsf{~n~}~}}=\boldsymbol{5},$  5), or papaverine   $(3.6~\mathrm{m}\mathbf{g}/\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{h}$  ;   $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~\mathsf{~n~}~}}=\mathrm{~\mathsf{~5}~}$  5). In six groups of rats, the MCA was occluded  distally. These animals were treated with vehicle   $\left(\mathfrak{n}=6\right)$  6),  SNP   $(3{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{g}}/{\mathrm{kg}}/{\mathrm{h}}$  ;   $\mathfrak{n}=5,$  5), SIN 1 (  $\mathbf{1.5\mg/k g/h}$  ;   $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{n}}={\bf4}_{c}$  4), SIN  1   $(3\ {\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{g}}/{\mathrm{kg}}/{\mathrm{h}}$  ;   $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~\mathsf{~n~}~}}=~5.$  5), SIN 1   $\mathbf{\left(6~m g/k g/h\right)}$  ;   $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}\:=\:\pmb{4},$  4), or pa­ paverine   $(3.6~\mathrm{m}\mathbf{g}/\mathrm{k}\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{h}$  ;   ${\bf n}\,=\,5,$  5). In two additional groups,  the MCA was occluded proximal to the origin of the lentic u lost ria te branches. These animals received vehicle (n   $=4)$   or SNP   $(3{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{g}}/{\mathrm{kg}}/{\mathrm{h}}$  ;   $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}\,=\,4)$  4).  

Effect of nitro prussi de on platelet aggregation.  In  these experiments, the effect of intra carotid infusion of  SNP   $(3\,\mathrm{\meg/k\mathrm{g/h}})$   on platelet aggregation was studied.  Sprague-Dawley rats   $({\bf n}~=~5)$  5) were anesthetized with  halothane and surgically prepared for infusion of SNP  into the left carotid artery. Prior to the infusion of SNP, a  sample of arterial blood was collected   $(3\;\mathrm{{\bfm}l)}$  . The infusion  of SNP   $({\mathfrak{3}}{\mathrm{~m}}{\mathfrak{g}}/{\mathfrak{k}}{\mathfrak{g}}/{\mathfrak{h}})$   was then started. Phenylephrine was  coinfused intravenously to counteract the hypotension  elicited by SNP. One hour later, a second arterial blood  sample was collected and the SNP infusion was stopped.  Blood samples were then processed for platelet aggrega­ tion as described. In other experiments SNP (500-1,000   $\upmu M)$   was added directly to platelet-rich plasma from un­ treated donor rats   $\mathbf{(n_{\alpha}=\lambda3)}$  3) and platelet aggregation was  then tested.  

# Data analysis  

Data are expressed as means   $\pm\textit{\textbf{SD}}$  . Comparisons  among multiple groups were statistically evaluated by  analysis of variance and Tukey's test (Systat, Inc.). Dif­ ferences were considered significant for   $\mathbf{p<0.05}$  .  

# RESULTS  

Effects of NO donors on CBF in sham-occluded rats  In these experiments the effects of intra carotid  infusion of vehicle, SNP, SIN  1,  and papaverine  were established in animals in which the MCA was  exposed but not occluded (sham occlusion). In rats  receiving vehicle   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}=5)$  5), CBF was stable through­ out the period of infusion (Fig.  2).  Intra carotid in­ fusion of SNP   $(\mathtt{n}=5)$  , SIN  1   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}=5)$  , or papaverine   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}=5)$  5) produced comparable increases in CBF that  were sustained throughout the period of infusion   $(\,+\,192\,\pm\,64\%$   for SNP at   ${\bf60}\,\mathrm{min}$  ;   $\tt p<0.05$  , analysis  of variance). In these sham-occluded groups, a  small area of necrosis in the cortex adjacent to the  surgical site was observed   $\mathbf{24~h}$   later (Table  3).

# Effect of  NO  donors on recovery of CBF and on  infarct resulting from distal MCA occlusion  

In rats receiving vehicle   $\left(\mathfrak{n}=6\right)$  6),  distal occlusion  of the MCA resulted in an immediate drop in CBF   $(-77\pm11\%)$  .  Sixty minutes later, CBF recovered  by   $10\pm3\%$    (Fig.  3).  Twenty-four hours later, these  animals had large infarcts involving predominantly  the neocortex (Table  3;  Fig.  4).  The distribution of  the infarct was similar to that previously reported in  SHRs (Coyle,  1986).  

In rats in which the effect of SNP or SIN  1  was  studied, distal MCA occlusion resulted in an initial  reduction in CBF similar to that of the animals that  received vehicle   $\mathbf{\Delta}(\mathfrak{p}\;>\;\mathbf{0.1}$  ,  analysis of variance).  However, infusion of SNP   $(3{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{g}}/{\mathrm{kg}}/{\mathrm{h}}$  ;   $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~n~}}=\ 5)$  5)  or  SIN  1   $\mathbf{\{3\meg/k g/h}}$  ;  ${\bf n}={\bf5}$  5)  enhanced the recovery of  CBF substantially (Fig.  3;   ${\tt p}<{\tt0.05}$    from vehicle at

See Fig.  1  for details on the experimental pro­ tocol. Nitro prussi de, SIN  1,  or papaverine infusion resulted in  comparable increases in CBF that were sustained through­ out the period of infusion   $({\bf\dot{\rho}}\mathsf{<0.05}$    from vehicle, analysis of  variance and Tukey's test).  

20, 40,  and  $60\ \mathrm{min}$  ). These animals had a significant  reduction in stroke size at   $\mathbf{24\,h}$  . The reduction av­ eraged  $28\pm12\%$    for SNP and   $32\pm7\%$    for SIN  1 (3   $\mathbf{m}\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{kg}/\mathbf{h})$     $(\mathtt{p}<\mathtt{0.05}$    from vehicle; Table  3).  To de­ termine whether the reduction in stroke size was  related to the dose of SIN  1,  two additional concen­ trations were tested. The effect of SIN  1  was ap­ parent at a dose of   $1.5~\mathrm{{m}g/k g/h}$   (infarct reduction   $-\,11\,\pm\,8\%$ ;  $\textbf{n}=\textbf{4}$ 4;  $\tt p\,<\,0.05)$ . At  $3\ \mathrm{{m}g/k g/h}$  the reduction   $(\,-\,32\,\pm\,7\%)$  )  was not different from that  seen at  $\mathrm{6\,mg/kg/h\,(-\,32\pm11\%;p>0.05,n=5).}$  In  contrast to SNP and SIN  1,  infusion of papaverine   $(3.6\,\mathrm{mg/kg/h})$   did not affect CBF recovery or stroke  size   $\mathbf{(p>0.05}$    from vehicle; Table  3,  Figs.  3-5).  

The distribution of the cross-sectional area of the  infarct in rats receiving vehicle, SNP, SIN  1,  or  papaverine is illustrated in Figs.  4  and  5.  The tissue  retrieved from infarction by SIN  1   $(3{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{mg/kg/h}})$   was  located at all ros tro caudal levels (Figs.  4  and  5).  A  similar distribution was observed in rats in which  SNP was administered   $\mathbf{(p>0.05}$    from SIN  1)  (Fig.  4).  In contrast to SIN  1  and SNP, papaverine did  not affect the ros tro caudal distribution of the cross­ sectional area of the infarct   $\mathbf{(p>0.05}$    from vehicle)  (Figs.  4  and  5).  

To rule out the possibility that the reduction in  infarct size was a consequence of effects on plasma  glucose (Prado et  aI.,  1988),  we studied, in separate  SHRs   $(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{n}}=5)$  5),  whether infusion of SIN 1   $(3{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{g}}/{\mathrm{kg}}/$  h) modified plasma glucose. Mter MCA occlusion,  plasma glucose was   $217\,\pm\,29\ \mathrm{m}\mathbf{g}/\ensuremath{\mathsf{d}}\mathbf{l}$   before SIN  1  infusion and   ${\displaystyle267\,\pm\,33\;\mathrm{m}\mathbf{g}/\mathsf{d}\mathbf{l}}$   at the end of the infu­ sion   $(\mathfrak{n}=5$  5,   $\mathtt{p<0.05)}$  ).  The increase in plasma glu­ cose during SIN  1  administration is likely to be a  consequence of the phenylephrine infusion given to  prevent hypotension. These plasma glucose con­ cent rations are higher than those previously re

ported in SHRs (e.g., Morikawa et aI.,   $1992a)$  ). Dif­ ferences in the anesthesia protocol could perhaps  account for the discrepancy. In the study of  Morikawa et ai.  $(1992a)$  ), anesthesia was maintained  with halothane and   $70\%$   nitrous oxide, whereas in  the present study only halothane was used.  

To examine the possibility that the decrease in  infarct size produced by NO donors was a conse­ quence of a reduction in brain temperature  (Morikawa et aI., 1992c), the effect of intra carotid  infusion of SIN 1 on brain temperature was studied  in four intact Sprague-Dawley rats. Brain temper­ ature was measured using a thermal probe (diame­ ter  ${\bf0.6~mm}$  ) inserted into the body of the caudate  nucleus ips i lateral to the side of the infusion. Infu­ sion of SIN 1   $(3\ {\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{g}}/{\mathrm{kg}}/{\mathrm{h}})$   increased cortical CBF  but did not affect the temperature of the caudate  nucleus (before infusion:   $36.8\pm0.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ; during infu­ sion:   ${36.8\pm0.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}})$  ). Therefore, infusion of SIN 1 did  not result in brain hypothermia.

CBF recovery is pre­ sented as percentage of the initial reduction in CBF resulting  from MCA occlusion. The infusion of drugs was started   $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{S}}-{\bar{\mathfrak{s}}}$  min after MCA occlusion. Administration of nitro prussi de or  SIN  1  resulted in a significant improvement in the recovery of  CBF   $\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{\dot{\tau}}^{\star}\mathsf{p}<\mathsf{0.05}}\end{array}$    from vehicle, analysis of variance and Tukey's  test). In contrast, infusion of papaverine did not affect CBF  recovery   $(\mathsf{p}>\mathsf{0.05}$    from vehicle).  

# Relationship between location of CBF probe and  tissue retrieved from infarction  

The position of the laser-Doppler probe was his­ to logically verified in all rats so that the outcome of  the tissue in which CBF was recorded could be de­ termined. The distribution of the infarcted tissue in  reference to the location of the CBF probe in rep­ resent at ive cases is illustrated in Fig. 4. In rats re­ ceiving vehicle or papaverine, the probe was posi­ tioned over tissue that underwent infarction (Fig.  4).  In contrast, in animals that received SNP or SIN  1,  the tissue located under the probe did not un­ dergo infarction (Fig. 4). Therefore, the pattern of  CBF recovery observed with SNP and SIN 1 re­ flects that of the ischemic region that was rescued  from infarction.  

# Effect of SNP on ischemic damage after proximal  occlusion of MeA  

To determine whether the reduction in stroke size  afforded by NO donors was restricted to the cere­ bral cortex or could involve the striatum as well, the  effect of SNP on the stroke resulting from proximal  MCA occlusion was studied. Occlusion of the MCA  proximal to the lent icu lost ria te branches resulted in  infarction involving both neocortex and striatum  (Table 3). Administration of SNP   $(3\,\mathrm{\meg/kg/h)}$   re­ duced stroke size by  $19\pm4\%$   in the cortex   $(\mathtt{p}<\mathtt{0.05}$  from vehicle; Table 3), but did not affect stroke size  in striatum   $({\tt p}>{\tt0.05})$  ).  

# Effect of SNP on platelet aggregation  

NO is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation  (Radomski et aI., 1991). To determine whether the  reduction in stroke size exerted by NO donors was  due to the anti platelet effect of NO, we studied the  effect of SNP on platelet aggregation ex vivo. Infu­ sion of SNP   $(3{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{mg/kg}}/{\mathrm{h}})$   for   ${\bf60}\ {\bf m i n}$   in five rats did  not influence platelet aggregation (Fig. 6). In con­ trast, SNP   $(500{-}1,000~\mu M)$   added directly to plate­ let-rich plasma inhibited aggregation induced by  collagen   $(10{-}20\;\upmu\mathrm{g/ml})$  ) (Fig. 6). Therefore, infusions  of SNP at a concentration effective in reducing

FIG. 4.  Distribution of the cross-sectional area of the infarct resulting from distal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery  (MCA)  in animals receiving vehicle, sodium nitro prussi de, 3-morpholino-syd non i mine (SIN  1),  or papaverine. Infusion of nitro prussi de  or SIN  1,  but not papaverine, leads to smaller infarcts. The area rescued from infarction involves the dor some dial aspect of the  frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex. The arrows indicate the position of the laser-Doppler probe used to monitor  CBF  after  MCA  occlusion. In rats receiving vehicle or papaverine, the CBF probe overlies infarcted tissue, while in rats receiving nitro prussi de  or SIN  1,  the probe is located over tissue that did not undergo infarction. As illustrated in Fig. 3, infusion of nitro prussi de or SIN  1  enhanced the recovery of CBF in the tissue that was spared from infarction, while papaverine did not. The finding suggests that  nitric oxide donors increase CBF to the tissue that is rescued from infarction.

# DISCUSSION  

We have demonstrated that intra carotid adminis­ tration of SNP and SIN 1, potent vas odi la tors that  act by generating NO (Feelisch, 1991), reduces the  brain damage resulting from MCA occlusion in  SHRs. Administration of these agents increases  CBF in the tissue that is rescued from infarction. In  contrast, papaverine, a cerebro va so dil at or that acts  independently of NO (Iadecola, 1992a), fails to en­ hance CBF recovery or reduce infarct size. These  findings indicate that NO donors ameliorate the  functional impairment and tissue damage resulting  from focal cerebral ischemia.  

We have recently reported that administration of  SNP reduces the infarct resulting from MCA occlu­ sion in Sprague-Dawley rats (Zhang and Iadecola,  1993a). Although SNP is widely used as a NO donor  (Feelisch, 1991), this agent may have p harm a co log­ ical actions that are not related to NO production.  For example, SNP inhibits NMDA receptors by  producing ferro cyanide ions (Kiedrowski et al.,  1992). Furthermore, the va so dil at or effect of SNP  cannot be accounted for entirely by NO production  (Feelisch, 1991) . In the present study, we have  demonstrated that SIN 1, a more specific NO donor  (Feelisch, 1991; Manzoni et al., 1992), exerts a pro­ tective effect virtually identical to that of SNP.  These observations therefore provide stronger evi­ dence that NO is involved in the response. In addi­ tion, the results of the present study demonstrate  that the protective effect of NO donors is well pre­ served in SHRs. Since SHRs are more refractory  than Sprague-Dawley rats to treatments aimed at  reducing stroke size (e.g., Reis et aI., 1991), the  findings indicate that the protection afforded by NO  donors is indeed substantial.  

The effect of NO donors cannot be attributed to  differences in the physiological variables of the rats  because AP, blood gases, and body temperature  were carefully controlled and did not differ among  groups. The reduction in infarct size is unlikely to  be due to brain hypothermia (Morikawa et al.,   $\boldsymbol{1992c)}$   or to changes in plasma glucose (Prado et aI.,  1988) because (a) administration of NO donors does  not influence brain temperature and (b) NO donors  produce only a slight increase plasma glucose, a  change that cannot account for the protective ef­ fect. However, because brain temperature was not  monitored in experiments in which the MCA was

FIG. 6.  Effect of sodium nitro prussi de (SNP) on platelet ag­ gregation using collagen as an aggregating agent. Platelet  function was assessed ex vivo on platelet-rich plasma using  an ag greg o meter.  A:  Platelet aggregation was studied before  and after intra carotid administration of SNP   $({\mathfrak{z}}\,{\mathfrak{m}}{\mathfrak{g}}/{\mathfrak{k}}{\mathfrak{g}}/{\mathfrak{h}}$   for  1  h). SNP infusion did not inhibit platelet aggregation to col­ lagen   $(10\,\upmu\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{m}!)$  .  B:  In contrast, when SNP   $\left({\dot{\mathsf{I}}}\,{\mathsf{m}}{\dot{\pmb{w}}}\right)$   was added  directly to platelet-rich plasma of untreated donor rats, plate­ let aggregation to collagen   $({\bf20~{\upmu}g/m I})$   was blocked. The re­ sults suggest that SNP at doses that are effective in attenu­ ating the infarct resulting from middle cerebral artery occlu­ sion does not influence collagen-induced platelet  aggregation. However, SNP applied in large concentrations  to platelet-rich plasma inhibits platelet aggregation.  

occluded, the participation of brain hypothermia  cannot be completely ruled out. The reduction in  infarct size cannot result from the infusion of phen­ ylephrine needed to counteract the hypotension in­ duced by NO donors, because similar amounts of  phenylephrine were administered to rats that re­ ceived papaverine, a treatment that was not effec­ tive. Similarly, the reduction in the size of the in­ farct cannot be due to he mo dilution resulting from  the infusion of the drug because the total volume of  fluid administered was small and did not influence  arterial hematocrit or resting CBF. Although venti­ lation with   $100\%$     $\mathbf{O}_{2}$   and resulting hyperoxia could  have shortened the biological half-life of NO (Mon­ cada, 1992), the fact that NO donors produce va­ sodilation and reduce stroke size indicates that the  NO availability is sufficient for this agent to exert  its biological effects. It is therefore likely that the  attenuation of ischemic damage exerted by SNP or  SIN 1 is not an artifact of the experimental proce­ dure, but is due to an effect of these agents on isch­ emic damage.  

Several independent lines of evidence suggest  that NO is beneficial in the initial stages of cerebral  ischemia. First, administration of   $\mathbf{L}$  -arginine, the  precursor of NO (Moncada, 1992), increases CBF  to the ischemic territory and attenuates focal cere­ bral ischemic damage (Morikawa et aI.,   $1992a,b)$  .  Second, stimulation of the cerebellar fastigial nu­ cleus, a procedure that increases neo cortical CBF  by local release of NO (Iadecola, 1992b), improves  CBF in the ischemic tissue and attenuates the in­ farct after MCA occlusion (Zhang and Iadecola,  1993b). Third, tr an section of the parasympathetic  cerebro vascular fibers arising from the sphenopala­ tine ganglia, a nerve system that may synthesize  NO peri vascular ly (Toda and Okamura, 1990), en­ larges the size of the infarct resulting from MCA  occlusion (Kano et aI., 1991). Fourth, some labora­ tories, but not all (cf. Nowicki et aI., 1991; Buisson  et aI., 1992; Nagafuji et aI., 1993), have reported  that NO synthase inhibitors enlarge the size of the  infarct (Yamamoto et aI., 1992; Zhang and Iadecola,  1993a). Finally, the present study demonstrated  that NO-producing agents reduce focal ischemic  damage. Collectively, these observations indicate  that NO, either produced endogenous ly or admin­ istered exogenous ly, attenuates focal cerebral isch­ emic damage.  

An important question concerns the mechanisms  by which NO ameliorates the tissue damage result­ ing from focal ischemia. NO is a potent cerebrova­ sodilator (see Iadecola, 1993, for review) and, as  such, could enhance collateral flow in the ischemic  territory. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that NO donors increase CBF in the ischemic  tissue that is rescued from infarction. Thus, at vari­ ance with papaverine, NO increases CBF to the  ischemic territory and may prevent infarction of tis­ sue that is marginally perfused. NO could also re­ duce focal ischemic damage by inhibiting platelet  aggregation (Radomski et aI., 1991). Inhibition of  platelet function could prevent micro vascular oc­ clusion in regions of stasis and improve microvas­ cular flow. However, we have demonstrated that  SNP, at a dose that reduces stroke size, does not  affect platelet aggregation. This observation sug­ gests that SNP reduces stroke size without affecting  platelet function. However, the possibility that NO  inhibits platelet function in vivo at the microvascu­ lar level cannot be entirely ruled out on the basis of  our experiments because we tested platelet aggre­ gation ex vivo.  

Another potential mechanism by which NO could  ameliorate focal ischemic damage relates to the fact  that NO inhibits NMDA receptors (Manzoni et aI.,  1992). This agent, like other NMDA receptor antag­ onists, could reduce focal ischemic damage by  "protecting" the tissue from NMDA-mediated in­ jury (Choi, 1990). However, the effects of NO on  NMDA receptors and on NMDA-mediated neuro­ nal death remain highly controversial (see next  paragraph). Therefore, whether NO protects neu­ rons from ischemic damage by "cyto protective"  rather than "vascular-he mo dynamic" mechanisms  remains to be established. Whatever the mecha­ nisms of the protection, the brain tissue retrieved  from infarction is located between the ischemic  core and non ischemic tissue, a region correspond­ ing to the anatomical location of the so-called isch­ emic penumbra (Astrup et aI., 1981). Neurons in the  penumbra are electrically silent but are still able to  maintain ionic gradients and can regain function if  perfusion is restored (Astrup et aI., 1981). Thus,  NO may ameliorate ischemic damage by rescuing  the ischemic penumbra from infarction.  

NO is also a toxic substance (Nathan and Hibbs,  1991; Dawson et aI., 1992), and several studies have  suggested that this agent participates in NMDA­ mediated neuro toxicity and hypoxic-ischemic dam­ age (Dawson et aI., 1991; Nowicki et al., 1991; Buis­ son et aI., 1992; Nagafuji et aI., 1992). Thus, NO  may play both a beneficial and a deleterious role in  cerebral ischemic damage. This "double-edged"  role of NO is similar to that proposed for this agent  in other organ systems (Schmidt et aI.,  1992;  see  also Beckman, 1991). The mechanisms of the op­ posing effects of NO in cerebral ischemic damage  and their path o biological significance are unclear at  the present time. One hypothesis is the following:  

In the early phases after induction of ischemia, NO  could produce va so dilation, enhance collateral flow  to the penumbra, and limit the extent of tissue dam­ age. Mter several hours of ischemia, astrocytes be­ come reactive and activated macrophages and leu­ kocytes begin to accumulate in the ischemic terri­ tory (Garcia et aI., 1993). These cells are endowed  with an inducible isoform of NO synthase that, at  variance with the constitutive neuronal and endo­ thelial enzymes, is calcium independent and synthe­ sizes NO continuously (Nathan and Hibbs, 1991;  Murphy et aI., 1993). Large fluxes of NO produced  by these cells may aggravate the metabolic state of  the tissue and worsen ischemic damage. Therefore,  in the early stages after focal ischemia, NO may  have a beneficial effect, while at later times this  agent may be detrimental to the viability of the tis­ sue. This hypothesis, however, needs to be tested  experimentally.  

The finding that NO donors enhance blood flow  to the ischemic territory and attenuate focal isch­ emic damage suggests that these agents could be  used in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. One  potential problem with using these agents in stroke  patients is that they produce hypotension. In pa­ tients with myocardial infarction, a condition in  which NO donors appear to be beneficial, these he­ modynamic effects have been counteracted suc­ cessfully with va so constrictors (Nitz and Fiedler,  1987). A similar approach could be used in patients  with acute cerebral ischemia. NO donors may  therefore have a role in the management of cerebral  ischemia in the "hyperacute" phase. These agents  could be used in conjunction with other therapeutic  interventions, such as thr ombo lysis (Marshall and  Mohr, 1993), to limit the degree of ischemia.  

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that admin­ istration of NO donors after MCA occlusion im­ proves CBF in the ischemic territory and reduces  the tissue damage. The tissue rescued from infarc­ tion corresponds to the region in which NO donors  increase CBF, suggesting that these agents exert  their protective action by enhancing CBF to the  ischemic territory. This effect was shown to be in­ dependent of inhibition of platelet aggregation by  NO. The findings indicate that NO donors are ben­ eficial in the acute stages of focal cerebral ischemia  and raise the possibility that these agents could  have a role in the management of acute ischemic  stroke.
