Objective:   To  investigate  the  relationship  between  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) related to vitamin D (VitD) metabolism and post-stroke  depression (PSD) in patients with ischemic stroke.  

Methods:  A total of 210 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled at the  Department of Neurology in Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, from  July 2019 to August 2021. SNPs in the VitD metabolic pathway ( VDR ,  CYP2R1 ,  CYP24A1 , and  CYP27B1 ) were genotyped using the SNPscan ™  multiplex SNP  typing kit. Demographic and clinical data were collected using a standardized  questionnaire. Multiple genetic models including dominant, recessive, and overdominant models were utilized to analyze the associations between SNPs and  PSD.  

Results:  In the dominant, recessive, and over-dominant models, no significant  association was observed between the selected SNPs in the  CYP24A1  and  CYP2R1  genes and PSD. However, univariate and multivariate logistic regression  analysis revealed that the  CYP27B1  rs10877012   $\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{G}$   genotype was associated  with a decreased risk of PSD (OR: 0.41,   $95\%$   CI: 0.18–0.92,  $p{=}0.050$   and OR: 0.42,   $95\%$   CI: 0.18–0.98,   $p{=}0.040$  , respectively). Furthermore, haplotype association  analysis indicated that rs11568820-rs1544410-rs2228570-rs7975232-rs731236  CCGAA haplotype in the  VDR  gene was associated with a reduced risk of PSD  (OR: 0.14,   $95\%$   CI: 0.03–0.65,   $p{=}0.010)$  ), whereas no significant association was  observed between haplotypes in the  CYP2R1  and  CYP24A1  genes and PSD.  

Conclusion:  Our findings suggest that the polymorphisms of VitD metabolic  pathway genes  VDR  and  CYP27B1  may be associated with PSD in patients with  ischemic stroke.  

# Introduction  

Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a prevalent complication of stroke  events, affecting approximately one-third of stroke survivors at any  given time after a stroke. Individuals with PSD have a poor prognosis,  with prolonged hospital stays, impaired neurological recovery,  recurrent vascular events, poor quality of life, and increased mortality,  leading to serious negative consequences for individuals, families, and  society ( 1 ,  2 ). Identifying susceptibility factors for PSD is crucial.  Accumulating evidence suggests that PSD development is influenced  by various factors, including biological and psychosocial factors ( 2 ).  Additionally, genetic links have been established between PSD and the  apo lipoprotein  E  gene,  inflammatory  cytokine  genes,  methylene tetra hydro folate reductase gene, and brain-derived  neuro troph ic factor polymorphisms ( 3 – 6 ).  

Vitamin D (VitD) is involved in many of the physiological  activities of the brain, including the coordination of neuro troph ic  factors, immune regulation of the nervous system and neuro protection,  among other processes ( 7 ). During VitD metabolism, sunlight acts on  7-de hydro cholesterol in the skin epidermis, producing vitamin D3.  The liver primarily produces 25 (OH) D through hydroxyl ation by the  hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2R1. The second hydroxyl ation  to the active form 1,25 (OH)2D in the kidney is catalyzed by the  cytochrome P450 enzyme  CYP27B1  ( 8 ,  9 ). Most of the biological  effects of VitD are achieved through VDR-mediated regulation. VitD  binds to VDR and acts on target genes to regulate various metabolic  processes, cell adhesion, tissue differentiation, development, and  ang io genesis ( 10 – 12 ). Several studies have confirmed the association  of VitD levels with PSD development. For instance, Gu et al. found  that low serum VitD levels were independently associated with PSD  ( 13 ,  14 ), consistent with previous studies ( 15 – 17 ). Bahrami et al. also  suggested that genetic susceptibility accounts for a considerable  proportion of the heterogeneity in VitD levels ( 8 ). Hence, genetic  variations in the relevant genes may alter enzymatic activity in the  VitD metabolic pathway, leading to altered VitD concentrations.  

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the  association between VitD-related gene polymorphisms and  PSD. Given the crucial role that VitD plays in depression pathogen es is,  we selected SNP loci that may affect VitD metabolism, especially those  involving exonic and   $5^{\prime}$  -flanking regions. This study aimed to  investigate the association between selected SNPs in  VDR  (rs11568820,  rs1544410, rs2228570, rs7975232, rs731236),  CYP2R1  (rs12794714,  rs10741657, rs7129781),  CYP24A1  (rs2296241, rs2248137, rs2248359,  rs2762939, rs2296239, rs2274133),  CYP27B1  (rs10877012), and PSD  to identify genetic susceptibility loci for PSD and further explore  its pathogen es is.  

# Materials and methods  

# Participants  

We conducted a cross-sectional study at the Department of  Neurology in Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from July  2019 to August 2021. The study included patients who had  experienced an ischemic stroke. A standardized questionnaire was  used to collect patient demographic and clinical characteristics  such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertensive  disorders, diabetes, smoking habits, history of alcohol  consumption, and stroke location (anterior, posterior or both). Of  note, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was used  to quantify the cognitive status of the enrolled patients. The  Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD-17) is used to determine a  patient’s depressive status. The questionnaire was administered by  researchers who received uniform training. BMI was calculated by  dividing body weight (in kilograms) by the square of height (in  meters). PSD was defined as a HAMD-17 score of   ${>}7$   at 2 weeks  after stroke onset, and the scale’s reliability and validity in Chinese  populations have been previously demonstrated ( 18 – 20 ). Inclusion  criteria were: (1) patients not older than 80 years; (2) patients with  cerebral infarction onset within 14 days; (3) acute ischemic stroke  event confirmed by intra cranial CT or/and MRI; and (4) subjects  able to complete the scale assessment normally. Exclusion criteria  were: (1) difficulty in cooperating due to their understanding; (2)  presence of other depression-related neurological disorders,  including but not limited to Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body  dementia, multiple system atrophy; and (3) past diagnosis of  depression, bipolar disorder and other psychiatric disorders,  regardless of whether the subject is taking anti-anxiety or antidepressant medication.  

This study was approved by the Ethical Investigation and Review  Committee of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and written  informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal  guardians prior to enrollment.  

# Single nucleotide polymorphisms selection  and genotyping  

We have selected 15 SNPs (minor allele frequency  $>5\%$  ) from  the  VDR ,  CYP2R1 ,  CYP27B1 , and  CYP24A1  genes or their  expression that have previously been reported to be associated with  stroke or depression, based on the National Center for Biotechnology  Information SNP database 1  ( Supplementary Table S1 ). After an 8-h  fasting period,   $_{3-5\,\mathrm{mL}}$   of blood was collected from each subject  using ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) anti coagulation  tubes. The plasma and blood cells were separated by cent ri fuga tion  at a low temperature   $(4^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$   and stored separately at   $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until  DNA extraction. Genotyping was performed using the high  specificity of the ligase ligation reaction to identify alleles at the  SNP. This was followed by the introduction of non-specific sequences  of different lengths at the end of the ligation probe and by the ligase  addition reaction to obtain ligation products of different lengths  corresponding to the SNP, PCR amplification of the ligation products  using fluorescent ly labeled universal primers, and electro ph ore tic  separation of the amplified products by fluorescence capillary  electrophoresis. Raw data collected on the ABI3730XL sequencer  were analyzed using GeneMapper 4.1 software (Applied Bio systems,  USA). The SNPscan ™  multiplex SNP typing kit was used for  genotyping with technical support from the Center for Genetic and  Genomic Analysis, Genesky Bio technologies (Inc., Shanghai,  China). This technique has been previously reported in the literature  ( 21 ,  22 ). The quality control analysis included a random selection of  samples for reproducibility assessment and negative controls. Only  individuals with an SNP detection rate of   ${\tt>}99.5\%$   were included in  the final study.  

# Statistical analysis  

The statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 26.0,  R software version 4.2.1 with the gtsummary package version 1.6.2  and pwr package version 1.3.0. Continuous variables were presented  as mean  $\pm$   standard deviation (SD). Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium  was assessed using the chi-square test. Categorical variables and  genotype frequencies were analyzed using Pearson’s chi-square test  or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables that followed a normal  distribution were analyzed using Student’s  t -test, and those that did  not follow a normal distribution were analyzed using the Mann– Whitney   $U$   test. The risk assessment was performed using univariate  logistic regression models, with the odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$  confidence interval   $\it{5\%}$   CI) being reported as the outcome  measures. Entries with   $\boldsymbol{\mathit{p}}$  -values at borderline significance in the  univariate analysis   $(p\!<\!0.1)$   were included in the multivariate  logistic regression analysis. We investigated the gene-phenotype  associations using dominant, recessive, and over-dominant models.  The Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and haplotype analyses were  performed using SNPstat software ( 23 ). Power calculations for the  current study were performed using R software. A power value  greater than 0.8 was considered to indicate sufficient statistical  power. A   $\boldsymbol{\mathit{p}}$  -value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically  significant. Multiple comparisons were corrected by the simple  Bonferroni method ( 24 ,  25 ). The threshold of significance was set  at   $p\!<\!0.05/15\!=\!0.003$  , with   $p\!<\!0.05$   and   $p\!>\!0.003$   considered  nominally significant. For SNPs that reach significant or nominally  significant levels, we use the GWAS4D online tool for functional  annotation ( 26 ).  

# Results  

# Clinical features and statistical power  

A total of 210 patients in the acute phase of ischemic stroke were  ultimately included in this study.  Table 1  presents the baseline clinical  data between the PSD and non-post-stroke depression (NPSD)  groups. Of the participants, 109   $(51.9\%)$  ) were PSD and 101   $(48.1\%)$    were NPSD. There were more male patients in the NPSD group   $(52.4\%)$  ) compared to the PSD group   $(47.6\%)$  , while more female  patients were in the PSD group   $(61.5\%)$  ) compared to the NPSD group   $(38.5\%)$  ). Although the NPSD group had a higher proportion of  smokers and drinkers (53.0 and   $51.4\%$  , respectively) and the PSD  group had a higher proportion of patients with hypertension and  diabetes than the NPSD group (50.7 and   $61.9\%$  , respectively), these  demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ significantly  between the PSD and NPSD groups. Despite no significant difference  in stroke location between the two groups, the PSD group had lower  MMSE scores compared to the NPSD group (  $'23.82\pm4.54$   vs.   $25.46\pm4.33$  ,  $p\!=\!0.002\!,$  ). The calculated power value using the pwr  package of R software was 1, indicating sufficient statistical power in  our study.

The data are listed as the mean  $\pm\,\mathrm{SD}$   or numbers of patients when appropriate. Stroke  location represents either anterior or posterior circulation or both.  

# SNP’s characteristics  

All   $15\;\mathrm{{SNPS}}$   were found to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium   $(p\!>\!0.05)$  .  Table 2  presents the results of the analysis of genotype and  allele distribution, dominant, recessive, and over-dominant models for  all 15 SNPs. The study found no significant differences in the  genotypes and allele frequencies of the selected  VDR ,  CYP24A1 ,  CYP2R1 , and  CYP27B1  genes between the PSD and NPSD groups   $(p\!>\!0.05)$  . In addition, no significant differences were observed in the  three gene models for the  VDR ,  CYP24A1 , and  CYP2R1  genes  between the two groups. No significant differences were found in the  dominant and over-dominant models for rs10877012. However,  univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed a  protective effect of  CYP27B1  rs10877012 G/G compared to rs10877012  T/T-G/T for PSD in the recessive model (OR: 0.41,  $95\%$   CI: 0.18–0.92,   $\rho\!=\!0.030$   and OR: 0.42,  $95\%$   CI: 0.18–0.98,  $\scriptstyle{\dot{P}}\,=\,0.040$  , respectively). The  functional annotation analysis performed by GWAS4D revealed that  the  CYP27B1  rs10877012 variant is involved in encoding a transcript  intron ( Supplementary Table S2 ).  

# Haplotype association analysis  

In the  Supplementary materials , we presented the results of the  linkage d is equilibrium analysis in  Supplementary Table S3  and  Supplementary Figures S1, S2 . The haplotype analysis results were  provided in  Table 3  and  Supplementary Tables S4, S5 . Our analysis  indicates that the haplotypes of  CYP2R1  and  CYP24A1  genes are not  significantly associated with PSD. However, we observed a significant  association between the  VDR  rs11568820-rs1544410-rs2228570- rs7975232-rs731236 CCGAA haplotype and a reduced risk of PSD (OR:  0.14,  $95\%$   CI: 0.03–0.65,  $p\!=\!0.010$  ).

# Discussion  

To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first to 
 investigate the potential association between VitD-related gene  polymorphisms and PSD in the Chinese population with acute  ischemic stroke. We conducted multiple genetic models to analyze the  selected genetic polymorphisms of  CYP24A1 ,  CYP2R1 , and PSD, but  did not observe any significant association. However, we observed that  the  CYP27B1  rs10877012 G/G genotype was associated with a 
 reduced risk of PSD. Furthermore, we  found that the  rs11568820-rs1544410-rs2228570-rs7975232-rs731236  CCGAA  haplotype of the  VDR  gene was associated with a reduced risk of PSD,  indicating an 0.86-fold protective effect against PSD. These findings  provide important insights into the potential genetic risk factors for  PSD in stroke patients.  

Numerous studies have investigated the association between five  SNPs in the  VDR  gene and depression. For instance, Kuningas et al.  demonstrated that the  VDR  BsmI (C/T) and TaqI (A/G) genotypes  could influence cognitive function and depressive symptoms ( 27 ).  Similarly, other researchers have explored the role of TaqI, ApaI, and

Freq: haplotype frequency. Bolded means the value is significant.  \* Reference to rare haplotypes as there is no symbol to identify the group.  

BsmI polymorphisms of the  VDR  gene in different contexts. A study  analyzing 748 study participants found that TaqI  $\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{C}$   or  $\mathrm{C/T}$   genotype  was associated with emotional response and that patients with  autoimmune hepatitis carrying TaqI C/C, BsmI A/A, and ApaI A/A  had worse physical, social, emotional, and psychological functioning  ( 28 ). Another study of survival and health effects in people over  90 years old showed that carriers of  VDR  rs2228570 A/A and/or G/A  had little effect on longevity but may affect a variety of  path o physiologically relevant functions, including a significantly  lower prevalence of depression ( 29 ). However, some researchers have  reached opposing conclusions. For example, Groot et al. investigated  the association between VitD levels, selected VitD synthesis-related  genes, and depressive symptoms. They found that low serum 25 (OH)  D levels were associated with higher depressive symptom scores, but  no association was found between selected VitD loci and depression  ( 30 ). A matched case–control study conducted by Lye et al. in Kuala  Lumpur and Selangor included 600 participants genotyping three  adjacent SNPs (BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI) of the  VDR  gene. They found  no statistical association between the nine genotypes of BsmI, ApaI,  and TaqI and the risk of developing major depression, but the BsmIApaI-TaqI TAC (BAt) haplotype of the  VDR  gene increased  susceptibility to major depression ( 31 ). Our study also investigated the  association between  VDR  gene polymorphisms and PSD in a Chinese  acute ischemic stroke population. Interestingly, we found that the  CCGAA haplotype of the  VDR  gene was associated with a reduced  risk of PSD. It is important to note that the study by Lye et al. was  conducted in a major depression population, which is notably  inconsistent with a stroke population.  

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies  investigating the relationship between the  CYP2R1  gene and depression  in the context of acute ischaemic stroke. However, a meta-analysis  conducted in 2018 reported that the rs10741657 A/A genotype of the  CYP2R1  gene influences 25 (OH) D levels and is associated with VitD  deficiency ( 32 ). Previous genome-wide association studies have  identified a robust association between  CYP2R1  A/G and  CYP24A1 T/C genotypes and VitD levels ( 33 ). Adalı et al. found that genotype  frequencies and polymorphic allele frequencies of  CYP24A1  rs927650  and  CYP2R1  rs10741657 were not associated with ischaemic stroke risk  in the Turkish population ( 34 ). It is important to note that our study  did not find an association between the genotype and allele frequencies  of  CYP2R1  rs7129781, rs10741657, and rs12794714 and PSD in the  Chinese acute ischaemic stroke population. However, it should  be acknowledged that the association between  CYP2R1  and PSD in  patients with onset beyond 2 weeks still requires further clarification,  as our study did not conduct longer follow-up assessments.  

CYP24A1  is an important regulator of blood circulation and  intracellular VitD levels, playing a critical role in activating and  regulating various cellular pathways ( 10 ). The  CYP24A1  rs1570669  A/G genotype reduced susceptibility to ischemic stroke in both female  and male patients, while the rs2296241 A/G genotype reduced risk  only in male patients. Conversely, the rs6068816 T/C and rs2762934  A/G genotypes were associated with an increased risk of ischemic  stroke ( 35 ). Rats exhibiting depression-like symptoms demonstrated  increased expression of  CYP27B1 ,  CYP24A1  and VDR in the  hippocampus and elevated levels of 1,25 (OH)2D ( 36 ). However,  another animal study showed no change in  CYP27B1  and  CYP24A1   expression in the kidneys of depressed rats ( 37 ). In a post-mortem  study of suicide conducted by Postolache et al. increased expression  of the  VDR  gene and regular expression of the  CYP27B1  or  CYP24A1   genes were observed in the brains of depressed patients ( 38 ).  Unfortunately, our study did not reveal any statistical association  between the selected  CYP24A1  locus and the development of PSD,  suggesting that this relationship may need to be explored in future  studies with larger sample populations.  

CYP27B1 , which is essential for the VitD metabolic pathway,  serves as the 1- α -hydroxyl as e in humans ( 39 ). Although no studies  have investigated the relationship between  CYP27B1  and PSD, animal  studies have revealed that increased  CYP27B1  expression is associated  with depression ( 36 ). Moreover, previous research has demonstrated  that in activation or deletion of  CYP27B1  due to mutations causes  VitD-dependent rickets type 1 ( 10 ,  40 ). Fam et al. reported that the  CYP24A1  rs2762939 G/G genotype was significantly associated with  stroke-like vascular acute events, also known as acute coronary  syndrome, while the genotypes of  CYP24A1  rs4809960 and  CYP27B1 rs703842 were not associated with the incidence of acute coronary  syndrome ( 41 ). In our study, we  found a protective effect of the  CYP27B1  rs10877012 G/G genotype compared to the rs10877012  T/T-G/T genotypes in relation to PSD (OR: 0.41,  $95\%$   CI: 0.18–0.92,   $p\!=\!0.030)$  ), indicating that genes involved in the VitD metabolic  pathway may play a role in the development of PSD. Although the  functional annotation analysis suggests a potential association of the  CYP27B1  rs10877012 variant with encoding a transcript intron, the  underlying mechanisms of its impact on PSD remain unknown.  Further investigations using animal models will be  necessary to  explore the current findings.  

In addition, an authoritative meta-analysis showed that the  prevalence of early-onset PSD seems to be higher than the one-third  reported in most studies, at around  $48\%$   ( 42 ), which is consistent with  our study findings. We used HAMD-17 to identify PSD, while some  previous PSD studies have used DSM-5, the nine-item Patient Health  Questionnaire, the Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression  Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( 43 – 45 ).  Although these tools have been proven to be useful in stroke and are  suitable for interviewers to manage depression symptoms discovery  or screening tools in busy clinical environments, the heterogeneity  between different scales may have led to inconsistent prevalence rates  of post-stroke depression.  

Our study provides important insights into the genetic  pathogen es is of PSD by exploring the association between VitDrelated genes and PSD. However, there are several limitations that  need to be acknowledged. Firstly, the current study is limited by a  small sample size, which is partly due to the heavy clinical workload  during the COVID-19 pandemic and China’s zero-clearance policy,  which restricted the enrollment of additional eligible patients. Our  research, as a preliminary discovery, needs to be validated in a larger  sample size to confirm the reliability of our findings. Secondly, our  study was conducted primarily in the Chinese Han population, and  ethnic differences in PSD may limit the general iz ability of our results.  Research on other populations in the future remains necessary. Finally,  the occurrence of PSD is influenced by multiple factors, including  environmental factors, which were not comprehensively assessed in  our study. Therefore, further investigations are needed to examine the  role of environmental factors and their interactions with genetic  factors in the development of PSD.  

In conclusion, our study suggests that the  CYP27B1  rs10877012  G/G genotype may act as a genetic protective factor for PSD, while no  association was found between the selected  CYP24A1  and  CYP2R1   gene polymorphisms and PSD. Moreover, the  VDR  rs11568820- rs1544410-rs2228570-rs7975232-rs731236 CCGAA haplotype was  found to be associated with a reduced risk of PSD. These findings  indicate that the polymorphisms of VitD metabolic pathway genes  VDR  and  CYP27B1  may be involved in the development of PSD in the  Chinese ischemic stroke population. Further research is needed to  verify these findings.
