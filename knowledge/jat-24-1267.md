Aim : Stroke is associated closely with vascular homeostasis, and several complex processes and interacting pathways, which involve various genetic and environmental factors, contribute to the risk of  stroke. Although a dre nome dull in (ADM) has a number of physiological and va so protective functions, there are few studies of the ADM receptor system in humans. The ADM receptor comprises a  calcitonin-receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs). We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  RAMP2  and  CLR  genes to determine their  association with stroke in the light of gene-environment interactions. Methods : Using cross-sectional data from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study  in the baseline surveys, 14,087 participants from 12 research areas were genotyped. We conducted a  hypothesis-based association between stroke prevalence and SNPs in the  RAMP2  and  CLR  genes  based on data abstracted from two SNPs in  RAMP2  and 369 SNPs in  CLR . We selected five SNPs  from among the  CLR  variants (rs77035639, rs3815524, rs75380157, rs574603859, and rs147565266)  and one  RAMP2  SNP (rs753152), which were associated with stroke, for analysis. Results : Five of the SNPs (rs77035639, rs3815524, rs75380157, rs147565266, and rs753152) showed  no significant association with obesity, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, dys lipid emi a, and diabetes. In the logistic regression analysis, rs 574603859 had a lower odds ratio (0.238;   $95\%$   confidence  interval,   $\mathbf{0.07\bar{6}\!-\!0.74\bar{5}}$  , adjusted for age, sex, and research area) and the other SNPs had higher odds  ratios for association with stroke.  

Conclusions : This was the first study to investigate the relationships between ADM receptor genes  ( RAMP2  and  CLR ) and stroke in the light of gene-environment interactions in human.

# Introduction  

The vascular system plays a crucial role in organ  homeostasis, being essential for organ and tissue construction, the supply of oxygen and nutrients, and mobilization of inflammatory cells to regions of injury .  Current and novel therapeutic approaches aimed at  improving vascular function provide real benefits with  respect to reducing cerebro vascular disease 3) . In addition, the vascular system can be considered the largest  system in the body, given its length and area, and via  its active secretion of bioactive molecules, plays a central role in vascular homeostasis . Revealing the mechanisms underlying the functional integrity of the vascular system could lead to novel approaches to therapy  and preventive medicine.  

Strokes are associated closely with vascular homeostasis, and disruption of vascular function can also cause  a stroke. A stroke is the clinical culmination of several  complex processes and interacting pathways that involve  various genetic and environmental factors 7) . Genetic  contributions to strokes may result from common variants with small effect sizes, rare variants with large effect  sizes, or their combination 8) . However, environmental  risk factors are associated with the pathogen es is of  stroke, and considerable evidence suggests that geneenvironment interactions are important 9) .  

A dre nome dull in (ADM) is a vasoactive peptide first  identified in human phe och romo cyto ma 10) . Although  ADM is secreted by various organs and tissues, it is  produced mainly by vascular endo the li al cells and serves  a number of physiological functions . The ADM  receptor is a seven trans membrane domain G proteincoupled receptor, called the calcitonin-receptor-like  receptor (CLR) . The specificity of CLR for ADM  is thought to be regulated by receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), which are membrane proteins  having a single membrane-spanning domain. Analysis  of genetically engineered knockout mice revealed that  the ADM signal is indispensable for CLR and RAMP2  function . By contrast, there have been few studies  of the ADM receptor system in humans.  

The present study aimed to analyze  RAMP2  and  CLR  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and  evaluate their association with stroke in the light of  gene-environment interactions. This analysis was conducted as a cross-sectional study using a large-scale  pooled analysis of the Japanese general population.  

# Methods  

# Study Participants  

In the present study, we evaluated participant data  collected during the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study from the baseline surveys using the cross-sectional data. That cohort study  evaluated the general Japanese population in 12 research  areas, using genetic and clinical data to detect and confirm gene-environment interactions related to lifestyleassociated diseases 21) . The study participants were   $35\dot{-}69$    years old, and were enrolled after responding to study  announcements in their specific research areas, attending health check-up examinations that were commissioned by their local governments, visiting local health  check-up centers, or visiting a cancer hospital. A total  of 14,539 participants were selected. We analyzed the  data while minimizing the number of deleted participants. Each parameter was separated in the analysis  because of missing data.  

The J-MICC study participants included citizens,  health check examiners, and first-visit patients to a  cancer hospital. All participants in this study gave written informed consent. The study protocol was approved  by the Ethics Committees at Aichi Cancer Center, the  Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, and  other institutions participating in the J-MICC study.  The present study was conducted according to the  principles expressed in the World Medical Association  Declaration of Helsinki.  

# Lifestyle and Blood Biochemistry Data  

In the present study, we evaluated the lifestyle  and medical information obtained through self-administered questionnaires (alcohol consumption status, smok- ing habits, and physical exercise). The body mass index  (BMI) was calculated as weight   $(\mathrm{kg})$   divided by the  square of height   $\left(\operatorname{m}^{2}\right)$  . Obesity was defined as a BMI   $\geq\dot{2}5.0\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  . Alcohol consumption of each type of beverage was determined by the average number of drinks  per day, and then converted into the Japanese sake unit, 

 ‘gou’ (  $\mathrm{'180~mol)}$  , which is equivalent to   $^{23}\mathrm{\;g}$   of ethanol 

 (0,   $0.1\!-\!22.9$  ,   $23.0\!-\!45.9$  , or   $\geq46.0\,\mathrm{~g~}$   ethanol/day).  Regular physical activity was defined as three times a  week and lasting over 30 minutes. Anamnesis and  medication history were also assessed using a questionnaire. Information on stroke   $(n\!=\!248)$  ) and ischemic  heart disease   $(n\!=\!403)$  ) was available from the self-administered questionnaires. Hypertension was defined as a  systolic/diastolic blood pressure  $\geq140/90~\mathrm{mm~Hg}$   and/ or current use of medication for hypertension. Dyslipidemia was defined as non-high density lipoprotein-C   $(\mathrm{HDL-C})\geq170\ \mathrm{mg\dl^{-1}}$   and/or HDL $.C<\!40~\mathrm{mg}~\mathrm{d}\mathrm{l}^{-1}$  and/or current use of medication for dys lipid emi a. Diabetes was defined as a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)  level  $\geq6.5\%$   and/or current use of medication for diabetes. The participants who have the absence of laboratory data and/or insufficient data were excluded in  each analytic criterion.  

In addition, blood chemistry data (serum levels  of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, non-HDLC, creatinine, and HbA1c) and an thro po metric data  were obtained from health check-ups performed in  the research areas. The estimated glomerular filtration  rate (eGFR) was calculated using the following equation: eGFR   $(\mathrm{mL/min}/1.73~\mathrm{m^{2}})\,{=}\,\breve{1}94\,\times$  creatinine  $-1.0{\overset{\bullet}{9}}4\,\times$   $\mathrm{qge^{-0.287}}$   (for men) and eGFR   $\mathrm{(mL/min/1.73~m^{2})}\,{=}\,194$   

  $\times$  creatinine  ${\displaystyle-1.094\times\mathrm{age}^{-0.287}\times0.739}$   (for women) 22) . Each  blood sample was centrifuged and the plasma was separated and stored at  $-\,80\,\mathrm{\textbar{C}}$   until analysis. Laboratories  in each research area analyzed the serum samples.  

# Genotyping and Quality Control Filtering  

In the study, buffy coat fractions and DNA were  prepared from blood samples and stored at   $-\,80\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   at  the central J-MICC study office. DNA was extracted  from all buffy coat fractions using a BioRobot M48  Workstation (Qiagen Group, Tokyo, Japan) at the central study office. For the samples from two areas (Fukuoka and Kyushu-KOPS), DNA was extracted locally  from samples of whole blood, using an automatic nucleic  acid isolation system (NA-3000, Kurabo, Co., Ltd,  Osaka, Japan). The 14,539 study participants from  the 12 areas of the J-MICC study were genotyped at  RIKEN Center for Integrative Medicine using a HumanOmni Express Exo me-8 v1.2 BeadChip array (Illumina  Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Twenty-six samples with  inconsistent sex information between the questionnaire  and the estimate from the genotyping results were excluded. The identity-by-descent method implemented in  the PLINK 1.9 software  identified 388 closely related pairs (pi-hat  $\mathord{>}0.1875)$  ) and one sample of each pair  was excluded. Principal component analysis   $\mathrm{(PCA)}^{25}$    with the 1000 Genomes reference panel (phase 3) 27)   detected 34 subjects whose estimated ancestries were  outside of the Japanese population 28) . These 34 samples were excluded. All the remaining 14,091 samples  met a sample-wise genotype call rate criterion   $\left(\geq0.{\bar{9}}9\right)$  .  SNPs with a genotype call rate  $<\!0.98$   and/or a HardyWeinberg equilibrium exact test  $P\!\!\cdot\!\!\!\!\!\!\!.$  -value  $<1\times10^{-6}$   were  removed, resulting in   $^{873,254}$   autosomal variants.  Among these, 298,644 variants with a low minor allele  frequency (MAF)   $<0.01$   were excluded. This quality  control filtering resulted in 14,091 participants and  570,162 SNPs. After genotyping, data from four participants who withdrew from follow-up were excluded  from further analysis, resulting in 14,087 participants  were included in the analyses.  

# Genotype Imputation  

Genotype imputation was performed using SHA $\mathrm{PIT}^{29)}$   and Minimac3 30)  software based on the 1000  Genomes Project cosmopolitan reference panel (phase   $3)^{27)}$  . After the genotype imputation, variants with an   $\mathrm{R}^{2}$   value  $<\!0.3$   were excluded, resulting in 12,617,547  variants. We identified variants in the  RAMP2  and  CLR   loci, which identified two and 369 SNPs, respectively.  

# Statistical Analyses  

We compared the associations between various  genotypes and stroke, after combining the heterozygous  and minor homozygous alleles because of the small  number of minor homozygotes. We selected SNPs  from the  RAMP2  and   $C L R$   genes that exhibited a statistically significant association with stroke. Continuous variables are expressed as mean  $\pm$  standard deviation (SD) and categorical data are expressed as sums  and percentages. Inter-group comparisons were performed using Welch’s   $t$  -tests for continuous variables,  and the chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical  variables (sex, alcohol consumption, regular physical  activity, smoking, stroke, obesity, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, dys lipid emi a, and diabetes). The chisquare test was performed to examine the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for each locus studied. Odds ratios  (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression analyses, in which stroke  was defined as the dependent variable, and age, sex,  research area, alcohol intake, current smoking, regular  physical activity, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease, were included  as independent variables. The haplotype frequency and  linkage d is equilibrium of the SNPs were estimated using  Haploview 31) . All statistical tests were two-tailed, and  differences with a  $\mathcal{p}$  -value   $<\!0.05$   were considered statistically significant. SPSS software (version 18.0, SPSS,  Japan, Inc.) was used for all statistical analyses.  

# Results  

Among these 14,087 participants, the mean age  of the included 6337 men was 55.4 years, compared  to  $54.3$   years for the 7750 women.  

We identified two and 369 SNPs among the  genetic variants of  RAMP2  and  CLR , respectively  ( Supplementary Table 1 , Chromosomal locations were  described based on hg19/GRCh37 coordinates).  Supplementary Fig.1  shows the linkage d is equilibrium  analyses of 13  CLR  SNPs associated with stroke identified using the chi-square test. The position of the

studied SNPs in  CLR  is shown. Pair-wise SNP R-squared   $\mathrm{D^{\circ}}$   linkage values (multiplied by 100) are also  shown. We then selected five SNPs from among the  CLR  variants (rs77035639, rs3815524, rs75380157,  rs574603859, and rs147565266) to avoid similar haplotypes. Similarly,  RAMP2  SNP (rs753152), which is  associated with stroke, was selected for analysis. The  distributions of genotypes and alleles of the evaluated  SNPs are summarized in  Supplementary Table 2 .  Supplementary Fig.2  shows exons (shown as boxes)   $1\,{-}\,\bar{4}$   for  RAMP2 , and exons 1–15 for  CLR . For analysis, we compared the associations between genotypes  and stroke, after combining the heterozygous and  minor homozygous alleles because of the small number of minor homozygotes alleles.  

Table 1  shows the distribution of stroke for each  SNP. The major homozygotes had significantly higher  incidences of stroke compared with the heterozygotes  and minor homozygotes, except for rs 574603859. SNP  rs 574603859 showed an inverse ratio between major  homozygotes and the other genotypes.  Table 2  summarizes the baseline characteristics of the participants  divided into two groups, classified by major homozygous alleles versus heterozygous and minor homozygous alleles. None of the SNPs showed a constant tendency for these characteristics.  Table 3  shows the distribution of obesity, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, dys lipid emi a, and diabetes for each SNP. SNP  rs 574603859 was associated with a higher incidence  of obesity in the heterozygotes and minor homozy

gotes. SNP rs753152 was associated with a higher  incidence of diabetes in the heterozygotes and minor  homozygotes. The other four SNPs showed no significant association with these diseases.  

To determine the relationship of the SNPs with  stroke in consideration of environmental factors, a logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, research area,  alcohol intake, current smoking, regular physical activity,  obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dys lipid emi a, and ischemic heart disease was performed. For the logistic regression analysis, the major homozygous genotypes were  used as the reference group and the heterozygous and  minor homozygous genotypes were used as the exposed  group in the dominant model.  Table 4  shows model  Ⅰ   adjusted for basic characteristics (age, sex, research area),  model  Ⅱ  adjusted for lifestyle, and model  Ⅲ  adjusted  for anamnesis.  RAMP2  SNP rs753152 was associated  with a significantly higher OR in model  Ⅰ  (OR, 1.773;   $95\%$   CI,   $1.194\!-\!2.6{\breve{3}}4)$  . The  CLR  SNPs were associated with a significantly higher OR in model  Ⅰ  (OR,   $1.448\!-\!3.735)$  ) in participants with stroke, excluding  rs574603859. SNP rs574603859 had a lower OR in  model  Ⅰ  (OR, 0.238;  $95\%$   CI,  $0.076\!-\!0.745)$  ) between  major homozygotes and the others. The model  Ⅱ   results were similar to those for model  Ⅰ . In model  Ⅲ ,  rs 574603859 showed no significant OR. The lack of  statistical significance when adjusting for anamnesis  indicated that rs 574603859 has no strong effect on  the risk of stroke.

# Discussion  

There is considerable evidence to suggest that the  pathogen es is of stroke is affected by not only genetic  factors, but also environment interactions 9) . Previous  studies showed that a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, physical inactivity, diet, waist-to-hip  ratio, current smoking, cardiac causes, and alcohol  consumption were associated with risk of stroke .  There was a J-shaped association between high amounts  of alcohol and increased risk of both ischemic and  hemorrhagic stroke 34) . Therefore, we defined age, sex,  research area, alcohol consumption status, current smoking, regular physical activity, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dys lipid emi a, and ischemic heart disease as independent variables in the logistic regression analyses. To  the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to  investigate the relationships between  RAMP2  and  CLR   and stroke in the light of gene-environment interactions in humans.  

The pathogen es is of stroke is very complex and is  associated closely with vascular dysfunction and disruption. Indeed, similar to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress  might play important roles in increasing the risk of  stroke by promoting vascular dysfunction and platelet  hyperactivity 35) . A review study showed that ADM has  strong anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation activities 14) . Moreover, ADM acts via CLR/RAMP2 to prevent brain injury in both acute and chronic cerebral  ischemia 36) , and exerts crucial va so protective effects  following vascular injury 37) . The vascular ADM-CLR/ RAMP2 system is critical in the regulation of vascular  integrity, including the maintenance of vascular structure, and the regulation of ang io genesis and vasoprotection against vascular injury . Studying the ADMCLR/RAMP2 system should reveal the mechanisms  underlying the functional integrity of the vascular system, and could serve as the basis for novel approaches  to therapy and preventive medicine.  

RAMP expression is modulated by various agents  in cell culture and in animal models of human disease 38) . For example, marked changes induced in the  cardiovascular and renal systems provided evidence of  an important role for dynamic RAMP regulation in  those systems. Studies suggest that regulation of RAMPs  might modulate the path o physiology of conditions  linked to RAMP-interacting G protein-coupled receptors. For example, human SNP studies described the  relationship between  CLR  and essential hypertension  and primary angle closure glaucoma . Polymorphisms in the  ADM  gene have also been reported to  have a possible association with essential hypertension,  dys gly c emi a, and a dre nome dull in levels . Genetic  variants of the ADM-CLR/RAMP2 system might affect  vascular homeostasis and cerebro vascular/card i ovas cular disease. Several studies have revealed interactions of  SNPs with stroke . In these studies, the functional  genetic polymorphisms were located in the promoters,  which could cause differences in the plasma levels of  the encoded target protein; were located in coding  exons, leading to amino acid changes; or were located  in an intron. Although we demonstrated that an intronlocated SNP is not functional, it could have other  effects, such as influencing splicing or regulatory processes; for example, the binding of transcription factors to the gene. Furthermore, as a tag SNP, the polymorphism might be representative of many other variants, which could regulate the function of the receptor.  

The limitations of our study include its crosssectional design. However, case-control studies can be  used to assess previously identified candidate regions  and to determine target selections more precisely. In  general, strokes can be divided into three subtypes:  ischemic, lacunar, and hemorrhagic. In this study, we  did not investigate the subtypes of stroke because we  used a self-administered questionnaire to judge anamnesis. By contrast, a previous study reported that stroke  and myocardial infarct seem sensitive enough to use  self-administered questionnaire for judgment at baseline in Japanese cohort studies 50) . In a future (followup) survey, we plan to assess the participants by looking up the actual medical records; therefore, we expect  these additional data will lead to further detailed analysis of genetic variants of  ADM  receptor genes in  accordance with the stroke subtypes and card i ovas cular disease. In addition, we only assessed Japanese participants in the present study, and further studies in  other ethnic groups are needed to validate our findings.  

# Conclusions  

In conclusion, the association of the  RAMP2  and  CLR  genes with stroke in a Japanese cohort implicates  these genes in the pathogen es is of stroke, although  further investigation is required to confirm their associations. It will be interesting to determine whether  the polymorphisms of  RAMP2  and  CLR  are responsible for functional changes, and to reveal the underlying mechanism, given the potentially important role  that  ADM  receptor genes play in stroke and/or vascular fragility.
