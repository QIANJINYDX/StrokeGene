# ABSTRACT  

Aim: This study aimed to detect the association of the mevalonate kinase (MVK)  and methyl mal onic aciduria (cobalamin deficiency) cblB type (MMAB) gene variants,  their haplotypes, and gene-environment   $({\tt G}\times{\tt E})$   interactions on serum lipid levels and  the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke (IS) in a Chinese Han  population.  

Methods: Genotyping of the rs3759387, rs7134594, rs877710 and rs9593 SNPs  in 846 CHD and 869 IS patients and 847 healthy controls was performed by PCRRFLP and Sanger sequencing. Logistic regression and factor regression were used to  investigate the association of 4  MVK-MMAB  SNPs and serum lipid levels and the risk  of CHD and IS.  

Results: The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs3759387 and rs7134594  SNPs differed between controls and patients   $(P<0.0125–0.001)$  . The rs3759387 SNP  was associated with the risk of CHD and IS in different genetic models. The A-T-G-A  and C-T-C-T haplotypes were associated with increased risk of CHD. The haplotype of  A-T-G-A was associated with an increased risk of IS, whereas the C-T-G-A haplotype  was associated with a decreased risk of IS. Interactions of C-T-C-T-smoking or C-TC-T-age on the risk of CHD, and A-T-G-A-hypertension or A-T-G-A-age on the risk of  IS were also observed. The subjects with the rs 3759387 A A genotype in controls had  lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than did the subjects with  AC/CC genotypes. Several SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption and cigarette  smoking to increase serum HDL-C and apo lipoprotein A1 levels, but they interacted  with body mass index  $\geq24~\bf{k g}/\mathfrak{m}^{2}$   to decrease serum HDL-C and apo lipoprotein A1  levels.  

Conclusion: Several  MVK-MMAB  variants, especially the rs3759387 SNP, 4 main  haplotypes, and  ${\bf G}{\bf\times E}$   interactions were associated with serum lipid levels and the risk  of CHD and IS in a Chinese Han population.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke  (IS) are the most prevalent geriatric diseases and the major  determinant of mortality and morbidity worldwide [1- 3]. More than 700,000 people die from CHD each year  in China [4]. As a complex and multi factorial disorder,  CHD and IS are resulted from lots of pathogenic factors,  including genetic factors and environmental exposures  [5]. The major pathological basis of these two diseases  had proved to be atherosclerosis which the essential as  an ambitious in amma tory disorder. Therefore, both of  diseases would be participated in the same genetic and  environmental backgrounds, including gender, time to  life, hyper cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette  smoking, and genetic factors [6-9]. A large number  of genes and loci related to CHD [10] or IS [11] were  reported in previous genome-wide association studies  (GWASes). In addition, some genetic variants that were  initially shown to have an effect on the risk of CHD were  detected to be related to IS soon afterwards [12, 13].  

Recent GWASes have found several novel loci at  chromosome 12q24, including the mevalonate kinase  ( MVK ) and methyl mal onic aciduria (cobalamin deficiency)  cblB type ( MMAB ) genes, both of which inﬂuence highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [14, 15].  According to the relevant studies that this region can regulate  serum lipid concentrations. [16-18]. Particularly, two head  to head genes,  MVK  and  MMAB  took part in metabolic  pathways may adjust to HDL metabolism [19]. MVK,  encoded by  MVK , play an important role in an initial stage in  cholesterol biosynthesis. In humans, when  MVK  mutations  in homo zy gos it y can give rise to hyper immunoglobulin emi a  D syndrome, which the basic symptoms were fever and high  concentrations of immunoglobulins D and A in blood. When  the patients suffered from hyper immunoglobulin emi a D  syndrome, low HDL-C levels can be found, in accordance  with the latest GWASes ﬁndings [14, 15]. However, when  somebody lacked of cob (I) alamin a de no syl transfer as e,  as an enzyme encoded by  MMAB , may contribute to  methyl mal onic aciduria [20]. But, the exact metabolism  by which  MMAB  influences cholesterol is still unknown.  A relevant report about schizophrenia had revealed that  urinary methyl mal onic acid may negatively correlated with  red blood cell membrane cholesterol levels in blood [21].  MVK , which is close to  MMAB , gives rise to the increased  sensibility of obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis [22].  Therefore,  MVK  and  MMAB  may be appropriate candidates  as genes to elevate HDL-C concentrations and then affect the  risk of CHD and IS. Sun  et al.  had taken several SNPs into  consideration, including  MVK  (rs3759387 and rs2287218)  and  MMAB  (rs12817689, rs22411201, rs11067227,  rs7134594, rs877710, rs11067233, rs9593, rs11831226 and  rs8228), but only rs11067233 in  MMAB  may contribute to  the susceptibility of CHD by decreasing plasma HDL-C  levels in Han Chinese [23]. Junyent et  al.  suggested that the  MMAB -3U3527G/C variant might contribute to the variation  in HDL-C concentrations, particularly in subjects with high  carbohydrate intakes [24]. In the current study, we aimed  to detected whether four SNPs, rs3759387, rs7134594,  rs877710 and   $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}9593$   in the   $M V K$   and  MMAB  and their  mutual effect between gene and environment, make an  interaction with the risk of CHD and IS in Han populations  where located in southern China.  

# RESULTS  

# General features of the demography  

The general trait of the demography is summarized  in Table 1. The levels of systolic blood pressure  (SBP), pulse pressure, apo lipoprotein (Apo) B, and  the percentages of hypertension were higher but the  concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), the percentages  of individuals who consumed alcohol and the ApoA1 to  ApoB ratio were lower in persons who suffered from CHD  than in normals (  $P<0.05$   for all). The same situation was  also found in IS subjects compared to normals   $P<0.05$    for all).  

# Frequency of genotypes and alleles  

The frequency of genotypes and alleles of the  four  MVK-MMAB  SNPs is showed in Figure 1. Four of  the detected SNPs were conformed to Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium   $(P>0.05)$  ). The frequency of genotypes and  alleles of rs3759387 and rs7134594, but not rs877710 and  rs9593 SNPs, was distinguished normals from patients  (CHD and IS,   $P<0.05$   for all). The rs3759387A allele  and rs 3759387 A A genotype frequencies were higher in  CHD (A,   $14.70\%$  ; AA,   $1.89\%$  ) and IS (A,   $13.98\%$  ; AA,   $1.73\%$  ) patients than in control subjects (A,   $11.20\%$  ;  AA,   $0.95\%$  ;  $P<0.01$   for all). The rs7134594T allele and  rs 7134594 CT genotype frequencies were higher in CHD  (T,  $42.96\%$  ; CT,   $50.23\%$  ) and IS (T,  $41.60\%$  ; CT,  $47.3\%$  )  patients than in control subjects (T,   $41.14\%$  ; CT,  $45.45\%$  ;   $P<0.05$   for all).  

# Genotypes and the risk of diseases  

As presented in Table 2, in different genetic models,  after Bonferroni correction only genotypes of rs3759387 were  associated with the risk of CHD   $P\!<\!0.0125$   for 0.05 adjusted  for 4 variables was considered statistically signiﬁcant). The  dominant model: AA/AC  vs . CC   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.44$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=$  1.14–1.82,  $P=0.0023)$  ) and log-additive model: A  vs.  C (OR 

  $=1.42$  ,  $95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=1.15{-}1.77,$  ,  $P=0.0042)$  ) can be considered  as a statistically meaning. Similarly, dominant model: AA/ AC  vs.  CC (OR  $=1.32$  ,  $95\%$   $5\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.04{-}1.69,$  ,  $P\,{=}\,0.0018)$  ) and  log-additive model: A  vs.  C   $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.29$  ,  $95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=1.03{-}1.61$  ,   $P=0.0025\$  ) in genotypes of the rs3759387 SNP were also  increased the risk of IS.

# Interactions of the rs3759387 SNP and  environmental exposures on the risk of diseases  

As presented in Figure 2, the rs3759387 AA/AC  genotypes interacted with males resulted in increasing the  risk of CHD   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.08\$  ,  $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=1.55–2.77$  ,  $P<0.001\big>$  )  and alcohol drinking to reduce the risk of CHD   $\mathrm{{OR}=}$  0.66,  $95\%$   $5\%\,\mathrm{CI}=0.38–1.03$  ,  $P<0.001\big>$  ). The rs3759387 AA/ AC genotypes also interacted with males   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.76$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=1.31–2.38)$  ) and age  $>75$   years to increase the risk of  IS   $(\mathrm{OR}=4.99\$  ,  $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}=1.39–8.91$  ,  $P<0.001$  ).  

# Haplotypes and the risk of diseases  

Strong LD can be found among the rs3759387,  rs7134594, rs877710 and   $\mathrm{rs}9593$   SNPs in normals and  patients   $(D^{\prime}\,=\,\,0.92–0.99)$  ) (Supplementary Figure 1).  Besides, haplotype analyses which combined with the four  SNPs, and the associations of their different haplotypes  and the risk of diseases had also been carried out. The four  main haplotypes are presented in Table 3. The A-T-G-A  and C-T-C-T haplotypes were associated with an increased  risk of CHD (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}=1.43$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.14–1.81$  ,

The A-T-G-A haplotype was associated with  an increased risk of IS (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=1.28$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=$  1.01–1.63,   $P=0.041]$  ), but the C-T-G-A haplotype was  associated with a decreased risk of IS (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.83$  ,   $95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=0.69–0.99$  ,  $P=0.043]$  ).  

# The mutual effect between the haplotypes and  environmental exposures on the risk of diseases  

As shown in Figure 3, the interactions of the  MVKMMAB  haplotypes and several risk factors for CHD and IS  were noted in this study. The interactions of rs3759387Ars7134594T-rs877710G-rs9593A-smoking (adjusted OR

# Genotypes and serum lipid concentrations  

The association of the  MVK-MMAB  SNPs and serum  lipid concentrations in normals is shown in Figure 4.  There were distinct serum HDL-C concentrations among  the three genotypes of the rs3759387   $(P~=~0.008)$  ;  however, no positive findings were observed among

the other three SNPs (  $\textstyle P>0.0125$   for all). The subjects  with the rs 3759387 A A genotype had lower HDL-C  concentrations than did the individuals with rs 3759387 AC  and rs 3759387 CC genotypes. There were no differences  in serum TC, triglycerides (TG), LDL-C, ApoA1, ApoB  concentrations, and the ratio of ApoA1 to ApoB among  the three genotypes of the SNPs.  

# The interactions between the  MVK-MMAB  SNPs  and several environmental exposures on serum  lipid concentrations and the risk of diseases  

The interactions between the  MVK-MMAB  SNPs  and several environmental exposures, including alcohol  consumption, smoking, BMI, age, and sex, on serum  lipid levels and the risk of CHD and IS are revealed in  Table 4. The mutual effect between some SNPs and  alcohol consumption to add serum HDL-C (rs3759387,  Figure 5B; rs877710, Figure 5H; and rs9593, Figure 5I)  and ApoA1 (rs3759387, Figure 5C; rs7134594 Figure 5G)  levels. The mutual effect between rs3759387 (Figure 5A)  and rs7134594 (Figure 5F) and cigarette smoking to add  serum HDL-C concentrations. The mutual effect between  rs7134594 and   $\mathrm{BM}\geq24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$   to reduce serum HDL-C  (Figure 5E) concentrations. The mutual effect between  rs3759387 and   $\mathrm{BMI}\geq24\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$   to reduce serum ApoA1  (Figure 5D) concentrations.  

# Relative factors for serum lipid parameters  

As shown in Figure 6, Pearson correlation analysis  showed that several environmental exposures just as time  to life, sex, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption  and traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as BMI  and blood pressure levels, also correlated with serum lipid  phenotypes of the patient groups.

# DISCUSSION  

In the current study, we showed distinctions  between the frequency of genotypes and alleles of the  rs3759387 and rs7134594 SNPs between normals and  CHD or IS patients. Only the rs3759387 genotypes or  alleles were associated with the disease risk. In different  genetic model, the mutual effect between dominant  genotypes and males to add the risk of CHD, but they  interacted with alcohol drinking to reduce the risk of  CHD. Similarly, the dominant genotypes interacted with  males and age  $>75$   years to increase the risk of IS. The  SNPs of rs3759387, rs7134594, rs877710 and rs9593  were in strong LD in normals and patients. Four main  haplotypes were detected among the four SNPs. The  haplotypes of A-T-G-A and C-T-C-T were associated  with an added risk of CHD, but the haplotypes of C-TG-A and A-T-G-A were associated with an added risk  of IS. The individuals with the rs 3759387 A A genotype  in normals had lower HDL-C concentrations than did  the individuals with rs 3759387 AC/CC genotypes. The  mutual effect between several SNPs and alcohol drinking  to affect serum HDL-C (rs3759387, rs877710 and rs9593)  and ApoA1 (rs3759387 and rs7134594) levels. The mutual  effect between rs3759387 and rs7134594 and cigarette  smoking to influence serum HDL-C concentrations. Two  SNPs interacted with   $\mathrm{BMI}\geq24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$   to decrease serum  HDL-C (rs7134594) and ApoA1 (rs3759387) levels. The  interactions of haplotypes and several risk factors on  CHD and IS were also observed. Several environmental  exposures and traditional cardiovascular risk factors were  also correlated with serum lipid phenotypes in both patient  groups. As far as we had known that this is the ﬁrst report  to detect the interactions among the four  MVK-MMAB SNPs and their haplotypes and environmental exposures  on serum lipid concentrations and the risk of CHD and IS. We revealed that the frequency of rs3759387 and  rs7134594 genotypes and alleles were distinct from

At the same time, the patients with CHD  or IS had higher frequencies of the rs7134594T allele than  did the controls. The rs3759387 SNP was also associated  with the risk of CHD and IS after Bonferroni correction  in different genetic models and the mutual effect between  dominant genotypes and environmental exposures to  increase the risk of CHD and IS.  

In a previous GWAS, the information in the  International HapMap Project’s database showed  that the rs3759387A allelic frequency was   $23.3\%$   in  Europeans,   $17.8\%$   in Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB),   $9.9\%$   in Japanese, and   $45.1\%$   in Sub-Saharan African.  Besides, we also discovered that the rs3759387A allelic  frequency in our current research populations was lower  than in CHB in comparison with the other populations, a  reasonable explanation would be contributed to different  sample numbers and because of CHB in Guangxi are a  part of Han. Above results remind us that the prevalence  of the rs3759387A allele variation may have racial/ ethnic speciﬁcity. The prevalence of the rs3759387A  

allele is higher in Europeans than in Chinese. All of  these ﬁndings would be a reasonable explanation for  the distinct prevalence of CHD between European and  Chinese.  

The association of the rs3759387, rs7134594,  rs877710 and rs9593 SNPs and the risk of CHD and  IS has never been detected in previous studies. In the  current study, we revealed that the rs3759387 SNP may  have an association with the three SNPs and influence  the risk of CHD and IS. Furthermore, high LD among  the four SNPs was also found in controls and patients.  Moreover, when we analyzed the haplotypes among the  four SNPs, the haplotypes of A-T-G-A and C-T-C-T were  associated with an increased risk of CHD, whereas the  haplotypes of C-T-G-A and A-T-G-A were associated  with an increased risk of IS. However, these results  require further investigation in the different populations  with bigger sample numbers.  

Previous epidemiological researches have given  strong evidence that high serum HDL-C concentrations  would be inversed CHD morbidity and mortality [25- 27]. Each   $1\%$   decrease in LDL-C concentration has been  estimated to decrease the risk of CHD by   $1\%$   [28], and  each   $1\%$   increase in HDL-C level decreases the risk of  CHD by   $2\%$   [29]. The exact mechanism why HDL-C  can protection against atherosclerosis includes the below  three main points: (1), reverse cholesterol transport from  peripheral tissues to the liver [30]; (2), inhibition of  LDL-C oxidation; and (3), stabilization of the production  of prost a cyclin [31]. In humans,   $M V K$   and  MMAB  are  head-to-head orientation and located on chromosome  12. In addition,  $M V K$   and  MMAB , which share the same  promoter, are both modified by sterol-responsive elementbinding protein 2 ( SREBP2 ), which is a transcription  factor that controls cholesterol homeostasis. What is  more, the way in which these two neighboring genes

The differences in serum HDL-C and ApoA1  levels among the genotypes were assessed using analysis of covariance.

In contrast, when lacked  of cob (I) alamin a de no syl transfer as e, as an enzyme  encoded by  MMAB , someone may result to methyl mal onic  aciduria. The exact reason for  MMAB  adjusted cholesterol  metabolism has not been identified, maybe cholesterol  synthesis through  SREBP2  can explain our ﬁndings [33].  The precise mechanism of  MVK  and   $M M A B$   on serum  lipid metabolism remains to be investigated, which may  provide a promising target for medical therapy. Similarly,  little is known about the potential mutual effect between  the  MVK-MMAB  SNPs and their haplotypes with  environmental exposures on serum lipid levels and the  risk of CHD and IS. According to the current study, we  ﬁrst reported the mutual effect between some SNPs and  alcohol consumption to add serum HDL-C (rs3759387,  rs877710 and rs9593) and ApoA1 (rs3759387 and  rs7134594) levels. The mutual effect between rs3759387  and rs7134594 and cigarette smoking to add serum  HDL-C levels. The mutual effect between rs3759387 and  rs7134594 and alcohol consumption to add serum ApoA1  levels. The mutual effect between rs7134594 and  $\mathrm{BMI}\geq$   $24\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$   to reduce serum HDL-C concentrations.  

The rs3759387A-rs7134594T-rs877710G-rs9593A  and rs3759387C-rs7134594T-rs877710C-rs9593T haplotype carriers interacted with cigarette smoking and age  $>$    75 years to increase the risk of CHD. The rs3759387Crs7134594T-rs877710G-rs9593A  and  rs3759387A- rs7134594T-rs877710G-rs9593A  haplotype  carriers  interacted with hypertension and age   $>\ 75$   years to  increase the risk of IS.  

These findings may reveal a disadvantageous  effect of excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette  smoking on serum lipid information. The present study  has revealed that the mutual effect between rs7134594  CT genotypes and cigarette smoking to add serum  HDL-C levels. Additionally, the rs3759387 CC, rs877710  CG and rs9593 AT genotypes interacted with alcohol

consumption to increase serum HDL-C levels. Although  this is a contradictory ﬁnding and the exactly mechanism  is unknown, most smokers also get into habit of alcohol  consumption, which may be a proper explanation in our  study populations, and the potential interactions still need  to be further confirmed.  

A few potential limitations cannot be ignored. First,  compared to many GWASes and replication studies,  our sample numbers were relatively small. With these  situations, larger sample numbers are needed to determine  the consequences in future studies. Significant distinctions  from demography were observed between the normal and  patient groups. For the sake of statistical analysis accuracy,  we adjusted for several environmental exposures,  including time to life, sex, BMI, cigarette smoking, and  alcohol drinking, but the potential influence of these  factors on serum lipid concentrations and the risk of CHD  and IS could not be completely eliminated. In addition,  because many subjects were taking lipid-lowering drugs  treatments, it was not proper to analyze the association of  the four SNPs and serum lipid levels in the CHD and IS  groups.  

Last but not least, an individual’s genetic  background and various environmental exposures can give  rise to both CHD and IS, which are complex multi factorial  disorders. The association between four  MVK-MMAB SNPs and their haplotypes and the risk of CHD and IS  had been probed, but many aspects remain to be explored,  such as environmental exposures and genetic backgrounds  and their mutual effects.  

In conclusion, the consequences of the current  study showed that the frequency of genotypes and  alleles of the rs3759387 and rs7134594 SNPs was  distinct from normals and patients. The rs3759387  genotypes were associated with the risk of CHD and  IS in different genetic models. The rs3759387 SNP  interacted with males to increase the risk of CHD and  alcohol consumption to decrease the risk of CHD. The  same SNP interacted with males and age  $>75$   years to  increase the risk of IS. Four main haplotypes among the  rs3759387, rs7134594, rs877710, and rs9593 SNPs were  detected. The A-T-G-A and C-T-C-T haplotypes were  associated with an increased risk of CHD. The A-TG-A haplotype was associated with an increased risk

of IS, whereas the C-T-G-A haplotype was associated  with a decreased risk of IS. The A-T-G-A and C-T-C-T  haplotypes interacted with cigarette smoking and age  $>$  75 years to increase the risk of CHD. The C-T-G-A and  A-T-G-A haplotypes interacted with hypertension and  age  $>75$   years to increase the risk of IS.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Study patients  

Totally, 1715 unrelated patients were recruited  from the hospitalized patients who were treated in the  First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University.  Among them, 846 subjects suffered from CHD, and  another 869 patients were diagnosed with IS. CHD can  be defined as including typical ischemic symptoms, plus  one or more electrocardiograph ic changes (ST-segment  depression or elevation of   $\geq0.5~\mathrm{mm}$  , T-wave inversion  o  ${\mathrm{of}}\geq3\ {\mathrm{mm~in}}\geq3$   leads, or left bundle branch block), in  addition to increases in cardiac markers, such as creatinine  kinase-MB and troponin T. Coronary angiography was  carried out in patients with CHD. For the independent  ang io graph ers, two were blinded to the results of the  genotypes. When coronary angiograms were performed,  they were observed carefully. A vessel was chosen to  be scored, and stenosis   $\ge50\%$   had to be noted in an  epicardial coronary vessel of interest or in one of its major  branches. In the event of disc or dance of the number of  vessels scored between the two reviewers, angiograms  were scored by a third independent reviewer. The CHD  subjects could be chosen for to our study when signiﬁcant  coronary stenosis   $(\geq50\%)$   was observed in at least one of  the three main coronary arteries or their major branches  (branch diameter  $\geq2~\mathrm{mm}$  ). In addition, the ang io graphic  severity of disease was classiﬁed according to the number  of coronary vessels with signiﬁcant stenosis (luminal  narrowing  $\geq50\%$  ) as one-, two-, or three-vessel disease in  the three major coronary arteries [34, 35]. The definition  of IS was ensured in accordance with the TOAST (Trial  of   $\mathrm{Arg}\ 10172$   in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria [36]  after rigorous examination, including neurological test,  computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI). The IS patients entered in the study  included individuals who were eligible for one of the two  subtypes of TOAST criteria: large-artery atherosclerosis  and small-vessel occlusion. However, if the subjects had a  confirmed diagnosis of the below diseases, he/she must be  excluded from our study: a history of he mato logic or brain  MRI revealing cerebral hemorrhage, card i oem boli c stroke  or unspeciﬁed stroke, neoplastic or intra cranial space-occupying lesion, infection, other types of intra cranial  lesions, type 1 diabetes, and renal, liver, thyroid, and  autoimmune diseases. IS patients who had a past history  of CHD were excluded, as were CHD patients who had a  past history of IS.  

# Control subjects  

When CHD and IS patients were enrolled in  our study, 847 control subjects, who were matched by  age, gender, and ethnic group, were randomly selected  from healthy adults who underwent periodical medical  check-ups at the Physical Examination Center of the  First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University.  The controls were healthy, without any CHD and IS  details by questionnaires, history-taking, and clinical  examination. The examination must be covered lots of  items, just as physical examination, blood sampling,  electrocardiograph y,  chest  X-ray,  and  Doppler  echo car dio graph y. All enrolled individuals were Han  Chinese from Guangxi, the People’s Republic of China.  The relevant information was gathered by trained research  staff with standardized questionnaires for all participants,  including demography, socioeconomic status, medical  history and lifestyle exposures.  

This study was carried out following the rules of  the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 (http://www.wma.net/ en/30 publications/10policies/b3/), revised in 2008. The  study design was approved by the Ethics Committee of  the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University  (No: Lunshen-2011-KY-Guoji-001; Mar. 7, 2011). All  procedures were performed in accordance with ethical  standards. Informed consent was obtained from all  participants before data collection.  

# Biochemical measurements  

We received venous blood samples from all subjects  after at least   $12\,\textrm{h}$   of fasting. The enzymatic methods  with commercially available kits, including Tcho-1, TGLH (RANDOX Laboratories Ltd., Ardmore, Diamond  Road, Crumlin Co., Antrim, UK, BT29 4QY), Cholestest  N HDL, and Cholestest LDL (Daiichi Pure Chemicals  Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were used for detecting levels  of serum TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C, respectively,  in  samples.  However,  the  immuno turbid i metric  immuno as say (RANDOX Laboratories Ltd.) was needed  to explore serum ApoA1 and ApoB concentrations. All  determinations were performed with an auto analyzer  (Type 7170A; Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in the Clinical  Science Experiment Center of the First Afﬁliated Hospital,  Guangxi Medical University [37-48].  

# Statistical analyses  

The levels were 3.10–5.17 (TC), 0.56–1.70 (TG), 

 0.91–1.81 (HDL-C), 2.70–3.20 (LDL-C) mmol/L, 

 1.00–1.78 (ApoA1),   $0.63\mathrm{-}1.14~\mathrm{g/L}$   (ApoB), and   $1.00-$  2.50 (ApoA1/B), defined as the normal values [37-49].  According to WHO diagnostic criteria, Type 2 diabetes  should be defined as (1) fasting glucose   $(\mathrm{FPG})\,\geq\,7.0$    mmol/L, (2)   $^{\mathrm{~2~h~}}$   post pr an dial glucose   $\geq11.1\ \mathrm{mmol/L},$  ,  or (3) self-reported diagnosis of diabetes or use of antidiabetic medications [50, 51]. Individuals with   $\mathrm{TC}>$     $5.17\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$   and/or   $\Gamma\mathrm{G>}1.70\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$   were diagnosed  as hyper lipid emi c [52-54]. The 1999 World Health  Organization-International Society of Hypertension  Guidelines were used to define the management of  hypertension [55-57]. Normal weight, overweight, and  obesity were deﬁned as a BMI  $<24$  , 24-28, and  $>28~\mathrm{kg}/$   $\mathrm{m}^{2}$  , respectively [58, 59].  

# SNP selection and genotyping  

We selected four SNPs in  MVK/MMAB  with the  following steps. (1)  MVK  gene clusters, were selected from  a previous GWAS associated with lipid-metabolism.  MMAB gene clusters are found to be close to  MVK  gene clusters and  associated with serum lipid levels, especially HDL-C. (2)  Tagging SNPs were performed by Haploview (Broad Institute  of MIT and Harvard, USA, version 4.2), and functional  SNPs were predicted to lead to serum lipid changes from the  current version of the online resource (1000 Genome Project  Database). (3) SNPs information was obtained from NCBI  dbSNP Build 132 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/). (4)  SNPs were restricted to a minor allele frequency (MAF)   $>1\%$  . (5) SNPs might be associated with the serum lipid  levels or cardiovascular disease in recent studies. (6)  MVK rs3759587 and rs7134594 and  $M M A B\,\mathrm{rs}9593$   and rs877710  were selected by the block-based approach. This strategy  was enabled by the correlations between tagging SNPs  manifested as LD. Although classic tagging is not the goal  of SNP selection, with innovative tagging SNPs selection  bias is inevitable. [60-66]. Genomic DNA of the samples  was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes according  to the phenol-chloroform method [37-49]. Genotyping of 4  mutations was performed by PCR-RFLP and determined by  Sanger sequencing. The characteristics of each mutation and  the details of each primer pair, annealing temperature, and  length of the PCR products are summarized in Supplementary  Table 1 and Supplementary Figures 2 and 3. The PCR  products of the samples were sequenced with a sequencer  ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,  International Equipment Trading Ltd., Vernon Hills, IL, USA)  at Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology &  Services Co. Ltd., Shanghai China (Supplementary Figure 4).  

We employed the statistical software package  SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to analyze the  data. Quantitative variables are expressed as the means  $\pm$    standard deviation (because serum TG was not a normal  distribution, the levels are presented as medians and  interquartile ranges and were analyzed by WilcoxonMann-Whitney test). Qualitative variables are presented  as percentages. Allele frequency was determined via  direct counting, and the standard goodness-of-ﬁt test  was used to test Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. When  analyzing the difference in genotype distribution and sex  ratio between the groups, we used a chi-square analysis.  The general characteristics between patient and control  groups were tested by the Student’s unpaired   $t\cdot$  -test. The  association of genotypes and serum lipid parameters  was tested by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Any  variants associated with the serum lipid parameter at  a value of   $P<0.0125$   (corresponding to   $P<0.05$   after  adjusting for four independent tests by the Bonferroni  correction) were considered statistically signiﬁcant.  After adjusting for the age, gender, BMI, smoking, and  alcohol consumption, we employed unconditional logistic  regression to evaluate the correlation between the risk  of CHD and IS and genotypes. The same methods were  used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and  $95\%$   conﬁdence  interval   $95\%$   CI). When considering the interactions of  four SNPs with environment exposures, including alcohol  consumption, cigarette smoking,   $\mathrm{BMI}\geq24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  , age,  and sex, on serum lipid levels and the risk of CHD and  IS, we employed a factorial regression to analysis [67-71]  after controlling for potential con founders. A  $P_{\mathrm{I}}\,{\le}\,0.00125$    was considered statistically signiﬁcant after Bonferroni  correction (corresponding to  $P<0.05$   after adjusting for  five environment exposures multiplied by eight outcomes  by the Bonferroni correction). Haploview (Broad Institute  of MIT and Harvard, USA, version 4.2) analyzed the  haplotype frequencies and pairwise LD among the  detected SNPs. The heart-map of the inter-locus models  was measured by R software (version 3.3.0).
