Genet. 13:795479. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2022.795479Mendelian random iz ation was used to evaluate the potential causal association between N-terminal probrain na tr iure tic peptide (NT-proBNP) and ischemic stroke based on summary statistics data from large-scale genome-wide association studies. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs198389, rs13107325, and rs11105306 associated with NT-proBNP levels found in large general populations and in patients with acute heart disease were used as instrumental variables. The results of genetic association analysis of each single SNP show that there is no signi ﬁ cant association between NT-proBNP levels and ischemic stroke or its subtypes, whereas rs198389 alone has a suggestive association with large-artery atherosclerosis stroke. The MR analysis of three SNPs shows that NT-proBNP levels may reduce the risk of small-vessel occlusion stroke suggestively. This genetic analysis provides insights into the path o physiology and treatment of ischemic stroke.

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is the second major cause of global death with a mortality rate of approximately 5.5 million/ year and poses a huge  ﬁ nancial burden to family members and public health ( Donkor, 2018 ). The study of INTER STROKE presents 10 potentially modi ﬁ able risk factors that are associated with around   $90\%$   of acute strokes ( O ’ Donnell et al., 2016 ), and according to the data from the INTERHEART study, those factors also account for the great majority of the risk of myocardial infarction ( Yusuf et al., 2004 ). Therefore, it is generally acknowledged that a bidirectional interaction exists between brain damage and heart dysfunction ( Chen et al., 2017 ;  Scheitz et al., 2018 ), which may share overlapping cell death pathways ( Gonzales-Portillo et al., 2016 ).  

N-terminal probrain na tr iure tic peptide (NT-proBNP) is an N-terminal fragment of brain na tr iure tic peptide (BNP), released from the heart muscle in response to the blood pressure and volume overload ( Daniels and Maisel, 2007 ). This factor is widely used in the clinic as a prognostic biomarker to predict mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial  ﬁ brillation, and heart failure ( Johansson et al., 2016 ). Compared with BNP, NT-proBNP presents a longer circulating half-life, higher plasma concentration, and greater diagnostic sensitivity. Due to the connections between cardiac dysfunction and stroke, NTproBNP is supposed to be a potential predictor for the risk of ischemic stroke ( Zhao et al., 2020a ).  

The relationship between NT-proBNP and risks of stroke remains a popular research subject. The related research dates back to 1996 ( Rubattu et al., 1996 ). The scienti ﬁ c community has increasing interest in this area from 2010 ( García-Berrocoso et al., 2010 ;  Kim et al., 2010 ;  Quan et al., 2010 ) to 2020 ( Bhatia et al., 2020 ;  Harpaz et al., 2020 ;  Hotsuki et al., 2020 ;  Khan and Kamal, 2020 ;  Medranda et al., 2020 ;  Rubattu et al., 2020 ;  Shirotani et al., 2020 ;  Tonomura et al., 2020 ;  Wang et al., 2020 ;  Watson et al., 2020 ;  Yang et al., 2020 ;  Zhao et al., 2020b ). Several studies explore and identify variable degrees of correlation in different types of stroke. The data from the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study shows that NT-proBNP was associated positively with total stroke, non-lacunar ischemic, as well as card i oem boli c stroke, but not with lacunar or hemorrhagic stroke ( Folsom et al., 2013 ). NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of atrial  ﬁ brillation, which makes it a contributor to the incidence of card i oem boli c stroke ( Yang et al., 2014 ). A recent study indicates that serum levels of NTproBNP higher than   $800\,\mathrm{pg/ml}$   obtained within   $72\,\mathrm{h}$   after a transient ischemic attack were associated with an increased risk of stroke ( Rodríguez-Castro et al., 2020 ). More interestingly, in 2019, based on the Biomarkers for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe-Consortium, Castelnuovo et al. ( 2019 ) analyzed data of 58,173 participants free of stroke from six community-based cohort studies and found that, in the European group, levels of NT-proBNP have positive association with risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, independent from several other conditions and risk factors. These ﬁ ndings cannot be easily explained by the known physiological function of BNP.  

The role of NT-proBNP in the incidence of stroke became an unsolved question. A meta-analysis of 16 studies suggests that NT-proBNP provides minor clinical predictive values for the prediction of stroke mortality ( García-Berrocoso et al., 2013 ). According to the research of George et al. ( Gianna koul as et al., 2005 ), no signi ﬁ cant correlation was observed between NTproBNP levels and stroke severity or infarct volume. Another study also denied this association in terms of functional outcomes ( Etgen et al., 2005 ). Evidence suggests the causal relationships of na tr iure tic peptides to endo the li al permeability, which might predispose people to atherosclerosis and hemorrhages ( Lee et al., 2007 ;  Lin et al., 2007 ;  Kuhn, 2012 ;  Cannone et al., 2013 ). Therefore, some researchers hypothesized that NTproBNP may be involved in the causal physiological path for stroke incidence or be a causal risk factor of stroke ( Cushman

et al., 2014 ;  Di Castelnuovo et al., 2019 ). However, a large number of studies con ﬁ rms that BNP is a protective factor of CAD and a self-regulator of the body ’ s pathological state. The release of BNP improves myocardial relaxation and response to the acute increase of ventricular volume by opposing sodium retention, va so constriction, and anti diuretic effects of the activated reninangiotensin-aldo ster one system ( Daniels and Maisel, 2007 ). All of these  ﬁ ndings suggest that BNP may also have a protective role in stroke.  

As a result, available clinical observational studies investigating the association between NT-proBNP and risk of stroke show ambiguous results. The confounding factors of the observational studies may cause BNP levels to rise, but this increase is not one of the causes of stroke; and those studies cannot rule out some implicit risk factors of stroke.  

To circumvent the limitations of observational studies, Mendelian random iz ation (MR) analysis was used to improve causal inference. This technique is based on the premise that human genetic variants are randomly distributed among the population. This method may avoid the potential confounding factors within the exposure – outcome relationship and provide insight into the genetic association between the circulating NTproBNP levels and ischemic stroke ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, we conducted an MR analysis to investigate the causal effect of NTproBNP on ischemic stroke and its subtypes (car dio embolism stroke, small-vessel occlusion stroke, and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke) by using three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs198389, rs13107325, rs11105306) associated with NT-pro-BNP level ( Johansson et al., 2016 ).

Fields) ”  was searched in PubMed from 2005 to 2021, and the results showed a total of 34 articles ( Supplementary Appendix ). There are only  ﬁ ve studies that found SNPs associated with NTproBNP, of which the genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed by Johansson et al. ( 2016 ) was selected for our study (the retrieval process and inclusion/discharge criteria are shown in  Figure 2 ). This GWAS of 18,624 individuals with acute coronary syndrome consisting of   $99\%$   European and   $1\%$  African or Asian identi ﬁ ed two novel SNPs in SCL39A8

 (rs13107325, pooled    $p\,=\,5.99\,\times\,10^{-10}\rangle$  ) and POC1B/GALANT4

 (rs11105306, pooled  $p=1.02\times{10}^{-16})$   and con ﬁ rmed one SNP

 (rs198389, pooled  $p=1.07\times{{10}^{-15}})$  ) that were all associated with the serum level of NT-proBNP. Among these three BNPs, rs198389 is proven to be associated with the level of NTproBNP in several studies. The  ﬁ rst study of this SNP was reported in 2007. This GWAS surrounding the na tr iure tic peptide precursor B (NPPB) gene with plasma BNP levels was performed in 2,970 adults from the general population ( Takeishi et al., 2007 ). NPPB is on chromosome 1, encoding pre-proBNP. rs198389 is located in the NPPB promoter and has previously been found to in ﬂ uence promoter activity by interrupting an E-box consensus motif in the gene promoter ( Meirhaeghe et al., 2007 ;  Johansson et al., 2016 ). The rs13107325 is located in SLC39A8 on chromosome 4. It is a missense variant, which may cause an amino acid change at position 391 of the protein ( Johansson et al., 2016 ). This substitution is predicted to be deleterious to the protein ( Johansson et al., 2016 ). The rs11105306 is located in POC1B/GALANT4 on chromosome 12, which is in an intronic region with no obvious regulatory function ( Johansson et al., 2016 ).  

# Outcome Data  

The statistical data used for MR analysis of genetic associations with stroke was obtained from a multi-ancestry GWAS, including data from 521,612 individuals (67,162 cases and 454,450 controls) ( Malik et al., 2018 ). These participants were selected from 29 investigations, consisting of ancestry groups from European (40,585 cases and 406,111 controls), East Asian (17,369 cases and 28,195 controls), African (5,541 cases and 15,154 controls), Latin American (865 cases and 692 controls), mixed Asian (365 cases and 333 controls), and South Asian (2,437 cases and 6,707 controls) ( Malik et al., 2018 ). To avoid bias produced by a multiancestry population, we only used the data from the European group. The MEGASTROKE project was approved by relevant institutional review boards, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. The data set and basic information including sample size, age, and gender composition are presented in  Table 1 .  

# Statistical Analysis  

First, we conducted genetic association analysis to evaluate the association between single NT-proBNP-associated SNPs and

ischemic stroke and its three subtypes (car dio embolism, smallvessel occlusion, and large-artery atherosclerosis strokes). The signi ﬁ cance threshold is    $\textit{\textbf{p}}<\textit{\textbf{}}.005$  , considering that many association studies for a single test changed the  $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}$   value from .05 to .005, and the results with  $p$   values between .05 and .005 were considered to be suggestive of signi ﬁ cance. Second, we conducted the MR analysis using three MR methods, including inversevariance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger. IVW is the main MR analysis method, which combines the variant-speci ﬁ c Wald estimators by taking the inverse of their approximate variances as the corresponding weights ( Bowden et al., 2016 ). Weighted median could derive consistent estimates when up to   $50\%$   of instruments are not valid ( Bowden et al., 2016 ). MR-Egger could test the presence of potential pleiotropy and account for this potential pleiotropy using the MR-Egger intercept test ( Burgess and Thompson, 2017 ). The odds ratio (OR) as well as   $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval (CI) of stroke corresponds to about 1 standard deviation (SD) in NT-proBNP level. All the statistical tests were completed using R Packages “ Mendelian Random iz ation ” ( Yavorska and Burgess, 2017 ) and a    $\textit{p}<\,.0042$   (0.05/12 adjusted with Bonferroni method) was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant;  $p$   between .05 and .0042 were considered suggestive of signi ﬁ cance.  

# Results and Discussion  

The genetic association analysis evaluating the association between single NT-proBNP-associated SNPs and ischemic stroke and its three subtypes shows that neither of those SNPs have signi ﬁ cant association with ischemic stroke and subtypes, whereas only rs198389 has a suggestive association with LAS (  $95\%$   CI   $0.017{\sim}0.116$  ,    $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{p}}=$   .008686, .  $05>p>.005)$  ( Table 2 ). The MR analysis using three MR methods (IVW, weighted median, MR-Egger) shows no signi ﬁ cant causal association between BNP levels and the risk of ischemic stroke. However, the weighted median and the IVW present suggestive association in small-vessel occlusion stroke (SVS)

 (weighted median:   $\mathrm{{OR}=-0.268}$  ,   $95\%$   CI    $-0.492\!\sim\!-0.044,\,p$   $\begin{array}{r l}{\mathcal{P}=}\end{array}$  .019; IVW:   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,-0.199}$  ,   $95\%$   CI    $-0.389{\sim}{-}0.009$  ,  $\ensuremath{p}\ =\ .040)$  with no horizontal pleiotropy, which was identi ﬁ ed with the MR-egger method   $(p~=~.499)$   ( Table 3 ;  Figure 3 ). In conclusion, the genetic association analysis shows that rs198389 has a suggestive association with LAS, and the MR analysis shows that NT-proBNP levels suggestively reduce the risk of SVS.  

# Analysis of the Negative Results  

This MR study overcomes confounding risk factors and shows that there is no signi ﬁ cant causal association between BNP levels and the risk of ischemic stroke, which is contrary to the results of most previous prospective studies. The discrepancy therein may be ascribed to the negligence of some hidden risk factors for stroke, which may cause BNP levels to rise without any causal association with stroke. In 2013, in a random community-based sample, Cannone et al. found that rs5065 was associated with increased cardiovascular risk by analyzing the phenotype associated with atrial na tr iure tic peptide (ANP) genetic variant rs5065. The rs5065 is a genetic variant and its minor allele encodes for an ANP with two additional arginines at the C-terminus, ANP-RR. This research also found that the

endo the li al hyper permeability induced by chronic exposure to ANP-RR may predispose the subject to at hero sclerotic disease. Interestingly, the minor allele of rs5065 is associated with higher BNP plasma values. The researchers hypothesized that higher levels of BNP might be originated from the deleterious effects caused by ANP-RR on the heart although it did not reveal any other CAD signs ( Cannone et al., 2013 ). The rs5065 causes both ANP-RR and BNP levels to increase, but only ANP-RR is the causal factor. Pathways such as this may exist in the incidence of stroke and lead to controversial results. Although some evidence suggests causal relationship between na tr iure tic peptides and endo the li al permeability, which might predispose to atherosclerosis and hemorrhages, some research shows that BNP may also have anti-in ﬂ ammatory endo the li al actions ( Kuhn, 2012 ). These two actions are contrary to each other, which may explain the difference between the results mentioned above and our result.  

Possible Explanations of the Suggestive Associations The contradiction stated in the previous paragraph leads us to focus on the suggestive associations found in this study. The genetic association analysis shows that rs198389 alone has a suggestive association with LAS. The MR analysis shows that NT-proBNP levels have a suggestive positive causal effect on LAS in MR-Egger analysis   $\mathrm{(OR}=2.042$  ,   $95\%$   C  $\operatorname{I}0.263\substack{-3.821}$  ,  $\dot{p}=.024)$  ), but the MR-Egger intercept   $(95\%\mathrm{CI}-0.676{\sim}-0.066$  ,  $\textstyle p=.017)$   is signi ﬁ cantly different from zero, showing a pleiotropic effect on this outcome. The origin of loci may affect the results. In this study, the rs198389 locus came from a large population without special classi ﬁ cation, and the other two loci came from people with ACS in GWAS performed by Johansson et al. In our study, genes as instrumental variables need to be absolutely associated with exposure factors. However, the association between NTproBNP and the loci found in ACS patients is questionable. Therefore, we cannot conclude that NT-proBNP has no causal

relationship with stroke merely based on this study. We chose the GWAS performed by Johansson et al. as the SNPs source because it has the largest sample size among all of the available GWAS of NT-proBNP ( Figure 2 ). This is based on the idea that many of the current limitations of GWAS can be overcome to some extent by increasing sample sizes, which makes GWAS with larger sample sizes more reliable ( Tam et al., 2019 ). Therefore, GWAS of NTproBNP in general populations with a large sample size is anticipated to explore the relationship between SNP and stroke more accurately.  

Interestingly, in our study, it is also implied that the serum level of NT-proBNP suggestively reduces the risk of SVS. The role of BNP in lowering blood pressure may be involved in the mechanism behind this phenomenon. BNP is released from the heart muscle in response to blood pressure and volume overload. Its main effects are reducing the preload of the heart by promoting diuresis and capillary permeability, which results in the reduction of the blood pressure ( Goetze et al., 2020 ). In 2013, Wang et al. performed a retrospective study on the association between hypertension and different ischemic stroke subtypes, which involved 11,560 patients with ischemic stroke. The results show that hypertension is signi ﬁ cantly related to recurrent stroke in patients with SVS, but not other subtypes of ischemic stroke ( Wang et al., 2013 ). Taken together, we conclude that BNP can reduce the risk of SVS by lowering blood pressure. Whether BNP can reduce the risk of SVS needs to be veri ﬁ ed by more accurate and credible studies in the future, which will help us form a better understanding of the pathogen es is and treatment of SVS.  

# Strengths and Limitations  

Our MR study has several strengths. First, stroke is a complex disease with a large number of risk factors and path o physiological pathways. However, in this study, the relationship between NTproBNP and stroke was studied at the gene level with a large sample size and directly from the gene, which reduces the possibility of interference from implied risk factors. Second, in this study, the potential confounding factors caused by linkage d is equilibrium may be reduced by using three independent genetic variants as instrumental variables. Third, we selected three MR methods to enhance the robustness of estimates. Fourth, three-stage pleiotropy analysis were performed, which may decrease the risk of pleiotropy.  

Some limitations still exist in this MR analysis. First, the additional con founders cannot be completely ruled out as well as for the pleiotropy present in any MR study. Second, the obtained analysis results may be in ﬂ uenced by the population strati ﬁ cation, which cannot be fully ruled out. Third, the genetic relationship between NT-proBNP levels and stroke risk may be different in diverse genetic ancestries or ethnicities.  

This genetic association should be further evaluated in other ancestries. Fourth, a replication study should be performed to ensure the accuracy and rigor of our original study. However, the GWAS of stroke we used as outcome data had very large sample size. It conducted meta-analyses of 29 studies, which involved every large size of stroke-related database before 2018. As we know, there are no other relative studies that have approximately the same order of magnitude as the previous GWAS. Replication studies should be performed with another large GWAS of ischemic stroke.  

# CONCLUSION  

This research provides evidence that there is no causal relationship between elevated NT-proBNP level and the risk of stroke. It is ineffective to use NT-proBNP as the target for stroke treatment and prevention. NT-proBNP plays an important role in ischemic stroke, but its function is not completely clear, and its association with stroke needs to be further explored.
