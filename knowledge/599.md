ABSTRACT  Halo per idol is an effective antipsychotic agent, but it causes Parkinson ian-like extrapyramidal symptoms in the majority of treated subjects. To address this treatment-limiting toxicity, we analyzed a murine genetic model of halo per idol-induced toxicity (HIT). Analysis of a panel of consomic strains indicated that a genetic factor on chromosome 10 had a signi ﬁ cant effect on susceptibility to HIT. We analyzed a whole-genome SNP database to identify allelic variants that were uniquely present on chromosome 10 in the strain that was previously shown to exhibit the highest level of susceptibility to HIT. This analysis implicated allelic variation within pan te the in as e genes ( Vnn1  and  Vnn3 ), which we propose impaired the biosynthesis of cysteamine, could affect susceptibility to HIT. We demonstrate that administration of cystamine, which is rapidly metabolized to cysteamine, could completely prevent HIT in the murine model. Many of the halo per idol-induced gene expression changes in the striatum of the susceptible strain were reversed by cystamine coadministration. Since cystamine administration has previously been shown to have other neuro protective actions, we investigated whether cystamine administration could have a broader neuro protective effect. Cystamine administration caused a  $23\%$   reduction in infarct volume after experimentally induced cerebral ischemia. Characterization of this novel p harm a co genetic factor for HIT has identi ﬁ ed a new approach for preventing the treatment-limiting toxicity of an antipsychotic agent, which could also be used to reduce the extent of brain damage after stroke.  

KEYWORDS  p harm a co genetics; halo per idol toxicity  

H ALOPERIDOL is a potent D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) antagonist that is used to treat psychotic disorders (Beresford and Ward 1987). However, halo per idol-induced alterations in the extrapyramidal motor system depress the ability to initiate voluntary movements. As a consequence, characteristic extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which include tremors, Parkinson ian rigidity, and decreased spontaneous movement, develop in   $40–76\%$   of human subjects that are chronically treated with halo per idol (Parkes 1982;  

Soares-Weiser and Fernandez 2007). We recently analyzed a murine genetic model of halo per idol-induced toxicity (HIT) (Zheng  et al.  2015) in which the Parkinson ian-like symptoms developing in halo per idol-treated mice resemble those observed in drug-treated human patients (Crowley  et al. 2012a). The 27 inbred strains evaluated in this genetic model exhibit substantial variability in susceptibility to HIT (Crowley  et al.  2012b). For example, C57BL/6 mice are completely resistant, while A/J mice are highly susceptible to the Parkinson ian hypo kin es i a associated with HIT. We found that allelic differences in  Abcb5 , a member of the ABC-transporter gene family, affected susceptibility to this manifestation of HIT by regulating the level of halo per idol in the brain (Zheng  et al.  2015). This p harm a co genetic effect is of importance, since halo per idol is oxidative ly metabolized to a pyridinium species   $\left(\mathrm{HPP^{+}}\right)$   that is present in brain tissue of halo per idol-treated humans (Eyles  et al.  1997) and rodents (Igarashi  et al.  1995).   $\mathsf{H P P}^{+}$    is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I activity (Rollema  et al.  1994) and is toxic to dopamine r gic neurons (Bloomquist  et al.  1994; Rollema  et al.  1994; Eyles  et al.  1997).  

Given the extreme differences in the extent of HIT manifested by the inbred strains and the fact that  Abcb5 alleles only partially   $({\sim}33\%)$   account for their sus ce pti bility, it was likely that other genetic factors also affected this response. Since relatively little is known about the genetic mechanisms affecting susceptibility to drug-induced CNS toxicities, we comprehensively characterized the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to HIT. We identi ﬁ ed a second p harm a co genetic factor that affects susceptibility to HIT by inhibiting cysteamine biosynthesis. This genetic discovery enables a novel therapeutic approach for preventing HIT and possibly for reducing brain damage after ischemic injury.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Halo per idol studies  

All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the results are reported according to the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines (Kilkenny  et al.  2010). C57BL/6J, A/J, and all consomic mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were used at 15 weeks of age. Nineteen different consomic strains were evaluated, and each consomic strain is homosomic for a single speci ﬁ ed A/J chromosome on an otherwise C57BL/6 genetic background (Nadeau  et al. 2000). A halo per idol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis) stock solu- tion of   $1.0~\mathrm{m}g/\mathrm{m}l$   was made in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing   $10\%$   ethanol and   $0.5\%$   acetic acid, and the   $\mathrm{pH}$   was adjusted to 7.0, using sodium hydroxide. A cystamine di hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) stock solution of   $1\ \mathrm{mg/ml}$   was made in PBS. The mice were treated with halo per idol   $(10\mathrm{\,mg{\cdot}k g^{-1}{\cdot}d a y^{-1}\,i p}$  p) for 4 days and the extent of HIT was measured as previously described (Zheng  et al. 2015). Some mice were treated with cystamine (10  $\mathrm{m}\mathrm{g}{\cdot}\mathrm{k}\mathrm{g}^{-1}{\cdot}\mathrm{d}\mathrm{a}\mathrm{y}^{-1}\mathrm{~i}\mathrm{p}$  ) days before halo per idol treatment was initiated. The HPP   levels in brain, liver, and muscle were measured using the mass spectroscopy methods described in Zheng  et al.  (2015).  

# Microarray analysis  

Whole brain was collected 4 hr after the last drug dose and stored in RNAlater (Life Technologies, San Diego). Coronal blocks of striatum were micro dissected using a mouse brain slicer matrix (Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh). RNA was extracted from the striatal tissue, using an RNAeasy Plus Universal Kit (QIAGEN, San Diego), and stored at    $-80^{\circ}$   prior to analysis. Gene expression pro ﬁ ling of striatal tissue RNA was performed using Illumina (San Diego) Mouse WG-6  $\mathrm{v}2.0$   Expression BeadChips, and the arrays were processed at the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility. Raw microarray data of striatum samples from untreated C57BL/6J mice   $(n=3)$  , C57BL/6J mice treated with halo per idol   $(n=4)$  , untreated  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   mice   $(n=3)$  ),  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   mice treated with halo per idol   $(n=4)$  , and  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   mice treated with both halo per idol and cysteamine  $(n=4)$  ) were obtained. The raw expression intensities were processed and normalized among all the included arrays by the quantile-normalization method, using the LIMMA package (Smyth 2004) and R ( www.r-project.org ).  

Our goal was to identify genes that were differential ly altered by halo per idol treatment in  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   relative to C57BL/6 mice and whose response to halo per idol treatment was fully or partially reversed by co administration of cystamine. In other words, we performed a trend analysis to identify those genes whose expression levels displayed a correlation with the toxic effect of halo per idol and the protective effect of cystamine co administration.Afull-reversal pattern can be represented as a 0-1-0 pattern: the gene had a baseline expression level under the control condition, halo per idol treatment induced a change in the expression level, and cystamine co administration returned its expression back to the baseline level. Similarly, a partial-reversal trend can be represented as a 0-1-0.5 pattern. To identify these genes, two linear regression models with pre spec i ﬁ ed co variate s( i.e. ,  $0/1/0$  for baseline/halo per idol only/halo per idol co administered with cystamine, respectively, for the full-reversal scenario and   $0/1/0.5$   for the partialreversal scenario) were  ﬁ tted to the gene expression data. Since the linear regression models were applied to all the genes   $({\sim}25,\!000)$   present on the array simultaneously, an empirical Bayes method (Smyth 2004) was applied to obtain more robust estimation of the residual standard deviations, which was accomplished using the LIMMA package in R.  $P$  -values were then adjusted for multiple-testing correction, using the Benjamini – Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). Since expression changes in the brain were usually very small, none of the genes reached statistical signi ﬁ cance after multiple-testing correction. Therefore, we elected to  ﬁ lter the gene expression changes measured on the microarray by a two-step process. First, we analyzed the microarray data, using unadjusted  $P$  -values. Then, RT-PCR results were used to rigorously con ﬁ rm whether the genes identi ﬁ ed were indeed differential ly expressed. This twostep approach was employed because application of a multiple-testing correction for microarray data (25,000 gene probes) would be overly conservative sand would falsely remove genes that were truly differential ly expressed. Genes with an absolute fold change  ${>}1.5$  -fold (halo per idol  vs.  control) and an unadjusted  $P$  -value    ${<}0.1$   were identi ﬁ ed as diffe rent i ally expressed in each of the models. Then, the genes identi ﬁ ed by either model were combined into a single list that contained the genes whose expression was altered by halo per idol treatment, which was reversed by cysteamine treatment (Supplemental Material,  Table S2 ). Second, since  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   and C57BL/6 mice had different responses to halo per idol treatment, we sought to identify genes that were differential ly

Gene expression changes were measured using micro arrays in striatal tissue obtained from A/J or C57BL/6 mice after treatment with halo per idol  $(10\ \mathsf{m g}{\cdot}\mathsf{k g}^{-1}{\cdot}\mathsf{d a y}^{-1}\times4$   days) or from A/J mice treated with cysteamine   $(10\mathsf{\m g}{\cdot}\mathsf{k g}^{-1}{\cdot}\mathsf{d a y}^{-1})$   for 3 days before and during a 4-day period of halo per idol   $(10\mathsf{\mcong}\mathsf{k g}^{-1}{\cdot}\mathsf{d a y}^{-1})$  ) treatment. The 32 genes whose level of mRNA expression in striatal tissue was altered by halop idol treatment in A/J (but not   ${\mathsf{C}}57{\mathsf{B}}{\mathsf{L}}/6)$   mice and was reversed by cystamine treatment are shown. The fold change (FC) and unadjusted  P -value for the indicated comparisons are shown. A minus   $(-)$   indicates that the mRNA level was decreased by halo per idol treatment. hal, halo per idol; ctrl, control; cys, cysteamine.  

induced by halo per idol treatment in  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$  , but not in C57BL/6 mice. This was accomplished by  ﬁ tting the expression data to an ANOVA model, which contained an interaction term (expression  $\sim$   strain   $^+$   treatment   $^+$   strain \* treatment). When this ANOVA model was  ﬁ tted to genes whose expression levels were differential ly induced by halo per idol in A/J relative to C57BL/6 mice, the interaction effect was expected to be large and signi ﬁ cant. We then evaluated the ANOVA model for the    ${\sim}25{,}000$   genes on the array simultaneously and applied the empirical Bayes method to obtain a more robust estimation of the residual standard deviations, using the LIMMA package as described above. Next, the subset of these genes with a signi ﬁ cant interaction effect (strain \* treatment) was identi ﬁ ed. Genes with an absolute fold change  ${>}1.5$   in

  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   relative to C57BL/6 striatum and unadjusted    $P$  -value

  ${<}0.1$   were identi ﬁ ed as the genes whose expression was altered by halo per idol in a strain-speci ﬁ c manner ( Table S3 ). The genes common to both lists ( Table S1  and  Table S2 ) were identi ﬁ ed (Table 1). These genes, along with their fold change values (halo per idol treated  vs.  control A/J mice), were then analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software package (QIAGEN) for functional enrichment analysis.  

# RT-PCR analysis  

The level of striatal expression for nine of the genes in Table 1, which were selected because they exhibited the highest level of halo per idol-induced differential expression, was analyzed by RT-PCR. This two-step procedure was performed using the SuperScript III  ﬁ rst-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR and the SYBR Select Master Mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions. The level of expression of Hprt  was used as the internal standard for normalization. The primer sets used for ampli ﬁ cation are shown below:  

For analysis of  Vnn1  and  Vnn3  hepatic mRNA expression, RNA was extracted from the livers of adult male C57/BL6  $(n\,=\,2)$   and   $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$     $(n\,=\,2)$  ) mice, using an RNeasy mini kit

 (QIAGEN). Total cDNA was synthesized as described above, and Vnn1 and Vnn3 mRNAs were ampli ﬁ ed using the following

primer sets: CC AT CT AT GT TG TG GC GAA C(forward) and CC AT GAA A AT GT TTT GC TT AT GG (reverse) for  Vnn1  and T GG GC AGT GAG TTT T GTC TTC(forward) and AATGATATGT GC A CCC T GTC TG (reverse) for  Vnn3 .  Hprt  mRNA was used as the internal standard and was ampli ﬁ ed using the following primer pairs: TC A GTC AAC GG GG GAC AT AAA (forward) and GG GG CT GT ACT GC TT A ACCA G (reverse). Real-time PCR quanti ﬁ cation was measured on a 7500 Real Time PCR System (ABI). The relative mRNA level was expressed as fold change normalized against the average  D Ct  of  Vnn1  mRNA relative to  Hprt  mRNA in C57/BL6 liver.  

# Focal cerebral ischemia  

These experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. Male  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   mice at 16 weeks of age were used in these experiments. The mice were treated with cystamine   $(10\mathrm{\m}g{\cdot}\mathrm{k}g^{-1}{\cdot}\mathrm{day}^{-1}$    ip) or saline for 4 days, and one additional dose of cystamine (or saline) was administered  $3\;\mathrm{hr}$   prior to induction of cerebral ischemia, using pre- viously described methods (Zhao  et al.  2004). In brief, the mice were anesthetized with iso ﬂ urane, the left temporalis muscle was bisected through a scalp incision, and a  $\mathrm{2-mm}$  burr hole was made at the junction of the zygomatic arch and squamous bone. The distal middle cerebral artery was exposed and cauterized above the rhinal  ﬁ ssure. The incision was then closed,   $100\;\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of  $0.5\%$   bu piva caine was subcutaneously injected, and the mouse was allowed to recover.  

# Infarct size measurement  

Mice were killed by iso ﬂ urane overdose   $24~\mathrm{hr}$   after cerebral ischemia was induced. The brains were removed, and coronal sections were prepared at   $\mathrm{2-mm}$   intervals to generate four slices, which were stained with a  $2\%$   solution of 2,3,4- trip he ny tetra zo liu m chloride. A computerized image analysis system (NIH image, version 1.61) was used to measure the infarcted area in the four sections prepared from each mouse. The size of the infarct in the ischemic cortex in each slice was expressed as a percentage after normalization relative to the size of the non ischemic cortex and according to the formula [(area of non ischemic cortex  –  area of remaining ischemic cortex)/area of non ischemic cortex]  $\times\;100$   as previously described (Zhao  et al.  2005). The numbers shown were the average of the four determinations for each mouse. The statistical signi ﬁ cance of the treatment effect on infarct size was assessed using Student ’ s  $t$  -test.

# A novel p harm a co genetic factor for HIT  

The time required for a halo per idol-treated mouse to move all four paws (latency) after it is placed on an inclined screen is a measure of the Parkinson ian-like rigidity caused by HIT. In a previous study (Crowley  et al.  2012b), only 3 of 27 inbred strains manifested a substantial amount of toxicity after haloperidol treatment, and the latency in  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   mice was substantially larger (  $36\%$   and  $59\%$  ) than that of the other two strains (NZW and NZO). Therefore, it was possible that A/J mice uniquely had an additional p harm a co genetic factor that increased its susceptibility to HIT. Since A/J and C57BL/6 exhibit extreme differences in susceptibility to HIT, we examined the susceptibility of 19 different C57BL/6J-A/J chromosome substitution strains (CSS) to better characterize the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to HIT. Since each consomic strain is homosomic for a single speciﬁ ed A/J chromosome on an otherwise C57BL/6 genetic background (Nadeau  et al.  2000), this genome scan will identify genetic susceptibility factors on any autosome. The prolonged latency in consomic mice with an  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   chromosome 12 on an otherwise C57BL/6 genetic background (CSS12 mice) after 5  $(P=2\times10^{-7})$  ) and 10 days   $(P=2\times10^{-5})$  ) of halo per idol treatment is consistent with our previous  ﬁ nding that  Abcb5 alleles affect susceptibility to HIT (Zheng  et al.  2015) (Figure 1). However, this analysis revealed that a genetic factor on chromosome 10 independently contributes to this interstrain difference; CSS10 mice had a signi ﬁ cantly prolonged halo per idol-induced latency after 5   $(P=2\times10^{-6})$  ) and 10 days   $(P=4\times10^{-5})$  ) of drug treatment. In fact, the latency measured in CSS10 mice was twice as large as that of CSS12 mice, and their combined latencies were equivalent to that of  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   mice (Figure 1). This indicates that the p harm a co genetic factors on chromosomes 10 and 12 quantitatively account for the increased susceptibility of A/J mice to HIT. Two other consomic strains (CSS2 and CSS14) exhibited a small increase in latency on the day 10 measurements only. However, no consomic strains (other than CSS10 and CSS12) exhibited latencies after 5 and 10 days of treatment, which were both signi ﬁ cantly prolonged ( i.e. ,  $P<0.05)$  ) relative to those of control mice.  

To determine whether differences in the levels of the oxidative metabolite of halo per idol   $\left(\mathrm{HPP^{+}}\right)$   in brain were associated with susceptibility to HIT, we measured   $\mathsf{H P P^{+}}$  abundance in brain tissue obtained from C57BL/6, A/J, CSS12, and CSS10 mice after treatment with halo per idol  $(3\,\mathrm{mg}\cdot\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{day}^{-1}$    dose from a continuou ase implanted pellet) for 10 days. The concentrations of HPP   in brain were increased in  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$     $(P=3\times10^{-5})$  ) and CSS12   $\left(P=0.004\right)$  ) mice relative to C57BL/6 mice. This result is consistent with the mechanism by which  Abcb5  alleles on chromosome 12 alter the amount of halo per idol in the brain. However, the amount of  $\mathsf{H P P}^{+}$    in brain was not increased in CSS10 mice   $(P=0.4)$  ) ( Figure S1 ), which indicates that the novel p harm a co genetic factor on chromosome 10 affects HIT by a different mechanism. Although it does not affect the amount of  $\mathsf{H P P}^{+}$    in brain, it alters the susceptibility of dopamine r gic neurons to HIT.  

# Identi ﬁ cation of a novel p harm a co genetic factor  

To identify this factor, we examined our SNP database, which was generated by analysis of whole-genome sequence data obtained from 27 inbred strains (Zheng  et al.  2015). We identi ﬁ ed 209 genes on chromosome 10 with SNP alleles that were uniquely present in  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   mice, which were not found in the 17 other strains with available genomic sequence and whose susceptibility to HIT was previously analyzed. However, only 6 genes contained a missense (or nonsense) SNP ( Table S1 ), and one was a highly plausible candidate.  Vnn3 was the only gene on chromosome 10 where an  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}.$  -speci ﬁ c SNP allele introduced a premature stop codon   $(\mathrm{Cln}494{-}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{X})$  , and this produced a 7-amino-acid truncation of the  $\mathtt{V m3}$  protein. The two pan te the in as es ( Vnn1  and  Vnn3)  in the mouse genome are collinear genes on chromosome 10; and both are ec to enzymes that hydrolyze D-pantethein to pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and cysteamine (Robishaw and Neely 1985). Previously, a complex rearrangement within the  Vnn3 promoter region found in A/J mice (and in several other strains) was identi ﬁ ed, and it was thought that this promoter rearrangement reduced the level of expression of the adjacent Vnn1  and  Vnn3  mRNAs, which produced the complete absence of measured hepatic pan te the in as e enzyme activity in A/J mice (Min-Oo  et al.  2007). Therefore, we examined hepatic  Vnn1  and  Vnn3  mRNA levels in A/J and B/6 mice. The normalized level of  Vnn1  mRNA in C57BL/6 liver   $(1.06\pm0.35$  mean  $\pm\nobreakspace S\mathrm{E})$  ) is 20-fold higher than in  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   liver   $(0.054\pm0.009)$  ) ( Figure S2 ). Hence, a negligible level of  Vnn1  mRNA expression in  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   liver is associated with the promoter rearrangement. In contrast, hepatic  Vnn3  mRNA levels were threefold higher than  Vnn1  mRNA levels in C57BL/6 mice, and the hepatic Vnn3 mRNA levels  $(2.99\,\pm\,0.48)$  in C57BL/6 miceare only  ﬁ vefold higher   $(0.65\pm0.10)$   than in A/J mice. These results indicate that the combined presence of the promoter rearrangement and of the  Vnn3  SNP allele that produces a truncated  $\mathtt{V m3}$   protein together are responsible for the absence of hepatic pan to the in as e activity in  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   mice. None of the other strains, including the two strains with a reduced level of susceptibility to HIT, have the  $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{J}.$  -speci ﬁ c SNP allele that truncates Vnn3. Moreover, the cysteamine produced by these ec to enzymes is required for optimal in ﬂ ammatory and anti oxidative responses (Pitari  et al.  2000; Berruyer

Figure 1  HIT in C57BL/6J, A/J, and 19 chromosome substitution strains. The time (latency) required for a mouse to make a coordinated movement after it is placed on a vertical mesh screen before (day 0) and after treatment with halo per idol  $(3\,\mathsf{m g}\!\cdot\!\mathsf{k g}^{-1}\!\cdot\!\mathsf{d a y}^{-1}$    via continuous release from an implanted pellet) for 5 or 10 days is shown. Each bar represents the average  $\pm\textsf{S E M}$   for three to four mice per strain. Only CSS12 and CSS10 mice (which have A/J alleles for every gene on chromosome 12 or 10, respectively, on an otherwise C57BL/6 background) had signi ﬁ cantly increased latencies after both 5 and 10 days of halo per idol treatment. No other CSS mice exhibited a signi ﬁ cant increase in latency after treatment day 5; and the small increases in the measured latencies of CSS2 and CSS14 mice after 10 days of halo per idol treatment were not signi ﬁ cant  $\left<P>0.05\right>$  ) after correction for the multiple comparisons.  

et al.  2004; Martin  et al.  2004). Cysteamine can be exogenously administered as cystamine, which is rapidly metabolized to its reduced form (cysteamine)  in vivo  (Bousquet  et al. 2010). Indeed, it is already known that A/J mice are susceptible to malaria infection because their pan te the in as e de ﬁ - ciency reduces their ability to mount an immune response to malarial parasites and that cystamine administration partially reverses their increased susceptibility(Min-Oo  et al.  2007).  

Since cysteamine can cross the blood – brain barrier (Bousquet  et al.  2010), the inability of the  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   liver to produce cysteamine reduces the amount of cysteamine available to the brain, which could be needed to protect against the Parkinson ian-like toxicity caused by  $\mathsf{H P P}^{+}$  . By this proposed genetic mechanism, the cysteamine de ﬁ ciency caused by the A/J-speci ﬁ c  Vnn1/Vnn3  alleles could increase sus ce pti bility to HIT. To test this genetic hypothesis, we investigated whether p harm a co logical correction for the pan te the in as e de ﬁ ciency would alter the susceptibility of   $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   mice to HIT. We examined whether cystamine administration  $(10\mathrm{\:mg{\cdot}k g^{-1}{\cdot}d a y^{-1}})$   would decrease the halo per idol-induced latency in A/J mice. A relatively high dose of halo per idol (  $\cdot10\,\mathrm{m}g\cdot\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$  ' day 2 1   ip) did not increase the latency measured in resistant C57BL/6 mice, but it signi ﬁ cantly increased the latency in  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   mice. To determine whether cystamine could prevent the onset of HIT, cystamine was administered daily for 4 days before halo per idol treatment was initiated (Figure 2A).

Figure 2  Cystamine co administration prevents HIT. (A) In the prevention protocol, mice are  ﬁ rst treated with cystamine   $\cdot10\ \mathsf{m g}{\cdot}\mathsf{k g}^{-1}{\cdot}\mathsf{d a y}^{-1}$    ip) for 4 days, followed by treatment with halo per idol   $(10\mathsf{\ m g}{\cdot}\mathsf{k g}^{-1}{\cdot}\mathsf{d a y}^{-1}$    ip) and cystamine   $\cdot10\ \mathsf{m g}{\cdot}\mathsf{k g}^{-1}{\cdot}\mathsf{d a y}^{-1}$    ip). A control group of mice received only halo per idol. The halo per idol-induced latency is then measured after  ${\geq}2$   days of halo per idol treatment in each group of mice. (B and C) Cystamine prevents HIT in A/J (B) and CSS10 (C) mice. The latency measured in C57BL/6 and A/J mice (B), or in CSS10 mice (C), on the indicated day of halo per idol treatment according to the prevention protocol is shown. Each bar represents the average    $\pm\textsf{S E M}$   for three to four mice per strain, and the dashed horizontal line indicates the average pretreatment latency. Halo per idol increases the latency in A/J and CSS10 mice, but not in  ${\mathsf{C}}57{\mathsf{B}}{\mathsf{L}}/6,$  , mice. The calculated  $P$  -values for comparison of the cystamine-treated A/J (B) or CSS10 mice (C) and control groups are shown for each treatment day.  

Cystamine co administration signi ﬁ cantly reduced the latency in A/J mice after 2   $(P=8.0\times10^{-3})$  ), 3   $(P=9\times10^{-5})$  ), and 4  $(P=6\times10^{-4})$  ) days of halo per idol treatment (Figure 2B). Importantly, cystamine co administration reduced the latency to background levels after 3 or 4 days of halo per idol treatment. To determine whether cystamine treatment affected the susceptibility caused by the p harm a co genetic factor on chromosome 10, the effect of cystamine was examined in CSS10 mice, which have an  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   chromosome 10 on an otherwise C57BL/6genetic background. Cysteamine co administration signi ﬁ cantly reduced the halo per idol-induced latency in CSS10 mice after 3   $\left(P=0.02\right)$  , 4   $(P=3\times10^{-4})$  ), 5   $(P=$  0.002), 6   $(P\,=\,0.004)$  ), and 7   $(P\,=\,3\,\times\,10^{-4})$  ) days of halo per idol treatment (Figure 2C). Thus, cystamine coadministration can protect against the genetic susceptibility caused by  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   alleles on chromosome 10.  

We next examined whether cystamine administration could reverse the Parkinson ian-like symptoms of HIT after it was established. To do this,  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   mice were treated with halo per idol   $(10\mathrm{\meg{\cdot}k g^{-1}{\cdot}d a y^{-1}})$   alone for 3 days, followed by daily doses of cystamine   $(10\,\mathrm{mg}\cdot\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{day}^{-1})$   and haloperidol   $(10\mathrm{\meg{\cdot}k g^{-1}{\cdot}d a y^{-1}})$   on days 4 – 13 (reversal protocol). We found that the halo per idol-induced latencies were not altered in mice that were treated with cystamine in this manner (Figure 3). Thus, although cystamine co administration

# Investigating the neuro protective effect of cystamine  

Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the neuro protective effects of cystamine, which have been observed in diverse disease models (Karpuj  et al.  2002; BorrellPages  et al.  2006; Hsu  et al.  2008; Pillai  et al.  2008; Gibrat et al.  2010). For example, cystamine is a potent antioxidant (Di Leandro  et al.  2008), and it is a competitive inhibitor of trans glut a minas e 2 (Jeitner  et al.  2005), which is a multifunctional enzyme whose inappropriate activation is linked with the pathogen es is of multiple disease conditions, including Parkinson ’ s disease (reviewed in Iismaa  et al.  2009; Grosso and Mouradian 2012). However, none of the proposed mechanisms for the neuro protective effect of cystamine were observed across different models, nor were they sustained across the time points tested in these models. Since HIT has a rapid onset, develops in a strain-speci ﬁ c manner, and is reversed by cystamine co administration, this model could be used to characterize the neuro protective effect of cystamine. Because of its reported antioxidant activity (Di Leandro et al.  2008), we  ﬁ rst investigated whether cystamine reduces the amount of the oxidative metabolite of halo per idol   $\left(\mathrm{HPP^{+}}\right)$  produced in brain tissue. We found that pre treatment with cystamine, followed by co administration with each haloperidol dose, did not reduce the abundance of  $\mathsf{H P P}^{+}$    in brain tissue obtained from  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   in two separate experiments (  $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}$  -values   $=$  0.98 and 0.30) ( Figure S3 , A and B). The liver also generates a signi ﬁ cant amount of   $\mathsf{H P P}^{+}$  , and hepatic  $\mathsf{H P P}^{+}$    was also not reduced by cystamine co administration   $(P\mathrm{-value}=0.42)$  ) ( Figure S2 B). Thus, we could not  ﬁ nd any evidence that the cystamine reduced the production of the toxicity-inducing metabolite in brain or other tissues.  

We next investigated whether the protective effect of cysteamine is mediated via an effect on gene transcription. For example, cysteamine is known to be an inhibitor of transglutaminase 2 (Jeitner  et al.  2005), whose activity affects the expression of many genes in brain (McCon ough ey  et al.  2010); and cysteamine activates NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) in brain tissue (Calkins  et al.  2010). Through an effect on transglutaminase 2, Nrf2, or other transcription factors, cysteamine could affect the neuronal response to drug or disease-induced insults (reviewed in Grosso and Mouradian 2012). Therefore, wholetranscript ome pro ﬁ ling was used to examine the strain-speci ﬁ c nature of HIT and the neuro protective effect of cystamine. Gene expression pro ﬁ ling was performed on striatal tissue isolated from  ﬁ ve groups of mice   $(n=3–4$   mice per group): A/J mice treated with (i) halo per idol and cystamine, (ii) haloperidol alone, or (iii) vehicle or C57BL/6J mice treated with (iv) halo per idol or (v) vehicle. The microarray data were  ﬁ tted to linear regression models, which were designed to identify genes whose expression was altered by halo per idol treatment in a strain-speci ﬁ c manner and halo per idol-induced gene expression changes that were reversed by cystamine treatment. This analysis identi ﬁ ed 172 genes whose expression was altered by halo per idol treatment in a strain-speci ﬁ c manner ( Table S2 ) and 110 genes whose expression was altered by cystamine treatment ( Table S3 ). Thus, halo per idol induces a substantial number of gene expression changes in the striatum, which occur in a strain-speci ﬁ c manner.  

There are 32 genes commonly present in  Table S2  and  Table S3 , and these represent strain-speci ﬁ c halo per idol-induced gene expression changes that were partially or fully reversed by cystamine treatment (Table 1). These are of particular interest, since they are highly likely to be associated with HIT. Interestingly, the biological functions most highly associated with these 32 genes were body size/feeding behavior (ranks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) and neuro transmission or movement disorder (ranks 7 and 8) ( Table S4 ). These categories are consistent with the side effects (movement disorder and weight changes) caused by the DRD2 antagonists used as antipsychotic agents (Parkes 1982). RT-PCR was used to further analyze the expression changes for 9 of the 32 genes in Table 1 that exhibited the highest level of halo per idol-induced differential expression. For 7 of these 9 genes, the RT-PCR-measured expression changes were consistent with those measured by the micro arrays ( Table S5 ). The expression changes for two of these genes were of interest, since both were previously associated with Parkinson ’ s disease (discussed below). The striatal levels of mRNA expression for the precursor of melanin concentrating hormone ( Pmch ) and the transcription factor  FosB  were 60-fold decreased   $(P\,=\,0.04)$  ) and 5-fold increased   $(P\;=$  0.003), respectively, by halo per idol treatment in  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   mice

 (Figure 4). Moreover, the halo per idol-induced decrease in Pmch  mRNA expression occurred only in A/J mice and was reversed by cystamine co administration   $P=0.57$   relative to the vehicle-treated group).

Four hours after the last treatment, striatal tissue was harvested, and the level of  Pmch  or  Fosb  mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR analysis. Halo per idol treatment decreases  Pmch  and increases Fosb  mRNA levels by 60-fold   $\left(P=0.04\right)$  ) and 5-fold   $\left(P=0.003\right)$  ), respectively, in A/J mice. Their expression in C57BL/6 mice was not altered by halo per idol treatment, and the halo per idol-induced expression changes in A/J mice were completely   $(P m c h)$     $(P=0.57$   relative to vehicle-treated group) or partially   $(F o s b)$     $(P=0.07\$   relative to vehicle-treated group) reversed by cystamine co administration.  

# Cystamine protects against ischemic brain injury  

Like HIT, the extent of brain injury developing after experimentally induced ischemia is a highly heritable and highly variable (  $\cdot{\sim}30$  -fold) trait among the inbred strains (Keum and Marchuk 2009). Of note, the extent of ischemic brain damage in  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   mice was reported to be signi ﬁ cantly greater than in C57BL/6 mice (Keum and Marchuk 2009). Since cystamine protected dopamine r gic neurons in A/J mice against HIT, we used a well-established model of focal cerebral ischemia (Keum and Marchuk 2009) to determine whether cystamine could also protect brain tissue against ischemic damage. To do this, the volume of infarcted cortical tissue was measured  $24{\mathrm{\,hr}}$   after occlusion of the distal part of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). To determine whether this response was indeed heritable, we examined the extent of ischemic brain damage in  $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{J}$  , CSS10, and C57BL/6 mice. Consistent with prior results (Keum and Marchuk 2009), we observed the extent of ischemic brain damage in A/J mice was  ${>}2$  -fold greater than in C57BL/6J mice   $(P=2\times10^{-5})$  ). Moreover, the extent of ischemic damage in CSS10 mice was also increased (1.8-fold,  $P=4\times10^{-3}$  ) relative to that in C57BL/6 mice; and the level of ischemic damage in CSS10 mice was similar to that observed in  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   mice (Figure 5). These results indicate that  $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{J}$   mice are more susceptible than C57BL/6 mice to ischemic brain injury and that  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   alleles on chromosome 10 could also affect susceptibility to ischemic brain injury. If the  Vnn  alleles on chromosome 10 affect susceptibility,  

![](images/470838519a998ffff255568706e05bcbe2cae31dc1cb9926a888c1bc3120bee9.jpg)  
Figure 5  The size of an experimentally induced ischemic brain infarct in A/J and CSS10 mice is greater than in C57BL/6J mice. Infarct size was measured 24 hr postdistal MCA occlusion by 2,3,4-trip he ny tetra zo liu m (TTC) staining of whole brain sections prepared from C57BL/6J   $(n=4)$  , A/J   $(n=4)$  , or CSS10   $(n=4)$  ) mice. The extent of ischemic brain damage in A/J mice was twofold greater than in C57BL/6J mice   $(P\,=\,2\,\times\,10^{-5})$  ). The extent of ischemic damage in CSS10 mice was 1.8-fold increased relative to that in C57BL/6 mice   $(P=4\,\times\,10^{-3})$   and was similar to that observed in A/J mice. The scanned images of TTCstained whole brain sections for each animal and the measured infarct size (expressed as the percentage of the cortex) are shown. Each bar represents the average   $(\pm\textsf{S E M})$   of the infarct volume in the percentage of total cortex volume.  

then cystamine administration should reduce the extent of ischemic brain injury in both  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   and CSS10 mice. MCA occlusion produced a substantial volume of infarction (56.8  $\pm\ 2.4\%)$   in control   $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   mice, which was dramatically reduced   $(44.0\,\pm\,3.6\%)$  ) in mice that were pretreated with cystamine   $\left(P=0.01\right)$  )  ( Figure 6 ) . Cystamine administration reduced the infarct volume by  $23\%$  , which translates into the preservation of a signi ﬁ cant amount of brain tissue after an ischemic insult. The protective effect of cystamine was also demonstrable in CSS10 mice; the infarct size in control CSS10 mice   $(50.1\pm4.0\%)$  ) was reduced to   $27.5\,\pm\,3.0\%$   by cystamine treatment   $\left(P=0.02\right)$  ) (Figure 6).  

C57BL/6J mice have  Vnn  alleles that confer normal pan te the in as e enzyme activity and had lower levels of ischemic brain injury in the MCA occlusion model. Therefore, we investigated whether cystamine supplement ation, which produces supra ph y sio logic levels of cysteamine in the recipients, would reduce the extent of ischemic brain injury after MCA occlusion in C57BL/6 mice. Cystamine administration had a protective effect against ischemic brain damage in C57BL/6 mice; the infarct size after MCA occlusion was reduced from  $25.4\,\pm\,2.1\%$   in the control group to   $16.4\,\pm\,2.8\%$   in the cystamine-treated group   $(P\,=\,0.028)$   (Figure 6). Of note, the level of ischemic damage in untreated C57BL/6 mice was  ${\sim}50\%$   of that in  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   or CSS10 mice, and cystamine treatment conferred a lesser degree of protection in C57BL/6 mice relative to that in  $\mathsf{A}\sqrt{\mathsf{J}}$   or CSS10 mice. Nevertheless, these results indicate that p harm a co logical levels of cysteamine — which are attained through cystamine supplement ation — can protect against ischemic brain injury, even when physiological amounts of cysteamine are being produced.  

# Discussion  

The results in our previous article (Zheng  et al.  2015), along with those described here, provide the  ﬁ rst complete characterization of p harm a co genetic factors affecting susceptibility to a drug-induced CNS toxicity. The differential susce pti bil it y of inbred strains to HIT is determined by at least two p harm a co genetic factors: (i)  Abcb5  alleles, which regulate brain halo per idol levels after a dose of halo per idol (Zheng  et al.  2015), and (ii) a locus on chromosome 10, which may include the candidate  $V n n\mathcal{I}\sqrt{3}$   alleles that we propose eliminate cysteamine biosynthesis. Since both of these loci contribute to susceptibility, if a strain does not have A/J Abcb5 alleles, it may not be susceptible to HIT even though it has the A/J Vnn1/3 alleles. While proving that the A/J Vnn1/ 3 alleles are indeed causal would require further genetic dissection, we demonstrate that cystamine co administration can completely prevent the onset of a halo per idol-induced movement disorder in mice, which resembles that of human Parkinson ’ s disease. Since other commonly used drugs [ e.g. , pro chl or per a zine (Drotts and Vinson 1999) and me to clop rami de (Moos and Hansen 2008)] cause EPS (Orti-Pareja  et al. 1999), this raises the possibility that cystamine co admin is tration could prevent the EPS caused by these drugs. Of note, there are three human orthologs of the murine pan te the in as e genes ( VNN1 ,  VNN2 , and  VNN3 ) (Martin  et al.  2001). Human VNN1  alleles have been associated with differences in human VNN1  mRNA expression (Goring  et al.  2007; Kaskow  et al. 2013) and in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (Goring  et al.  2007; Jacobo-Albavera  et al.  2012). Thus, it is possible that genetic variation in human pan te the in as e genes could also affect susceptibility EPS caused by antipsychotic agents and other drugs.  

The strain-speci ﬁ c and cystamine-reversible gene expression changes caused by halo per idol provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying HIT and the neuro protective effect of cystamine. First, halo per idol induced a substantial number of strain-speci ﬁ c gene expression changes in the striatum, and many   $(19\%)$   of these were reversed by cystamine treatment. Although these results do not implicate a speci ﬁ c  

![](images/0a082ca0ea2aec256c5b0f92dd53a29f1a27f08727d10a79bd9a24bc106141d2.jpg)  
Figure 6  Cystamine administration reduces the infarct volume after ischemic injury in A/J, CSS10, and C57BL/ 6J mice. Male A/J, CSS10, and C57BL/6J mice were treated with cystamine   $(10\mathsf{\m g}{\cdot}\mathsf{k g}^{-1}{\cdot}\mathsf{d a y}^{-1}$    ip  $(n=5$  , 4, and 8 mice per group, respectively) or saline (  = 8, 4, and 7 mice per group, respectively) for 5 days. Then,  $24\;\mathsf{h r}$   after MCA occlusion, whole brains were obtained to assess the infarct size. Each bar represents the average   $(\pm\textsf{S E M})$  ) of the infarct size. The infarct size in the control group was signi ﬁ cantly reduced by cystamine administration in A/J mice   $\%.8\%$   vs.  $44.0\%$  ,  $P=0.01$  ), CSS10 mice   $(50.1\%$  vs.    $27.5\%$  ,  $P\,=\,0.02,$  ) and C57BL/6J mice   $25.4\%$   vs.  $16.4\%$  ,  $P=0.028,$  ).  

molecular target, they suggest that the neuro protective effect of cystamine could be mediated by an effect on transcription. Second, it is striking that halo per idol selectively reduced striatal Pmch  mRNA expression in the susceptible strain. A selective loss of MCH neurons has been noted in Parkinson ’ s disease (Thannickal  et al.  2007), and the degree of MCH neuronal loss correlates with the clinical stage of Parkinson ’ s disease (Thannickal  et al.  2008). Third, the halo per idol-induced increase in striatal  Fosb  mRNA expression is also of interest. Increased striatal expression of a splicing isoform of  Fosb  ( D Fosb ) was associated with progression of Parkinson ’ s disease (Tekumalla  et al.  2001). Moreover, striatal over expression of D Fosb  in rats (Cao  et al.  2010) or of a dominant negative  D Fosb inhibitor in primates (Berton  et al.  2009) increased or decreased, respectively, the development of involuntary movement disorders in animal models of Parkinson ’ s disease. Given these similarities to Parkinson ’ s disease, our results support the possibility that cystamine administration could prevent or delay the onset of neuro degenerative diseases. Cystamine treatment was previously shown to be of bene ﬁ t in murine models of Huntington ’ s disease (Dedeoglu  et al.  2002; Karpuj  et al. 2002; Wang  et al.  2005) and Parkinson ’ s disease (Sun  et al. 2010). Of note, cysteamine (as a bitartrate salt) has received Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of a genetic disease (cystinosis) (Dohil  et al.  2010) and has recently been evaluated as a potential treatment for Huntington ’ s disease (Borrell-Pages  et al.  2006) and for Parkinson ’ s disease (Gibrat and Cicchetti 2011).  

Consistent with the results of multiple prior studies, we also demonstrate that cystamine has a broader neuro protective effect. In this case, it had a substantial neuro protective effect in an experimental mouse model of ischemic cerebral stroke. Stroke is a devastating neurological disorder that causes impairment, disability, and death (Tu 2010). A recent study demonstrated that administration of cystamine after ischemic brain injury occurred could improve functional recovery from stroke in mice. However, in that study, cystamine administration had no effect on infarct size, and its effect on recovery was ascribed to an increase in the production of brain-derived neuro troph ic factor (BDNF) (Li  et al.  2014). Other investigators have also implicated the cystamine-induced increase in BDNF production (and increased axonal growth) as the reason for its bene ﬁ cial effects (Pillai  et al.  2008; Gibrat  et al.  2010). However, in our study, the neuro protective effect of cystamine pretreatment occurred within   $24{\mathrm{~hr}}$   after stroke induction, which is a time period that is far too rapid for its neuro protective effect to be due to an increase in neural regeneration. Thus, the neuro protective effects of cystamine — whether for ischemic injury or HIT — occur via another mechanism that has yet to be identi ﬁ ed. Additional analysis of the genes with halo per idolinduced changes in their level of expression, especially those that were strain speci ﬁ c and cysteamine reversible, may provide a useful starting point in the search for this un characterized mechanism. There is also a need for additional characterization of the relationship between  $\mathrm{V}\mathrm{nn}1/3$  and susceptibility to HIT. Given the pleotropic effects of cystamine on neurologic responses, further studies involving gene knockout mice could be used to provide more direct experimental evidence of this relationship.  

In summary, characterization of p harm a co genetic factors affecting HIT in a murine model has identi ﬁ ed a new approach for preventing the dose-limiting toxicity of an antipsychotic agent. Co administration of cystamine could prevent the movement disorder caused by halo per idol, which could improve outcomes for individuals with psychotic diseases. Moreover, these results indicate that subsequent clinical studies should be performed to investigate whether cystamine administration could reduce the extent of brain damage in individuals with ischemic stroke.

Figure S3 . Cystamine treatment does not reduce HPP +  levels in halo per idol-treated mice.  ( A ) C57BL/6 and A/J mice (  $\mathsf{'n=}4$   per  group) were treated with vehicle or cystamine (10mg/kg/day IP) for 3 days, followed by 4 days of treatment with halo per idol (10  mg/kg/day IP) in the absence or presence of cystamine (10 mg/kg/day IP). Four hours after the last dose of halo per idol, the  amount of the oxidative metabolite of halo per idol   $(\mathsf{H P P}^{+})$   in brain was measured. Cystamine co-administration did not alter the  amount of  $\mathsf{H P P}^{+}$   present in brain tissue obtained from A/J (p-value  $=0.98$  ) mice.  (B)  A/J mice were treated with vehicle or  cystamine (  $10\;\mathsf{m g/k g}\;\mathsf{I P}$  ) for 2 days, followed by treatment with halo per idol (  $10\;\mathsf{m g/k g/d a y\;1P})$   in the absence or presence of  cystamine (  $10\;\mathsf{m g/k g}\;\mathsf{I P}$   for 2 more days. Four hours after last injection of halo per idol, the amount of halo per idol (HP) and its  oxidative metabolite   $(\mathsf{H P P}^{+})$   was measured in brain and liver tissue. The hepatic level of   $\mathsf{H P P}^{+}$   was also not reduced by  cystamine co-administration (p-value  $\scriptstyle{:=0.42}$  ). Each bar represents the average  $\pm$   SEM for each indicated group.

Table S5 .  RT-PCR analysis of striatal gene expression.  Nine genes were identified by microarray analysis as having halo per idolinduced expression changes in striatum that were strain-specific and reversible by cystamine co-administration.   The mRNA levels for  these 9 genes were analyzed by RT-PCR analysis in striatal tissue obtained from   C57BL/6 or   A/J mice treated with vehicle or  olanzapine (5 mg/kg/day x 3 days PO). One group of olanzapine-treated A/J mice was also treated with   cystamine (10 mg/kg BID  IP). The fold change (FC) and   $\mathsf{p}$  -values for each of the indicated comparisons are shown for the microarray and RT-PCR data are  shown. ND: not determined. The mRNAs for 3 genes ( Pmch, Fosb , and  Slc4a2 ) whose halo per idol-induced expression changes in  A/J striatal tissue measured by RT-PCR that had   $\mathsf{p}$  -values  ${<}0.05$   are shown in red. A  $(\cdot)$   sign indicates that the mRNA was down  regulated. The treatment groups are: Hal: halo per idol; Cys  $^+$  Hal: cystamine and halo per idol co-administration; Ctrl: vehicle control;  ND: not determined.
