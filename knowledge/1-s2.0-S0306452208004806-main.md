Abstract—S-nitro syl ation, a s a post-translational protein modi cation, recently has been paid more and more attention in stroke research. S-nitro syl ation regulates protein function by the mechanisms of covalent attachment that control the addition or the removal of nitric oxide (NO) from a cysteine thiol. The derivation of NO is established by the demonstration that, in cerebral neurons, NO mainly generates from neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) during the early stages of reperfusion. In the past researches, we demonstrate that global ischemia–reperfusion facilitates the activation of glutamate receptor 6 (GluR6) –mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. The objective of this study is primarily to determine, during the early stages of reperfusion in rat four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) ischemic model, whether nNOS-derived NO affects the GluR6-mediated JNK signaling route via S-nitro syl ation which is performed mainly by the biotin switch assay. Here, we show that administration of 7-nitro in daz ole, an inhibitor of nNOS, or ketamine, an antagonist of  N  -methylD  -aspartate receptor (NMDAR), diminishes the increased S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 induced by cerebral ischemia– reperfusion. In contrast, 2-amion-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H1,3-thiazine, an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase does not affect S-nitro syl ation of GluR6. Moreover, treatment with sodium nitro prussi de (SNP), an exogenous NO donor, increases the S-nitro syl ation and phosphor yl ation of nNOS, leading to the attenuation of the increased S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 and the assembling of GluR6 ●   post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) ●   mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) signaling module induced by cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. The results also show that GluR6 downstream MLK3 ●   mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 4/7 ●   JNK signaling module and nuclear or non-nuclear apoptosis pathways are involved in the above signaling route. However, dith io th re it ol (DTT) antagonizes the neuro protection of SNP. Treatment with DTT alone, as a negative control, prevents S-nitro syl ation of proteins, which indicates the existence of endogenous ly produced S-nitro syl ation. These data suggest that GluR6 is Snitro syl a ted by endogenous NO in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion, which is possibly correlated with NMDAR ●   PSD95 ● nNOS signaling module, and further activates GluR6 ●   PSD95 ● MLK3 signaling module and JNK signaling pathway. In contrast, exogenous NO donor antagonizes the above action of endogenous NO generated from nNOS. Thus, our results provide the coupling of nNOS with GluR6 by S-nitro syl ation during the early stages of ischemia–reperfusion, which can be a new approach for stroke therapy.   $\circledcirc$   2008 IBRO.

Recently, nitric oxide (NO) has been considered to mediate responses by activating a cGMP-independent pathway in ischemia–reperfusion. S-nitro syl ation is known as one clear example of cGMP-independent actions of NO by the covalent attachment to the side chain of cysteine ( Hess et al., 2005 ). S-nitro syl ation is termed a modi cation that reversibly add NO to the thiol moiety of reactive cysteine residues. This direct chemical reaction with proteins modiﬁed by NO occurs through a complex chemical mechanism without the assistance of enzymes ( Stamler et al., 1992; Ahern et al., 2002 ). As a general rule, S-nitro syl ation reactions result in speciﬁc physiological or path oph y sio logical actions by modifying protein function.  

Recent researches suggest that either exogenous or endogenous NO S-nitro sy late s cysteine residues in proteins ( Jaffrey et al., 2001 ). Endo the li al nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are known as identiﬁed enzymes responsible for endogenous NO production. Both nNOS and iNOS are known to exist in brain. It is known that, nNOS mediates early neuronal injury while iNOS contributes to late neuronal injury ( Samdani et al., 1997 ). nNOS is expressed primarily in neurons, and iNOS mainly under pathological conditions, including in macrophages, microglia, neurons and astrocytes. Of these, nNOS is constitutive ly expressed and responds to calcium-calmodulin signaling, iNOS is induced by in amma tory mediators and is coupled to an activated calmodulin that does not require calcium for activation ( Samdani et al., 1997; Parratt, 1998 ). NO biosynthesis by nNOS in brain is preferentially activated by calcium inﬂux through  N -methylD -aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors, which form a post synaptic protein complex together with nNOS assembled by post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) ( Christopher son et al., 1999; Sattler et al., 1999 ). Phosphor yl ation of nNOS at Ser847 is induced by endogenous  ${\mathsf{C}}a^{2+}$  /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMK II) in rat hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia ( Osuka et al., 2002; Watanabe et al., 2003; Yan et al., 2004 ). NO production is reduced by phosphor yl ation of nNOS at Ser847, which limits the activity of nNOS ( Hayashi et al., 1999; Komeima et al., 2000 ). Similarly, S-nitro syl ation of nNOS inhibits the activity of nNOS and decreases NO generation ( Abu-Soud et al., 1995 ). In brief, the down-regulation of endogenous NO production during the early stages of reperfusion is regulated via both phosphor yl ation and S-nitro syl ation of nNOS.  

Our previous researches have showed that global ischemia–reperfusion can promote the combination of glutamate receptor 6 (GluR6) and mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) with PSD95 which peaks at   $6~\mathsf{h}$   after reperfusion. Our recent studies have also demonstrated that GluR6, one of the ﬁve subunits of kainate receptor, can form a triplicate complex by assembling PSD95 as well as MLK3 to facilitate the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) ( Pei et al., 2005, 2006 ). In order to downregulate the reperfusion injury, it is necessary to depress the assembling of GluR6 ● PSD95 ● MLK3, i.e. treatment with Tat-GluR6-9c, GluR6 antisense ODNs or application of GluR6-deﬁcient mice. In any event, the regulation of GluR6 might be the focus.  

It is known that one site of c-jun, a translation factor, can be phosphor y late d by JNK; Bcl-2, a mitochondrial protein, is the non-nuclear substrate of JNK. Our previous studies have showed that JNK3 can be activated during ischemia–reperfusion in rat hippo camp al ( Gu et al., 2001; Tian et al., 2005 ). Our previous studies have also demonstrated, on one hand, activated JNK may trans locate into the nucleus, leading to cell apoptosis by phosphor y latin g c-jun and enhancing the expression of Fas ligand (FasL); on the other hand, activated JNK can cause mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis by regulating the activity of Bcl-2 and inducing the release of cytochrome c ( Guan et al., 2005 ). In the end, FasL can contribute to Fas receptormediated apoptosis and cytochrome c can activate caspase 3 and result in apoptosis.  

Based on the above researches, we make the hypothesis that nNOS-derived NO, during the early stages of ischemia–reperfusion, can S-nitro sy late GluR6 and inﬂuence the assembling of GluR6 ● PSD95 ● MLK3 signaling module. In this study, we demonstrated that cerebral ischemia induced S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 at different time points of reperfusion; exogenous NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) might inhibit the activation of nNOS, leading to the decrease of S-nitro syl a ted GluR6 during the early stages of reperfusion; SNP further down-regulated the downstream signaling pathway of JNK. Thus, the results indicate the coupling between nNOS and GluR6 mediated by S-nitro syl ation.

# Induction of ischemia  

Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing   $200{-}250~\mathsf{g}$   were used (Shanghai Experimental Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China). The number of used rats totally reached about 600. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by a four-vessel occluded (4-VO) method as described previously ( Pulsinelli and Brierley, 1979 ). Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate   $(300\,\mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{k g}$  , intra peritoneal ly) before both vertebral arteries were occluded permanently by electro c aute ry and both carotid arteries were isolated. Then rats were allowed to recover for   $\boldsymbol{24~\mathsf{h}}$  , and both carotid arteries were occluded with aneurysm clips to induce cerebral ischemia without the administration of chloral hydrate. After occlusion for  $15\;\mathsf{m i n}$  , the aneurysm clips were removed for reperfusion. Rats who lost their righting reﬂex within  $30\:\mathfrak{s}$   and those whose pupils were dilated and unresponsive to light were selected for the experiments. Rectal temperature was maintained at   $36.5-$   $37.5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   during ischemia   $.15\,\mathsf{m i n})$  ) and the  $\sf_{2\,\sf h}$   reperfusion. Sham control rats were treated using the same surgical procedures except that the carotid arteries were not occluded.  

# Administration of drugs  

The rats were injected, three times with a interval of   $1.5\,\mathsf{h}$  , intraperitoneally with SNP dissolved in  $0.9\%$   NaCl at a dose of  $5\,\mathsf{m g/k g}$  . The ﬁrst injection was given 30 min before ischemia. KT   $(30~{\mathsf{m g/k g}})$   or AMT   $(0.65\,\mathsf{m g/k g})$   dissolved in  $0.9\%$   NaCl was given intra peritoneal ly  $20~\mathsf{m i n}$   before ischemia. 7-NI   $(25\ \mathsf{m g/k g})$  ) dissolved in   $1\%$   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was intra peritoneal ly injected  $20\;\mathsf{m i n}$   before ischemia. DTT, dissolved in  $0.9\%$   NaCl at a dose of  $10\,\mathsf{m M}$  , was administered intra cerebro ventricular ly (  $10\ \mu{\mathrm{I}}$  ; bregma:   $1.5\,\mathrm{\mum}$   lateral,  $0.8\;\mathsf{m m}$   posterior,  $3.8\;\mathsf{m m}$   deep). Control rats were intra peritoneal ly or intra cerebro ventricular ly given corresponding solvent,  $0.9\%$   NaCl or   $1\%$   DMSO.  

# Sample preparation  

Rats were decapitated immediately after different times of reperfusion, and then the hippo camp al CA1 were isolated and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing   $50~\mathrm{\textmuM}$   MOPS (pH

 7.4; Sigma),   $100\,\mathrm{\textmuM}$   KCl,   $320\,\mathrm{\mum}$   sucrose,   $50\,\mathrm{\mum}$   NaF,

The homo gen at es were centrifuged at   $800\!\times\!g$   for   $10\,\mathrm{\mum}$   at   $4\ \mathrm{{}^{\circ}C}$  . Super nat ants were collected, and protein concentration was determined by the method of  Lowry et al. (1951 ). Samples were stored at    $-80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and were thawed only once until used.

(A, C) To detect the phosphorylation of Ser-847, samples from hippo cam apl CA1 region were directly WB with anti-NP847 antibody. S-nitro syl ation of nNOS was determined by biotin-switch assay: all of the S-nitro syl a ted proteins were precipitated with strep t avid in-agarose, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-nNOS antibody to detect S-nitro syl ation of nNOS.  

When necessary, the hippo camp al CA1 were immediately isolated to prepare mitochondrial fractions. All procedures were conducted in a cold room. Generally, unfrozen brain tissue was used to prepare mitochondrial fractions because freezing tissue causes release of cytochrome    $c$   from mitochondria. The hippocampal CA1 were homogenized in 1:10 (w/v) ice-cold homogenization buffer. The homo gen at es were centrifuged at  $800\!\times\!g$   for  $10~\mathsf{m i n}$   at  $4\ \mathrm{{}^{\circ}C}$  . The pellets were discarded, and super nat ants were centrifuged at   $17{,}000{\times}g$   for   $20~\mathsf{m i n}$   at  $4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   to obtain the cytosolic fraction in the super nat ants and the crude mitochondrial fraction in the pellets. The protein concentrations were determined by the method of  Lowry et al. (1951 ).  

# Nuclear extraction  

The homo gen at es were centrifuged at   $800\!\times\!g$   for 10 min at  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Super nat ants (cytosolic fraction) were collected, and protein concent rations were determined. The nuclear pellets were extracted with  $20\;\mathsf{m M}$   Hepes   $(\mathsf{p H\,7.9})$  ),  $z0\%$   glycerol, 420 mM NaCl,  $0.5\:\mathsf{m M}$   ${\sf M g C l}_{2}$   $1\ \mathsf{m M}$   dith io th re it ol, and en- zyme inhibitors for 30 min at  $4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   with constant agitation. After cent ri fuga tion at   $12{,}000{\times}g$   for 15 min at  $4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , super nat ants (nuclear fraction) were collected, and protein concentrations were determined. Samples were stored at    $-80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and were thawed only once until used.  

# Determination of protein S-nitro syl ation  

Measurement of S-nitro syl a ted nNOS or GluR6 was performed by immuno precipitation with anti-nNOS or anti-GluR6 antibody, followed by separately immuno blotting with anti-SNO-Cys antibody, or by the biotin switch assay. The biotin switch assay was performed as described previously by  Jaffrey et al. (2001 ), using low-light conditions and opaque tubes. Brieﬂy, the hippocampi were homogenized in HEN buffer (  $250\,\mathsf{m M}$   Hepes–NaOH,  $\mathsf{p H}\,7.7$  , 1 mM EDTA,   $0.1\ \mathsf{m M}$   neo cup roi ne). Free thiols were blocked by methyl ation with methyl methane th ios ulf on ate (Sigma). Unreacted methyl methane th ios ulf on ate was removed by protein precipitation in 10 volumes of acetone   $(-20\ ^{\circ}{\mathsf{C}})$  . Cysteine residues that had been S-nitro syl a ted by NO-Cbl were converted to free thiols with sodium ascorbate (1 mM ﬁnal concentration), which does not alter the methylated thiols. The free thiols were then bio tiny late d with biotin-hexyl pyr idyl dith io prop ion amide (HPDP) at   ${\mathfrak{Z}}5~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 1 h. Thus, the S-nitro syl a ted cysteines were switched for biotin. In some reaction mixtures, biotin-HPDP was omitted as a negative control. Proteins were precipitated by chilled acetone, and the pellet was re suspended in HENS buffer   $.250~\mathsf{m M}$   Hepes, pH 7.7,  $1\ \mathsf{m M}$   EDTA,   $0.1\,\mathrm{\mum}$   neo cup roi ne,   $1\%$   sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]). Bio tiny late d proteins were precipitated with strep t avid in– agarose (Sigma) and eluted from the beads with a solution containing  $20\,\mathsf{m M}$   Hepes–NaOH, pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and  $100~\mathsf{m M}$   2-mer cap to ethanol.  

# Immuno precipitation and immuno blotting  

Tissue homo gen at es (  $400\,\mu\mathfrak{g}$   of protein) were diluted fourfold with immuno precipitation buffer (  $50\,\mathsf{m M}$   Hepes buffer   $(\mathsf{p}\mathsf{H}\,7.4)$  ) containing   $10\%$   glycerol,   $150~\mathsf{m M}$   NaCl,  $1\%$   Triton   $\mathsf{X}\!\!-\!\!100$  ,   $0.5\%$   Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,   $1\:\mathsf{m M}$   phenyl methyl s ulf on yl ﬂuoride, and 1 mM  $\mathsf{N a}_{3}\mathsf{V O}_{4},$  ). Samples were pre incubated for 1 h with  $20\;\mu|$   of protein A-sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Bioscience s,

The super nat ants were incubated with   $1{-}2\,\mu\mathfrak{g}$   of primary antibodies for  $4\,\mathsf{h}$   or overnight at  $4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Protein A was added to the tube for another  $^{2\textsf{h}}$   incubation. Samples were centrifuged at   $10{,}000{\times}g$   for   $_{2\;\mathsf{m i n}}$   at  $4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , and the pellets were washed three times with immuno pre ci pitation buffer.

The super nat ants were separated on polyacrylamide gels and then electro transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Bioscience s, Buckinghamshire, UK). After blocking for  $3\,\mathsf{h}$   in Tris-buffered saline with  $0.1\%$   Tween 20 (TBST) and  $3\%$   bovine serum albumin, membranes were incubated overnight at  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   with primary antibodies in TBST containing  $3\%$   bovine serum albumin. Membranes were then washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBST for  $_{2\,\mathsf{h}}$   and developed using NBT/BCIP color substrate (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The density of the bands on the membrane was scanned and analyzed with LabWorks image analysis software (UVP, Inc.).

To investigate whether GluR6 could be S-nitro syl a ted and further test the alternation of S-nitro syl a ted GluR6 at different time points after reperfusion, we examined the time course of GluR6 S-nitro syl ation. As shown in  Fig. 1 A and B, GluR6 was S-nitro syl a ted, the level of which signiﬁ- cantly elevated at 3 h, 6 h,   $\sf{12\,h}$   and 1 day of reperfusion and recovered at 2 days. It is known that the formation of S-nitro syl ation needs NO. In order to elucidate whether S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 was induced by endogenous NO, we applied the inhibitors of NOS. Since nNOS and iNOS are the main NO synthase existed in brain during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion, herein, both 7-NI (nNOS inhibitor) and AMT (iNOS inhibitor) were used. As shown in  Fig. 1 C and D, administration of 7-NI markedly suppressed S-nitrosylation of GluR6, but treatment with AMT was ineffective. Beside the effect of nNOS-derived endogenous NO, we investigated whether exogenous NO also inﬂuenced S-nitrosylation of GluR6. Thus, an exogenous NO donor (SNP) was administered to observe its effect on S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 at   $6~\mathsf{h}$   of reperfusion. Results of Western blotting revealed that treatment with SNP reduced S-nitro syl ation of GluR6, which could be reversed by co-application with DTT. Moreover, DTT alone was applied to prevent S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 as a negative control ( Fig. 1 E and F). Much evidence shows that brain ischemia–reperfusion promotes the assembling of NMDAR and nNOS with PSD95. Thus, we administered the antagonist of NMDAR (KT) to observe whether S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 was also mediated by NMDAR. Our results showed that S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 was suppressed by the treatment with KT ( Fig. 1 G and H). These results suggest that NMDAR ● PSD95 ● nNOS signaling module is

probably involved in GluR6 S-nitro syl ation which is mediated mainly by nNOS but not iNOS.  

# Exogenous NO elevated S-nitro syl ation and phosphor yl ation of nNOS during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion  

As mentioned above, studies have indicated that the activation of nNOS was induced by the reduction of both phosphorylation and S-nitro syl ation of nNOS. Here, we tested S-nitro syl ation and phosphor yl ation of nNOS at various time points of reperfusion ( Fig. 2 A and B). The results showed that phosphor yl ation of nNOS made no signiﬁcant change at  $6\,\mathsf{h}$  and   $\sf{12\,h}$   of reperfusion compared with sham operation, but S-nitro syl ation of nNOS dramatically decreased at the same time point of reperfusion. This indirectly reﬂected that the activation of nNOS could remarkably increase at 6 h and  $\sf{12\,h}$  of reperfusion, and there was no signiﬁcant different between them. Moreover, the activation might have a further increase at 1 day of reperfusion, with a secondary decline at 2 days of reperfusion. Since phosphor yl ation of nNOS from 0 to  $3\,\mathsf{h}$   led to a decreased activation of nNOS, which was contrary to S-nitro syl ation of nNOS, we could not conclude whether it is activated during this period of reperfusion. To further investigate the effect of exogenous NO on the activation of nNOS, SNP was treated. As shown in  Fig. 2 C and D, administration of SNP sign i cant ly increased S-nitro syl ation and phosphorylation of nNOS, reversed by co-application with DTT. Since DTT can effectively remove the thiol-bound NO groups from proteins, the negative controls were performed with DTT alone to prevent S-nitro syl ation of nNOS. These results suggest that exogenous NO may suppress the activation of nNOS, which is embodied by the increased S-nitro syl ation and phosphor yl ation of nNOS.  

# Exogenous NO attenuated the increased assembling of GluR6 ● PSD95 ● MLK3 signaling module via suppressing the increased S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 during ischemia–reperfusion  

As shown in  Fig. 1 E and F, treatment with SNP reduced the increased S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 which was induced by cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. Previous studies indicated that regulation of GluR6 could further inﬂuence the assembling of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95. We then analyzed the effects of SNP on the assembling of GluR6 ● PSD95 ● MLK3 signaling module. As indicated in  Fig. 3 A and B, treatment with SNP diminished the combination of GluR6 and MLK3 as well as PSD95. These results indicate that SNP attenuates the combination of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95 through down-regulating S-nitro syl ation of GluR6, and further suggest that S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 regulates the assembling of GluR6 ● PSD95 ● MLK3 signaling module.  

# MLK3 ● mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 4/7 (MKK4/7) ● JNK signaling module was involved in the signaling pathway caused by GluR6 S-nitro syl ation  

To demonstrate whether GluR6 downstream proteins were also affected by S-nitro syl ation of GluR6, SNP was injected to observe the variation of phosphor y late d downstream proteins. The activation of JNK3 peaks at 30 min and 3 days during brain ischemia–reperfusion, and the latter peak is considered to account for apoptosis. Thus, the time point of 1 day of reperfusion was chosen here to investigate the activation of JNK3, based on that after 2–3 days of reperfusion cell death had happened in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. As indicated in  Fig. 4 A–D, results showed that SNP inhibited p-MLK3, p-MKK4, pMKK7 and p-JNK3, which could be reversed by co-treatment with DTT, while the protein expression of MLK3, MKK4, MKK7 and JNK3 kept unchanged. These results suggest that S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 could affect the phosp hory la tion of its downstream proteins and their activation.  

# JNK-mediated nucleic and mitochondrial pathways were involved in the downstream signaling pathway of GluR6 regulated by its S-nitro syl ation  

To further investigate whether JNK downstream proteins were also inﬂuenced by S-nitro syl ation of GluR6, we examined those proteins by administration of SNP. Since the activation of JNK can activate nucleus substrate c-jun and increase FasL expression, we tested the effect of SNP on them. As shown in  Fig. 5 A and B, p-c-jun and FasL were suppressed by treatment with SNP and reversed by coapplication with DTT. Similar results were observed via immuno his to chemistry ( Fig. 5 C and D). The results conﬁrmed that administration of SNP markedly decreased the immuno activity of p-c-jun and FasL in the nucleus of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer, in contrast to  $6\,\mathsf{h}$   of reperfusion groups and the saline treatment groups, whereas co-treatment SNP with DTT did not show obvious change in immuno activity, in comparison with 6 h of reperfusion or saline groups. It is well known that, after translocation to mitochondrial, p-Bcl-2 increases the release of cytochrome c from mitochondrial to cytosol. Therefore, cytochrome c and JNK non-nucleus substrate (Bcl-2) were examined to further conﬁrm the results. Herein, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) was detected to preclude the participation of other mitochondrial protein. As shown in Fig. 5 E and F, administration of SNP suppressed the phosp hory la tion of Bcl-2, which was reversed by co-treatment with DTT. Moreover, SNP inhibited the release of cytochrome c to cytosol at   $6\,\mathsf{h}$   of reperfusion, contrasted to the remarkably increase in the cytosol at  $6~\mathsf{h}$   of reperfusion. However, co-application of SNP with DTT antagonized the effect of SNP ( Fig. 5 E and F). COXIV was found to exist

Data are means  $\pm S.D$  . from four independent experiments  $(\mathsf{n}\!\!=\!\!4)$  . (a)  $P{<}0.05$   versus sham; (b)  $P{<}0.05$   versus saline groups.

only in the mitochondrial fraction but not in the cytosol. These results indicate that SNP down-regulates the JNK downstream pathway, which is probably caused by the reduced S-nitro syl ation of GluR6.  

# Treatment with SNP exerted a neuro protective effect against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury  

To conﬁrm the neuro protection of SNP on the reperfusion injury, histology analysis was performed. The cell death pathway can be either caspase independent necrosis or caspase dependent apoptosis, counting on the intensity of ex ci to toxic injuries ( Lipton, 1999 ) Here, we tested the cleaved caspase-3. The results showed that SNP attenuated ischemia-induced increase of caspase-3 at 6 h of reperfusion, which was antagonized by co-application of SNP with DTT ( Fig. 6 A and B). TUNEL staining was performed to further examine the role of SNP in ischemiainduced apoptosis. As indicated in  Fig. 6 C, a great quantity of TUNEL-positive cells was observed 3 days after reperfusion ( Fig. 6 b, g). Treatment with SNP sign i cant ly reduced TUNEL-positive cells ( Fig. 6 d, i). However, administration of saline ( Fig. 6 c, h), or co-treatment with SNP with DTT ( Fig. 6 e, j), did not show any protection. Furthermore, Cresyl Violet staining was used to test the survival of hippo camp al CA1 pyramidal cells. Those cells with round and pale stained nuclei were counted as normal ones, whereas those shrunken cells with pyknotic nuclei were regarded as dead ones. As shown in  Fig. 7  min of ischemia followed by 5 days of reperfusion led to severe cell death ( Fig. 7 b, g). Administration of SNP dramatically decreased the neuronal degeneration ( Fig. 7 c, h), which was abolished by treatment combined with DTT ( Fig. 7 e, j). At the same time, saline control did not show any protection ( Fig. 7 c, h). The numbers of surviving pyramidal cells in CA1 region of sham operation group, ischemia insult group, saline treatment group, SNP treatment group and co-application of SNP with DTT group were  $209.2{\scriptstyle\pm8.8}$  ,  $15.5{\pm}5.3$  ,   $14.2\pm4.2$  ,   $152.3{\scriptstyle\pm6.6}$   and   $15.5{\pm}4.9$  , respec- tively ( Fig. 7 B).  

# DISCUSSION  

From the above results, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that GluR6 can be S-nitro syl a ted. The possible molecular mechanism exhibits that, as shown in  Fig. 8 , during the early stages of brain ischemia–reperfusion, nNOS-derived NO facilitates GluR6 S-nitro syl ation, and further upregulates the increased assembling of GluR6 ● PSD95 ● MLK3 signaling module, leading to the further activation of JNK signaling pathway. Furthermore, current study also indicates that, during the early ischemia–reperfusion injury, endogenous NO is probably generated mainly from nNOS but not iNOS and is possibly mediated by NMDAR ● PSD95 ● nNOS signaling module. However, administration of exogenous NO donor may antagonize the effect of endogenous NO which generated mostly from nNOS, leading to the reduction of GluR6 S-nitro syl ation via suppressing nNOS. This indicates the coupling between nNOS and GluR6 mediated by S-nitro syl ation. Moreover, the decreased S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 is followed by the diminished combination of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95, the down regulation of JNK signaling pathway and, as a result, the protection against apoptosis in hippo camp al CA1 induced by brain ischemia.  

Since endogenous NO derives from NOS during ischemia–reperfusion and correlates with the activity of NOS, we wonder what is responsible for the activation of NOS. It is well established that phosphor yl ation of NOS reduces its activity ( Hayashi et al., 1999; Komeima et al., 2000 ) and S-nitro syl ation of NOS also inhibits its activity ( Abu-Soud et al., 1995 ). In brain, both nNOS and iNOS are known to exist. It is demonstrated that nNOS is continuously activated and produces NO during the early stages of cerebral ischemia, contributing to neuronal death beginning at 6–12 h of post-reperfusion until nNOS is in activated. However, iNOS, whose protein expression and catalytic activity are detectable   $\sf{12~h}$   after cerebral ischemia, produces an ex- cessive amount of NO in the late stages of ischemia, up regulates global ischemia insult peaking at 2 days after reperfusion and returns to baseline in 7 days ( Samdani et al., 1997; Otani et al., 2004; Keynes and Garthwaite, 2004 ). In the current study, we examined the time course of nNOS phosphor yl ation as well as S-nitro syl ation in global cerebral ischemia. This enabled the presumption of the activation of nNOS at various time points of reperfusion. The results could indirectly reﬂect the obvious activation of nNOS and the probably increased production of NO at   $6~\mathsf{h}$   of reperfusion. The activation might have a further increase at 1 day of reperfusion and be reversed at 2 days. For the reverse at 2 days of reperfusion, it is possible that the overproduction of NO has a further inhibition of the activity of the enzyme (nNOS). Our results also showed that S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 changed following different time points of reperfusion, which began to elevate at  $6~\mathsf{h}$   of reperfusion and decreased at 2 days of reperfusion. These results prompted the assumption that S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 was related with the activation of nNOS and the following production of NO from nNOS during the early stages of cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. Accordingly, in order to research nNOS in ischemic brain injury without being interrupted by iNOS, the time point of 6 h was adopted in this research. However, it shows that nNOS is more nitro syl a ted in the physiological condition than in the pathological condition. It is reported that GSNO is present in the brain at micromolar concentrations and may serve as an endogenous reservoir of NO group ( Inaba et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2006 ). As a physiological NO donor, GSNO, may be the cause of a physiological high level of nitro syl a ted nNOS. Meanwhile, at  $6~\mathsf{h}$   of reperfusion, we can observe that nNOS is less S-nitro syl a ted while GluR6 is more. Although this S-nitro syl ation may be due to the NO derived from nNOS, the levels of nitrosylation are regulated not only by enzymes that add NO groups but also by enzymatic mechanisms that remove them ( Stamler et al., 2001 ). However, the interaction of nNOS S-nitro syl ation and phosphor yl ation remains unknown and additional studies are needed to investigate the bioactivity of nNOS during the early ischemia–reperfusion.

An exogenous NO donor (SNP) plays a dual role of neuro protection and neuro toxicity in cerebral ischemia. It is reported in the early researches that SNP protects ischemic territory by increasing cerebral blood ﬂow ( Zhang and

Fig. 8.  Schematic model providing a possible mechanism for the coupling between nNOS and GluR6-mediated JNK signaling pathway via S-nitro syl ation induced by the early stages of cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. Brain ischemia–reperfusion activates nNOS and may further enhance the release of NO. Simultaneously, the increased production of NO facilitates S-nitro syl ation of GluR6, which results in the up regulation of the activated GluR6, leading to the further assembling of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95 and the activation of the JNK downstream signaling pathway. However, an NO donor (SNP) may inhibit the activation of nNOS and reduce the generation of NO from nNOS as well as S-nitro syl ation of GluR6, which subsequently inhibits the assembling of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95; nNOS inhibitor (7-NI), NMDAR inhibitor (KT) and sulfhydryl-reducing regent (DTT) can also attenuate S-nitro syl ation of GluR6 through different approaches. The above demonstrates that possible coupling existed between nNOS and GluR6 via S-nitro syl ation during the early stages of reperfusion.  

Iadecola, 1993; Zhang et al., 1994; Chi et al., 1995 ). Re- cently, some reports have showed that, as a spontaneous NO donor, the administration of SNP induces apoptosis in cultured cells ( Bastia net to et al., 2000; Sheng and Liu, 2003; Jung et al., 2007 ), on the contrary, some have reported that SNP up regulates neuronal survival during brain ischemia insults ( Salom et al., 2000; Yamagata et al., 2006 ). In the current study, treatment with SNP inhibited neuronal apoptosis and improved pyramidal neuronal survival in rat hippo camp al CA1 during cerebral ischemia injury. Although SNP is a potent va so dil at or, its effect can be sustained less than 15 min and the action is in suf cie nt to inﬂuence our test. In clinical application, SNP has been mainly used as a medicine for hypertension. Herein, we prefer the therapeutic action of SNP on cerebral ischemia. It is reported that inhaled NO inhibits eNOS activity  in vivo in the intact lamb ( Black et al., 1999 ), NO donor SNP treatment produces a signiﬁcant decrease in eNOS activity ( Sheehy et al., 1998 ), exogenous NO or NO-donor de- pressed nNOS activity in rat cerebellum ( Rogers and Ignarro, 1992 ) and iNOS activity is inhibited by NO in rat alveolar macrophages ( Griscavage et al., 1993 ). These researches have shown that NOS activity can be depressed by exogenous NO. Similarly, in this study, we demonstrated that SNP enhanced S-nitro syl ation and phosphor yl ation of nNOS during the early stages of rat global ischemia–reperfusion. We wonder how SNP increases phosphor yl ation of nNOS. The reason may be: 1) it is reported that phosphor yl ation of nNOS at Ser847 is induced by endogenous CaMK II in rat hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia. Treatment with SNP may enhance the activity of CaMK II and facilitate CaMK IImediated nNOS phosphor yl ation; 2) since both protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A can dephosphorylate nNOS, SNP may also increase the phosphorylation of nNOS by inhibiting them; 3) it is possible that treatment with SNP increases the interaction of nNOS with PSD95 and further enhances nNOS phosphor yl ation. The protective mechanism of SNP may be that NOS contains two haems and NO acts as a negative feedback modulator of NOS, through its binding to the haem of NOS ( Assreuy et al., 1993; Abu-Soud et al., 1996; Gorren et al., 2000 ). As expected, treatment with SNP did not increase S-nitrosylation of GluR6 but had an inhibited role at 6 h of reperfusion. This suggests that, on the one hand, SNP might reduce the production of endogenous NO by increasing S-nitro syl ation and phosphor yl ation of nNOS; on the other hand, the decreased endogenous NO could lead to the reduced S-nitro syl ation of GluR6.  

DTT, a sulfhydryl-reducing regent, can reduce the di- sulﬁde bonds to free thiol groups. Considerable evidence has showed that DTT can inhibit the action of SNP ( Hammarström and Gage, 1999; Hada et al., 2000; Ryu et al., 2004; Sardar et al., 2006 ). Here, we demonstrated that DTT reversed the neuro protection of SNP during brain ischemia damage. As we know, SNP is an oxidizing agent while DTT is a chemical reducing agent. In our research, the effect of SNP is embodied in S-nitro syl ation and phosp hory la tion of nNOS. Since DTT can exert its effect on both S-S and S-NO adducts, exogenous NO-mediated S-nitro syl ation can be reversed by DTT. Thus, in the results we can observe that DTT can reverse the increased nNOS S-nitro syl ation induced by SNP. However, as stated above, we can only presume the possible mechanism that SNP increase phosphor yl ation of nNOS. So, we still do not know how DTT reverse exogenous NO-mediated phosp hory la tion.  

Our previous researches have demonstrated that brain ischemia–reperfusion can promote the assembling of the GluR6 ● PSD95 ● MLK3 signaling module. Therein, TatGluR6-9c or GluR6 antisense ODNs show a protective role by down regulating the combination of GluR6, PSD95 and MLK3 ( Pei et al., 2005, 2006 ). According to this, we consider that GluR6 is the vital protein to be regulated. In this study, we showed that in ischemia–reperfusion GluR6 was more S-nitro syl a ted which was followed by the increased assembling of GluR6 ● PSD95 ● MLK3 signaling module, leading to the changes of the downstream proteins toward apoptosis pathway. This enables us to consider that Snitro syl ation of GluR6 may be an important mechanism to regulate the combination of GluR6 and MLK3 with PSD95. Therefore, the modi cation of GluR6 by S-nitro syl ation will provide a possible therapeutic approach for ischemic brain damage. Further studies will be needed to identify the active cysteine sites of GluR6 and investigate the activity of GluR6 after being S-nitro syl a ted. These will be performed in our laboratory.  

In this study, GluR6 downstream proteins involved in apoptosis pathway were also tested to further elucidate the signaling pathway. Previous ﬁndings have established that in the apoptosis pathway the downstream proteins which are involved in the current study can be S-nitro syl a ted. It is reported that exogenous ly or endogenous ly produced NO can suppress the activation of JNK via S-nitro syl ation ( Park et al., 2000 ). Meanwhile, similar reports have been found in c-Jun ( delaTorre et al., 1998 ), Bcl-2 ( Azad et al., 2006 ) and caspase-3 ( Tenneti et al., 1997 ). In this study, we showed that SNP down-regulated neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the increased phosphor yl ation of JNK, c-Jun and Bcl-2. There is evidence which shows that temporary local provision of NO via donors is demonstrated to inhibit apoptosis in many cells ( Kim et al., 1997 ). However, they exhibit a totally different mechanism from ours. Thus, in our laboratory we have investigated these downstream proteins when they are modiﬁed by S-nitro syl ation during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion, with or without the treatment with SNP.
