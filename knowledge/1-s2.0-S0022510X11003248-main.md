Background:  Kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR), a type 2 vascular endo the li al growth factor receptor, plays a crucial role in ang io genesis and vascular integrity of blood vessels. We evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotype of kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the Korean population. Methods:  Totals of 501 patients with ischemic stroke and 478 controls were screened for the KDR    ${\mathrm{-}604}\,\mathrm{T\!>\!}\mathsf{C},$   $+\,1\,192\;\mathsf{G}\!>\!\mathsf{A},$  , and  $+\,1719\mathsf{A}\!>\!\mathrm{T}$   SNPs. Subgroup analysis was performed to determine whether the effect of KDR polymorphism is speci ﬁ c to certain e tio logical subtypes of ischemic stroke. In addition, haplotype frequencies of these three SNPs were analyzed in stroke patients and controls. Results:  The  ${\mathsf{S N P}}+1719\Gamma$   allele was associated with risk of ischemic stroke in a dose-dependent manner (TT vs. AA: adjusted OR: 1.90,  $95\%$   CIs: 1.29 – 2.81,  $\mathsf{p\!=\!}0.001$   and false discovery rate   $(\mathrm{FDR})\,{=}\,0.003.$  ). Subgroup analysis showed that the  ${\mathsf{S N P}}+1719\Gamma$   allele had a slight but signi ﬁ cant association with small vessel disease type (TT vs. AA: adjusted OR: 1.91,  $95\%$   CIs: 1.11 – 3.29,  $p\!=\!0.02$  ). There was no association between  $\mathrm{SNR}-604$  and  $\mathsf{S N P}+1192$   and ischemic stroke risk. In haplotype analysis, the T-G-T   $(-604/+1192/+1719)$  ), T-A-T, and C-G-T haplotypes increased the relative risk of ischemic stroke. Conclusions:  The   $\mathrm{KDR}+1719\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{T}$  polymorphism and its haplotypes are possible genetic determinants for the risk of ischemic stroke.

in cerebral vas cula ture  [5,6] . Vascular endo the li al growth factor (VEGF) plays a crucial role in the maintenance of endo the li al integrity and the physiological function of endothelium via endo the li al repair, endo the li al survival, and its anti a pop to tic effects. VEGF binds to two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1, also called Flt-1) and VEGF receptor 2, also called kinase insert domain-containing receptor/fetal liver kinase-1 (KDR). In endo the li al cells and endothelial progenitor cells, KDR is the main receptor for VEGF  [7] . Binding of VEGF to KDR leads to multiple signaling cascades, affecting angiogenesis, endo the li al survival, proliferation, and migration  [8] . Recently, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VEGF gene have been associated with cancer risk and prognosis  [9] , DM ret in opa thy  [10] , and coronary arterial disease  [11] , indicating the importance of the VEGF-KDR signaling pathway in human disease. In addition, several SNPs of KDR are known to alter the activity of the VEGF-KDR signaling pathway. The minor C allele of SNP    $-604\,\mathrm{T}{>}\mathsf{C}$  (rs2071559), which is located in the promoter region of the KDR gene, leads to decreased promoter activity. The minor A allele of SNP  $+\,1192$   (rs2305948) in exon 7 and the minor T allele of   $\mathsf{S N P}+1719$  (rs1870377) in exon 11 lead to amino acid substitutions and reduce binding af ﬁ nity of VEGF to KDR.  

# 1. Introduction  

Ischemic stroke is one of the most complex disorders with diverse etiologies. Advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, hyper lipid emi a, and cardiac disease are well-established risk factors, but one-third of stroke patients have no con ﬁ rmed etiology  [1] . Therefore, genetic and environmental backgrounds likely play a role in the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke. However, there is no single genetic variant responsible for ischemic stroke. Recent genome-wide association studies have failed to con ﬁ rm the associations of candidate genes, and novel loci of interest could not be replicated in other studies  [2 – 4] . These observations indicate that ischemic stroke probably results from many susceptibility genes with small effects, environmental factors, and their complex interactions.  

Emerging evidence suggests that endo the li al dysfunction is important in the pathogen es is of atherosclerosis and micro an gi opa thy  

Alterations in receptor functions caused by SNPs or haplotypes of KDR gene may in ﬂ uence clinical vascular diseases, such as cardiovascular and cerebro vascular disease. Recent case-control studies in the Chinese population found signi ﬁ cant associations between several SNPs of the KDR gene and the risk for coronary arterial disease  [12] and ischemic stroke  [13] . The aim of the present study was to investigate whether SNPs and haplotypes of the KDR gene confer risk for ischemic stroke and individual etiologic stroke subtypes in the Korean population.  

# 2. Methods  

# 2.1. Study population  

Patients were enrolled from March 2003 to June 2008 at the Department of Neurology at CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University by consecutive referral. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at CHA Bundang Medical Center approved the study protocol. A total of 501 patients (mean age±SD:  $63\pm11$   years, men:  $58.7\%,$  ) with ischemic stroke were enrolled. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed by rapidly developing neurological symptoms and concurrent acute infarction documented by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 478 subjects without any history of neurological disorders were enrolled as controls (mean   $\mathsf{a g e\pm S D}$  :   $62\pm11$   years, men:  $53.6\%$  ). Control subjects consisted of those who visited the hospital for routine health examination, non-speci ﬁ c dizziness, non-organic headache, or anxiety for positive family history of stroke during the enrollment period. All control subjects had brain imaging (approximately  $75\%$   of controls underwent brain MRI), and were found to have no organic cerebral lesions. Clinical information regarding demographic data and vascular risk factors was collected by personal interview. Subjects with a previous history of cerebral hemorrhage or with unobtainable information were excluded from this study.  

# 2.2. Risk factor assessment and ischemic stroke classi ﬁ cation  

Hypertension was diagnosed when a patient had a high baseline blood pressure (systolic  $:\geq140\:\mathrm{mmHg}$   or diastolic  $\geq\!90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$  ) on more than one occasion or had an anti hypertensive medication history. DM was diagnosed based on high fasting plasma glucose   $(\geq\!126\:\mathrm{mg/dl})$  ) or an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin treatment history. A positive smoking history was de ﬁ ned as a current smoking status at the time of examination or previous history of heavy smoking habit (  $'\!\ge\!15$   pack years) for ex-smokers. Hyper lipid emi a was de ﬁ ned as a high fasting serum total cholesterol level   $({\geq}240\,\mathrm{mg/dl})$   or history of anti hyper lip idemic treatment. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) was de ﬁ ned as a positive history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or coronary intervention or bypass surgery. Atrial  ﬁ brillation (aﬁ b) was de ﬁ ned as a positive history or current presence of aﬁ b on electrocardiograph y (ECG). All ischemic stroke patients underwent   $1.5\,\mathrm{T}$   brain MRI and ECG. Diffusionweighted imaging was performed in   $89\%$   of the patients. Based on clinical manifestations and neuro imaging data, two neurologists classi ﬁ ed all ischemic strokes into four path o physiological subtypes according to Trial of Org10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classi ﬁ cation  [14] . In the present study, 173 cases   $(34.5\%)$   had largeartery atherosclerosis (LAA), 173 cases   $(34.5\%)$   had small vessel disease (SVD), 62 cases   $(12.3\%)$   had car dio embolism (CE), and the remaining 93 cases   $(18.7\%)$   had undetermined etiology (UD) and other-determined etiology.  

# 2.3. Genetic analyses of KDR  – 604  $T{>}C,$     $+\,1\,192\,G{>}A,$  , and   $+1719A{>}T$  polymorphisms  

DNA was extracted using theG-DEX blood extraction kit (Intron,Inc., Seongnam, South Korea). Three well-known SNPs in the KDR gene were identi ﬁ ed by a documentary search, which included one promoter region   $(-604)$   and two coding regions   $(+\,1\,1\,92,\ +\,1\,7\,19)$  . All SNP sequences were obtained from the HapMap database ( http://www. hapmap.org )  [15] . The primers and PCR conditions for KDR polymorphism analyses are described elsewhere  [12] . For  $\mathrm{SNR}-604$  , two DNA fragments of 174 bp and 116 bp were produced for the C allele and one band was produced for the T allele. For the   $+\,1192$   polymorphism, two DNA fragments of 30 bp and 232 bp were produced for the A allele and one band was produced for the G allele. For   ${\mathrm{SNR}}+1719.$  , two DNA fragments of 191 bp and 213 bp were produced for the A allele, and one band was produced for the T allele. Reproducibility of genotyping was con ﬁ rmed by bi-directional sequencing of 400 randomly selected samples, and the results were equal to the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) data.  

# 2.4. Statistical analysis  

To analyze baseline characteristics, we used the    $\chi^{2}$    test for categorical variables (sex, hypertension, DM, hyper lipid emi a, smoking, ischemic heart disease, and aﬁ b) and the Mann – Whitney test for continuous variables (age, blood pressure and routine chemistry) between the stroke group and the control group. Initially, additive, dominant and recessive models of each polymorphism were compared between the stroke group and the control group by the    $\chi^{2}$    test. Odds ratio (ORs) and   $95\%$   con ﬁ dence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the relative risk of ischemic stroke conferred by each polymorphism. The adjusted ORs were determined from multiple logistic regression analyses using age, sex, hypertension, DM, hyperlipidemia, smoking, IHD, and aﬁ b. The false discovery rate (FDR) correction was set to no more than   $5\%$   false positive for multiple comparison tests   $\!\!\mathrm{FDR}\!\!<\!0.05.$  ). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (version 11.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and Stats Direct Statistical Software (version 2.4.4, Stats Direct Ltd, Altrincham, UK). The linkage d is equilibrium (LD) between loci was measured using the absolute value of Lewontin's D ′ . Haplotype frequencies for multiple loci were estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with SNPAlyze (version 5.1; DYNACOM Co., Ltd., [ http://www.dynacom. co.jp/], Yokohama, Japan).  

# 3. Results  

Demographic characteristics of the stroke and control groups are summarized in  Table 1 . The stroke group had a signi ﬁ cantly higher prevalence of hypertension, hyper lipid emi a, DM, and aﬁ b (all  $p$  values  $<$  0.05). The genotype distributions of all tested polymorphisms did not deviate from the expected proportions, based on Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in either group. We used the data to determine the LD pattern for KDR polymorphisms at  $\mathrm{{SNR}}-604\,(\mathrm{{rs}}2071559)/+1192$   $(\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}2305948)/\mathrm{\Omega}+1719$   (rs1870377) ( Fig. 1 ). There was moderate LD between loci   $+\,1192$   and   $+\,1719$   (  $\mathrm{{}.D^{\prime}\!=\!0.735.}$  ) in the study population ( Fig. 1 ). In control subjects, the minor allelic frequencies were 0.29 for

the SNP  −  ${\mathsf{S N P}}+1192\,P$   ${\mathsf{S N P}}+1719\Gamma$   allele. The allelic frequency of  $-604C$   is known to be lower in Asian populations than in Western populations, while the allelic frequencies of the  $+\,1\,192\,\mathrm{A}$   and  $+\,1719\mathrm{T}$   alleles are known to be similar between the two races (HapMap database ( http://www.hapmap.org ) [15] . This pattern was observed in our Korean data; that is, the allelic frequencies of three tested SNPs in the Korean population were within the range of other Asian populations  [12,13] .  

The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of the  ${\mathsf{S N P}}+1719\Gamma$   allele in stroke patients was signi ﬁ cantly higher in heterozygous additive (AA vs. AT, OR: 1.38,   $95\%$   CIs: 1.01 – 1.89), homozygous additive (AA vs. TT, OR: 1.90,  $95\%$   CIs: 1.29 – 2.81), dominant (OR: 1.50,   $95\%$   CIs: 1.12 – 2.03), and recessive models (OR: 1.56,   $95\%$   CIs: 1.12 – 2.17) than in controls ( Table 2 ). These associations remained statistically signi ﬁ cant after multiple comparison tests (FDR    $p$   value  ${<}0.05$  ) in all models, except the heterozygous additive model. The various logistic regression models showed that no interaction exists between   $\mathtt{S N P}+1719$   and any of the vascular risk factors (data not shown). When each vascular risk factor was strati ﬁ ed, additive effects were found between SNP  $+\,1719$   and each vascular risk factor for stroke ( Table 3 ). Contrary to S  $\mathrm{NP}+1719$  , SNP  − 604 and SNP   $+\,1192$   were not associated with stroke risk.  

We further investigate the genotype frequencies of the three SNPs of KDR in LAA and SVD-type stroke, according to TOAST classi ﬁ cation,

since SNPs would be expected to have differing effects on two etiologic stroke subtypes. The homozygous additive model (AA vs. TT, OR: 1.91,   $95\%$   $\%\ {\sf C l s}\!=\!1.11\!-\!3.29)$  ) of the   ${\mathsf{S N P}}+1719\Gamma$   allele showed a slight but signi ﬁ cant association with the SVD-type ( Table 4 ).  

In haplotype analysis, the T-G-A   $(-604/+1192/+1719)$   was the most frequent haplotype in the controls and stroke patients. Compared to controls, stroke patients had high frequencies of T-G-T (OR: 1.3  $35,95\%\,{\tt C I s}\!=\!1.07\!-\!1.69$  ), T-A-T (OR: 1.68,  $95\%\,\mathrm{Cs}\!=\!1.09\!-\!2.59$  ), and C-G-T (OR: 1.46,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CIs}\,{=}\,1.08\!-\!1.98.$  ) haplotypes. In subgroup analysis, the C-G-T haplotype was signi ﬁ cantly associated with the SVD-type (OR: 1.65,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I s}\,{=}\,1.11{-}2.45\,,$  ) ( Table 5 ).

ischemic stroke in the Korean population. The major  ﬁ nding was that the   ${\mathsf{S N P}}+1719\Gamma$   allele conferred risk for ischemic stroke in a dosedependent manner. This association remained signi ﬁ cant after adjusting for confounding factors for stroke, indicating the SNP  $+\,1719\mathrm{T}$   allele may serve as a candidate SNP for ischemic stroke risk. To our knowledge, no other studies have evaluated  $\mathsf{S N P}+1719$   of the KDR gene in ischemic stroke. In another case-control study for coronary arterial disease, a positive association between   $\mathrm{SNR}+1719$  and coronary arterial disease was observed  [12] , which supports an association between SNP   $+\,1719$   and clinical vascular disease. The polymorphic site of  $\mathsf{S N P}+1719$   is located in exon 11, which encodes the key element of the KDR binding domain for VEGF. Regarding SNP  $-\,604$   and SNP   $+\,1192$  , there are some discrepancies between our data and a previous case-control study in the Chinese population. Zhang et al.  [13]  showed that the  ${\mathrm{Nup-604C}}$   allele protects against a the roth rom bot ic stroke, but our data revealed no association between them. This inconsistency is dif ﬁ cult to explain, but differences in the study design, sample size, and genetic background with geneenvironmental interaction between two populations could be possible explanations.  

Experimental studies have shown that the SNP  − 604C allele decreases KDR promoter activity, while the   ${\mathsf{S N P}}+1192\,\mathsf{A\,a n d}+1719\Gamma$  alleles decrease the VEGF binding af ﬁ nity for KDR  [12] . Based on these  ﬁ ndings, we postulate that the minor  $+\,1719\mathrm{T}$   allele increases ischemic stroke risk via decreased binding capacity of VEGF to KDR. However, it remains debatable whether the VEGF-KDR pathway is protective or harmful to blood vessels. Several observations suggest that increased VEGF-KDR signaling aggravates atherosclerosis through neo vascular iz ation and in ﬂ ammation in atheromatous plaques [16,17] . On the other hand, others suggest that the VEGF-KDR pathway has protective effects on vascular endothelium via the enhanced survival of endo the li al cells  [18 – 20]  and vascular repair of damaged endothelium  [21,22] . An animal study has shown that de ﬁ ciency of the KDR gene results in disrupted endo the li al cell development and defective blood vessel formation  [23] . It is reasonable to speculate that decreased VEGF-KDR signaling is causative rather than protective in clinical vascular disease risk, considering its essential role in the maintenance of physiological ang io genesis and vascular integrity. Even if decreased KDR activity reduces atherosclerosis progression to some extents, its protective effect could not overwhelm the detrimental effect on blood vessels, such as defective physiological ang io genesis and impaired repair processes at damaged vessels. This speculation is supported by a study by Wang et al.  [12] , who demonstrated that minor alleles of   ${\mathrm{SNR}}-604,\,+\,1192$  , and   $+\,1719$  conferred a 1.3 – 1.8 fold risk of coronary arterial disease. This  ﬁ nding indicates that decreased activity of the VEGF-KDR pathway due to KDR polymorphism may increase the risk of at hero thrombosis in coronary arteries.  

In subgroup analysis of associations between KDR polymorphisms and individual stroke subtype, a slight but signi ﬁ cant association was found between  $\mathrm{SNR}+1719$   and SVD-type stroke. We postulate that altered binding capacity of VEGF caused by KDR polymorphism decreases the integrity of vascular endothelium and inhibits endothelial repair, eventually leading to cerebral small arterial occlusion. Accumulating evidence suggests that endo the li al dysfunction is one of the main pathogen ese s of SVD, including lacunar infarction  [6] . The exact mechanism behind the differential effect of KDR polymorphism on SVD-type stroke is obscure. One possible explanation is that differing pathological origins for SVD and LAA-type stroke may contribute to the disparate biological impact of KDR polymorphism. The pathological foundations of the SVD-type are micro a the roma and lip oh ya lino s is of small perforating artery  [24] , which are different from the LAA-type. Another possible explanation is differences in the anatomical distribution of KDR between major cranial arteries and perforating arteries, which could result in different clinical impacts between coronary disease and ischemic stroke. Additional biochemical studies are required to clarify the functional mechanism of KDR in the cerebral micro circulation system. We initially hypothesized that the SNP   $+\,1719$   polymorphism would be strongly associated with LAA-type stroke, given the fact that this SNP is reported to be associated with coronary arterial disease  [12] , the path o mechanism of which is similar to that of LAA-type. The unexpected result is dif ﬁ cult to explain. One possible explanation is that intra cranial and extra cranial atherosclerosis in LAA-type stroke have different patho physiological bases  [25] , and that the path o mechanism of coronary artery atherosclerosis is similar to that of extra cranial artery disease [26,27] . Therefore, path o physiological heterogeneity of LAA-type may be attributable to the lack of association between KDR gene polymorphism and LAA-type stroke. Further study will be required

to clarify the differential effect of KDR on large-diameter cerebral artery and cerebral perforating arteries.  

The limitations of the present study should be addressed. First, our data must be interpreted with caution because of the limited sample size, especially in the subgroup analysis. Moreover, the absence of a replication study with independent samples, which is normally a requirement for a candidate gene association study, is one of the major limitations in the present study. Our data should be replicated in future studies with larger sample sizes before  ﬁ rm conclusion are drawn. However, we think that our subgroup data could provide valuable information regarding an  ‘ association pattern ’ , rather than a ‘ de ﬁ nite casualty ’  between KDR polymorphism for each stroke subtype. Second, our results cannot be extrapolated to other races owing to inter ethnic variability in SNP and haplotype frequency  [15] . Moreover, the prevalence of stroke subtypes in the Asian population differs from that in the Caucasian population  [28] . Third, controls were not entirely  ‘ healthy ’  subjects since some of them sought medical attention. Our results might underestimate the true impact of individual risk factors and might affect the result of genotypephenotype associations. Although a population-based study is needed to overcome this bias, recruitment of healthy participants with imaging and laboratory tests would markedly reduce the enrollment rate.  

In conclusion,  $\mathrm{SNR}+1719$   of the KDR gene and its haplotypes were associated with the risk of ischemic stroke. A slight but signi ﬁ cant association between KDR polymorphism and SVD-type should be replicated in future clinical and biochemical studies.
