Background:  Stroke is a multi-factorial disorder and has become the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identi ﬁ ed a signi ﬁ cant association of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2107595 in  HDAC9  gene with large-vessel ischaemic stroke (IS) in the European populations. The aim of this study is to examine the association of  HDAC9  gene rs2107595 polymorphism with the susceptibility of IS in southern Han Chinese.  

Methods:  A case-control study was conducted in Chinese Han population, with a total of 1632 subjects including 816 stroke patients and 816 controls. Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX was used to genotype the SNP rs2107595 in HDAC9  gene. Genetic association analysis between genotypes and risk of IS was evaluated by PLINK program. Results:  No signi ﬁ cant association was found between the SNP rs2107595 and IS in the additive, dominant, recessive and allelic models (all  $p>0.050)$  ). For IS-related quantitative traits in the sex-strati ﬁ ed analysis, the results showed a signi ﬁ cant association between rs2107595 and serum TG level of males in the additive model   $\dot{}p_{a d j}=0.008)$   and the dominant model   $\dot{}p_{a d j}=0.003\dot{}$  , and a signi ﬁ cant association of rs2107595 polymorphism with serum TC level of females in the additive model   $'p_{a d j}=0.045.$  ) and the dominant model  $(p_{a d j}=0.037)$  ).  

Conclusions:  Our results indicate that  HDAC9  variant rs2107595 may be not associated with IS risk in southern Han Chinese. However, the rs2107595 polymorphism may be associated with serum TC and TG level of IS patients.

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke is a multi-factorial disorder and has become the leading cause of long-term disability and the second commonest cause of death throughout the world ( Lozano et al., 2012; Moz a ff arian et al., 2014 ). Of all strokes, ischemic stroke (IS) reaches about  $87\%$   ( Donnan et al., 2008 ). Each year, approximately 15 million IS cases are newly diagnosed worldwide, among which there are about 5 million deaths and 5 million disabled people ( Ziganshina et al., 2010 ). In China, the situation is also serious and the annual prevalence rate of stroke is about 170.3 per 100,000 ( Zhao et al., 2012 ). However, the exact pathogenesis of IS has not yet been elucidated. Traditional factors such as hypertension, atrial  ﬁ brillation and smoking constitute an important part of stroke risk ( Nakamura et al., 2012 ), but these factors fail to explain the overall risk. Currently, IS is regarded as a consequence of the combined action of genetic and environmental factors ( Bejot et al., 2007; Della-Morte et al., 2012 ). Research on animal models, twins and families ( Jeffs et al., 1997; Bak et al., 2002; Jerrard-Dunne et al., 2003 ) have been provided strong evidence that genetics play a key role in the incidence of IS.  

Histone de acetyl as e 9 ( HDAC9 ) is a member of the  HDAC  gene family which play an essential role in the alteration of chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation ( Haberland et al., 2009 ). It is reported that HDAC9  might increase stroke risk ( Bellenguez et al., 2012; Han et al., 2013 ), and a polymorphic loci rs2107595 in  HDAC9  gene is identi ﬁ ed being associated with the susceptibility of IS ( Traylor et al., 2012; Dichgans et al., 2014 ). Despite great progress in genetics of IS, few underlying genetic variants have been credibly identi ﬁ ed in association with the susceptibility of IS until now. Fortunately, advances in highthroughput genotyping techniques enable GWAS analysis available to detect novel susceptibility loci, which has rigorous computational and statistical methods. To date, only sixteen GWASs in stroke have been performed ( http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/index.cfm?pageid  $=$  26525384#searchForm ) and a few genetic variants such as  HDAC9 , PITX2  and  ZFHX3  ( Traylor et al., 2012 ) have reached the level of genome-wide signi ﬁ cance. Also, the GWAS-identi ﬁ ed genetic associations need further validation. In 2012, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) GWAS  ﬁ rstly reported  HDAC9  (rs11984041) associated with large-vessel ischaemic stroke in European populations ( Bellenguez et al., 2012 ). However, the HapMap data show that rs11984041 was not polymorphic in Chinese Han population (HapMap-HCB). A replicated study ( Han et al., 2013 ) indicated that the rs11984041 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was not associated with stroke in Chinese population, while a signi ﬁ cant association was found between two other SNPs (rs2389995 and rs2240419) in HDAC9  gene and large-vessel stroke. From this we can see,  HDAC9 gene might contain susceptibility loci in stroke risk, and the distribution of genetic polymorphism on the  HDAC9  gene may have racial difference in different ethnic populations. Excitingly, two subsequent GWASs ( Traylor et al., 2012; Dichgans et al., 2014 ) have revealed that  HDAC9 polymorphism loci rs2107595 is signi ﬁ cantly associated with stroke in European populations. In 2013, a GWAS on stroke in the European population have found that rs2107595 polymorphism is signi ﬁ cantly associated with large-vessel stroke ( Traylor et al., 2012 ). In 2014, the other GWAS on Caucasians also identi ﬁ ed the SNP rs2107595 on HDAC9  conferring a susceptibility not only to IS but also to coronary artery disease ( Dichgans et al., 2014 ). As for the positioning of rs2107595, it is still controversial at present. From METASTROKE ( Traylor et al., 2012 ), we can learn the polymorphism loci rs2107595 resides in the intergenic areas between  HDAC9  and  TWIST1  gene.  Azghandi et al. (2015)  carried out a gene expression study in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the results indicated that rs2107595 only regulated the mRNA level of  HDAC9  but not of  TWIST1 / FERD3L . Hence, rs2107595 is considered more likely in  HDAC9  gene.  

For genetic background may vary from different ethnic populations, the GWAS-identi ﬁ ed positive associations need to be validated in other ethnic groups, however, the association between  HDAC9  variant rs2107595 and IS has not yet been reported in Chinese Han population. In the present study, we undertook a case-control study to examine the association of GWAS-identi ﬁ ed SNP rs2107595 in  HDAC9  gene with the susceptibility of IS in southern Chinese Han population. Moreover, we also evaluated the association between IS-related quantitative traits and IS in the studied population.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. Study subjects  

Our current study was approved by the ethics committee of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine. Eight hundred and sixteen IS subjects were enrolled from the Department of Neurology at First Af ﬁ liated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine between July 2009 to June 2014. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed by two or more neurologists who have physician-in-charge title based on the 4th National Conference on diagnostic criteria for cerebro vascular disease. Also, all IS cases underwent the computed tomography scan (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Exclusion criteria for cases as follows: patients with tumors, brain trauma, car dio embolism, transient ischemic attacks and cerebro vascular malformation; those who had comorbidity, such as in ﬂ ammatory disease, collagen os is or severe heart, liver, renal diseases; ill-matched patients. Eight hundred and sixteen controls were composed of the healthy people from the health checkup center and mild hospitalized patients without neurological diseases from Orthopedics at First Af ﬁ liated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine. Control subjects should not only be matched with

the case group for gender and age, but also have no history of major diseases in the body. Exclusion criteria for controls as follows: those with a history of cardia-cerebro vascular disease, such as stroke, coronary disease; individuals with autoimmune diseases or using hormones or immunosuppressant s; insubordinate individuals. A total of 1632 subjects were self-reported Han Chinese within three generations and they had no relationship to each other. Moreover, all participants were told the research purpose and procedures in detail and then signed the written informed consent.  

# 2.2. Clinical data collection  

We adopted a uni ﬁ ed questionnaire to record general demographic data, family history information and clinical history of stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and hyper lipid emi a. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured by using the calibrated mercury sph yg moma no meter. Two tubes of   $5~\mathrm{{ml}}$   blood samples were collected, with one tube adding heparin and the other without anticoagulant. Fasting venous blood were taken from the participants' elbow on the next morning. The non-anti coagulated blood was used to the determination of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low density lipoprotein cho lester in (LDL-C). The HITACHI 7600 automatic biochemical analyzer was carried out in accordance with the standard test procedure.  

# 2.3. Genomic DNA and genotyping  

Peripheral blood samples were stored at  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$   and genomic DNA was extracted within seven days using the TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) based on standard procedure provided by manufacturer. Then, the extracted DNA was separated into three tubes and stored at    $-80^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for later use. For rs2107595, primers were designed by Sequenom Assay Designer 3.1 software (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA), and primer sequences were shown in  Table 1 . Genotyping of HDAC9  gene polymorphism rs2107595 was conducted in the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform. The complete experiment was carried out in strict accordance with standard procedures, and some experiment processes including primer design, synthesis and genotype detection were mostly done by Bomiao Biological Co., Ltd., Beijing, China. Additionally,  $5\%$   DNA samples were randomly chosen for repeated experiment using blinding method, and the concordance rate of test results was   $100\%$  .  

# 2.4. Statistical analysis  

The SPSS 16.0 for windows software was used for comparing the general demographic data such as gender, age between the case group

and controls. The comparison between groups of categorical data was performed using the Chi-square test. Quantitative data was compared by independent samples  t  test. Genetic association between genotypes and risk of IS was evaluated by PLINK program ( http://pngu.mgh. harvard.edu/\~purcell/plink/ ). Chi-square goodness of  ﬁ t test was used to analyze whether the genotype frequency distribution of the control subjects was in Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium. The association analysis of the polymorphism with IS was estimated by using unconditional logistic regression analysis to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\%$  con ﬁ dence intervals   $(95\%\,\mathsf{C I})$  , and the ORs was still adjusted by sex and age. Association analysis of single polymorphism loci was evaluated by the following genetic models: additive model   $(\mathsf{A}_{1}\mathsf{A}_{1}\,/\,\mathsf{A}_{1}\mathsf{A}_{2}\,/\,\mathsf{A}_{2}\mathsf{A}_{2})$  , dominant model   $(\mathsf{A}_{1}\mathsf{A}_{1}\;+\;\mathsf{A}_{1}\mathsf{A}_{2}\;/\;\mathsf{A}_{2}\mathsf{A}_{2})$  , recessive model   $\left(\mathsf{A}_{1}\mathsf{A}_{1}\ \right)$   $\mathsf{A}_{1}\mathsf{A}_{2}+\mathsf{A}_{2}\mathsf{A}_{2})$  ) and allelic model   $\left(\mathsf{A}_{1}\,/\,\mathsf{A}_{2}\right)$  ,  $\mathsf{A}_{1}$   was minor allele and  $\mathsf{A}_{2}$  was major allele. Linear regression analysis was used to compute the association between the polymorphism and IS-related quantitative trait. Power analysis was performed by using Quanto software ( http:// hydra.usc.edu/gxe ). Parameters of the SNP rs2107595 were set up as follows: allele frequency was 0.340, the odds ratio was 1.3, sample size was 816, additive model was selected and the prevalence of stroke was 0.019. All statistical tests were two-sided and  $p$  -values  $<0.05$   was de ﬁ ned as statistical signi ﬁ cance.  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. Clinical characteristics of the subjects  

The statistical power of rs2107595 was   $95.04\%$  . In this case-control study, a total of 816 cases and 816 controls were included. Of the 816 patients, 465 were males   $(57.00\%)$   and 351 were females   $(43.00\%)$  , with the average age of   $65.97\pm10.50$   years. In control group, there were 433 males   $(53.10\%)$   and 383 females   $(46.90\%)$  , with   $65.26~\pm$  10.87 years of mean age. The distribution differences of sex, age, TC and TG level between case and control groups had no statistical signi ﬁ - cance (all  $p>0.05$  ). However, there were signi ﬁ cant differences between the two groups in SBP, DBP, HDL-C and LDL-C level (all    $p\!<\!0.05$  ).  

# 3.2. Association between HDAC9 polymorphism rs2107595 and IS risk  

As shown in  Table 2 , the genotype distribution in controls of rs2107595 polymorphism was in Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium  $(p>0.050)$  . No signi ﬁ cant differences were found between the  HDAC9 gene polymorphism rs2107595 and the hereditary susceptibility of IS in additive, dominant, recessive and allelic models (all  $p>0.050)$  ) ( Table 3 ). By gender strati ﬁ cation analysis, there were still no statistical signi ﬁ cances in the association of rs2107595 variant with IS risk whether adjust for sex and age or not (all  $p\!>\!0.050$  ) ( Table 4 ).  

3.3. Association between HDAC9 genetic variant rs2107595 and IS-related quantitative traits  

The results of IS-related quantitative traits in the sex-strati ﬁ ed analysis showed a signi ﬁ cant association of rs2107595 polymorphism with serum TC and TG level of IS patients ( Tables 5, 6 ). In males, the SNP rs2107595 was signi ﬁ cantly associated with serum TG level in additive model (  $p=0.004$  ,  $p_{a d j}=0.008j$  ) and dominant model   $'p=0.002$  ,  $p_{a d j}=0.003.$  . But the rs2107595 polymorphism showed no statistical signi ﬁ cance in SBP, DBP level and serum TC, HDL, LDL level among male IS population, with or without adjustment for age (all    $p>0.050$  ;  $p_{a d j}>0.050_{j}^{\circ}$  be associated with the serum TC level in additive model   $\dot{\mathbf{\mathit{p}}}=\mathbf{0}.038$  ;  $p_{a d j}\,=\,0.045.$  ) and dominant model   $~p\,=\,0.032$  ;    $p_{a d j}\,=\,0.037j$  ). Meanwhile, the rs2107595 variant also associated with serum LDL level in additive model (  $\textstyle p\,=\,0.049.$  ), but there was no signi ﬁ cant difference when further correcting for age   $(p_{a d j}\!>\!0.05)$  . Also, no statistical signi ﬁ cance was found between rs2107595 polymorphism and SBP, DBP level and serum TG, HDL level in female IS individuals (all  $p>0.050$  ;  $p_{a d j}>0.050_{.}$  ).  

# 4. Discussion  

To the best of our knowledge, the current study was the  ﬁ rst attempt to investigate the association between the GWAS supported polymorphism rs2107595 in  HDAC9  gene and the susceptibility of IS in a Chinese population. The results of this case-control study indicated that SNP rs2107595 may be not associated with IS, but with the SBP and serum TC, TG level in IS patients in southern Chinese Han population. Moreover, it's worth mentioning that the statistical power of rs2107595 reached   $95.04\%$  .  

A collaborative meta-analysis of IS GWAS (METASTROKE) in 12,389 IS patients and 62,004 controls ( Traylor et al., 2012 ) have reported that SNP rs2107595 in  HDAC9  gene as susceptibility loci that is strongly associated with stroke in the European populations. In a recent GWAS upon evaluating shared genetic variation of IS and coronary artery disease ( Dichgans et al., 2014 ), the association of the  HDAC9  genetic variant rs2107595 with stroke had also reached the genome-wide signi ﬁ cance in Caucasians. However, we failed to replicate the signi ﬁ cant association between SNP rs2107595 and the susceptibility to IS in our studied Chinese Han population. The possible cause of the inconsistent result is that rs2107595 polymorphism may have genetic heterogeneity to IS risk among different ethnic populations. According to the HapMap database, the minor allelic frequency (MAF) of rs2107595 is 0.311 in Chinese Han population in Beijing (HCB), of which the MAF is 0.200 in the northern and western European population (CEU). Therefore, a differential allele frequency of the SNP rs2107595 might have a disproportionate level of in ﬂ uence on stroke risk in the Chinese and European populations. Besides, our study sample size is smaller than the two GWAS, which cannot be entirely ruled out the possibility that the statistical power is not enough to reveal signi ﬁ cant association.

Evaluating the associations of SNP rs2107595 with IS-related quantitative traits including blood pressure and cholesterol level in the sexstrati ﬁ ed analysis, we found signi ﬁ cant associations of rs2107595 polymorphism with serum TC, TG level in IS patients. The polymorphism rs2107595 was located in the  $3^{\prime}$   region of  HDAC9  gene, which is involved in de acetyl ation of histones ( Haberland et al., 2009 ) and is expressed in multiple cell types, including endo the li al cells, smooth muscle cells and T lymphocytes ( Okamoto et al., 2006; Haberland et al., 2009; Kaluza et al., 2013 ).  HDAC9  encodes histone de acetyl as e 9 which was reported of acting as an endogenous negative regulator in adipogenic differentiation ( Chatterjee et al., 2011 ). As is well-known, atherosclerosis is the underlying pathology of stroke. Recent studies have reported that  HDAC9  played an important role in the development of atherosclerosis.  Azghandi et al. (2015)  demonstrated that the variant rs2107595 increased HDAC9 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mono nuclear cells and the de ﬁ ciency of  HDAC9  attenuates at hero scl erosis in mice.  Chatterjee et al. (2014)  reported that  HDAC9  knockout mice might be not prone to adipose tissue dysfunction.  Markus et al. (2013) indicated that  HDAC9  expression was up regulated in human carotid at hero sclerotic plaques in cerebral and systemic arteries, of which the SNP rs2107595 was signi ﬁ cantly associated with carotid intima – media thickness and carotid plaque.  Cao et al. (2014)  showed that  HDAC9 could repress cholesterol ef ﬂ ux and generate alternatively activated macrophages in atherosclerosis development. At hero sclerotic lesions are  ﬁ rstly caused by the accumulation of lipoprotein s in the vascular intima, which contain phospholipids, proteins and lipids such as TC and TG ( Ra ﬁ eian-Kopaei et al., 2014 ). Thus, there is a close relation between  HDAC9  and atherosclerosis, but the speci ﬁ c mechanisms related to blood lipid factors are still unknown. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to further explore the relationship between the  HDAC9  variant rs2107595 and IS-related risk factors.  

Several limitations should be pointed out in this study. Firstly, our samples of the present case-control study were mainly based on inpatients in a hospital, thereby possibly generating an inevitable selection bias. So, further research with more representative samples, including multi-center subjects and population-based subjects, is needed to better determine the association of the SNP rs2107595 with IS. Secondly, this study was only achieved in individuals of Chinese Han descent. Since there might exist ethnic heterogeneity, the genetic association results should be treated with cautious when the study extrapolated to other population. Thirdly, only one SNP on  HDAC9  gene was investigated in the relationship between rs2107595 and stroke, which can not represent all the genetic variants of  HDAC9  gene. Moreover,  Han et al. (2013)  have found that the SNP rs2389995 and rs2240419 on  HDAC9 were signi ﬁ cantly associated with stroke in the Chinese population. Hence, it is necessary that further studies focus on the issue whether rs2107595 can in ﬂ uence the occurrence of stroke by combined effects of the two SNPs in the Chinese population.  

In summary, our case-control study failed to replicated the GWASidenti ﬁ ed association of  HDAC9  variant rs2107595 with IS in this southern Chinese Han population. However, signi ﬁ cant  ﬁ ndings showed that rs2107595 polymorphism was associated with serum TC, TG level of IS patients. Additional research with multi-center subjects is warranted in different ethnicities to further con ﬁ rm the genetic association between rs2107595 and IS.
