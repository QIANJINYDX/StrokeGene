F5  (rs6025),  F2  (rs1799963),  FGG  (rs2066865) and  F11 (rs2036914) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for incident VTE according to individual SNPs and categories of risk alleles (5-SNP score; 0 – 1, 2, 3 – 4 and  $\geq5$  ) in participants with and without ischemic stroke.  Results: There were 192 patients with incident stroke, of whom 43 developed VTE during a median of 15.2 years of followup. The risk alleles of individual SNPs augmented the elevated VTE risk brought about by ischemic stroke. In stroke patients, a one-category increase in the genetic risk score was associated with a   $50\%$   higher relative risk of overall VTE (HR 1.5,   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.3 – 1.8) and an   $80\%$   higher relative risk of provoked VTE (HR 1.8,  $95\%$   CI 1.5 – 2.1). Stroke patients with  $\geq5$   risk alleles had a 12-fold (HR 11.7,  $95\%$   CI 4.1 – 33.3) higher relative risk of VTE than stroke-free participants with 0 – 1 risk alleles.  Conclusions:  Pro thr ombo tic genotypes increased the risk of VTE in stroke patients, and the risk increased with an increasing number of risk alleles.

# Introduction  

Recent studies have shown that patients with arterial cardiovascular disease (i.e. myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke) have an increased risk of subsequent venous thr ombo embolism (VTE) [1,2]. In patients with ischemic stroke, the incidence of VTE, particularly deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is high [3]. Even though clinically overt pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs in only   $1\%$   of stroke patients during the ﬁrst 14 days after an acute stroke [4,5], PE may account for up to   $25–50\%$   of deaths after acute stroke [5,6]. Recently, we reported a transient ly 20-fold increased risk of VTE within the ﬁrst month after ischemic stroke in a population-based cohort study [7].  

Simulation studies have shown that genetic proﬁling may be useful for discriminating between persons with high and low risk of disease [8,9]. To identify individuals with a high risk of a ﬁrst VTE, de Haan  et al.  created a genetic score based on 31 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported to be associated with VTE [10]. SNPs with the highest odds ratios of VTE were added one by one to construct a genetic risk score by use of the most parsimonious model with fewer SNPs. This resulted in a score of ﬁve SNPs: rs8176719 (non-O blood type) in  ABO , rs6025 (factor V Leiden [FVL]) in    $F5$  , rs1799963 (pro thro mb in G20210A) in    $F2$  , rs2066865 in the ﬁbrinogen gamma gene ( FGG ), and rs2036914 in  F11 . The genetic risk score based on these ﬁve SNPs performed similarly to the score of all 31 SNPs [10].  

Ischemic stroke is a heterogeneous multi causal disorder, and epidemiological data have provided substantial evidence for a genetic component of the disease [11,12]. Hyper coa gul ability has a more pronounced effect on the risk of ischemic stroke than the risk of myocardial infarction [13]. The genes in the 5-SNP score are associated not only with an increased risk of VTE but also with stroke. In a large meta-analysis, FVL and pro thro mb in G20210A were found to be associated with   $33\%$   and  $44\%$   increased risks of stroke, respectively [14]. In the large genome-wide association study METASTROKE,  ABO  was found to be associated with ischemic stroke [15]. This is consistent with previous ﬁndings showing that non-O blood type was associated with an   $83\%$   increased risk of stroke [16]. An association between    $F I I$   variation and overall ischemic stroke was reported in individuals aged    $<70$   years [17]. Increased levels of plasma ﬁbrinogen were associated with an increased risk of stroke [18], but variants in  FGG  were not related to a higher risk of stroke [19].  

Even though ischemic stroke increases VTE risk, and pro thr ombo tic genotypes are associated with both stroke and VTE, the joint effect of pro thr ombo tic genotypes and stroke on VTE risk has not been explored. Ident i cation of genetic risk factors that particularly increase VTE risk in stroke patients may guide decisions on thr ombo prop hylaxis in stroke patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of pro thr ombo tic genotypes on VTE risk in study participants with and without ischemic stroke in a population-based case – cohort study.  

# Methods  

# Study population  

The Tromsø Study is a single-center, prospective, population-based study, with repeated health surveys of the inhabitants of Tromsø, Norway. Study participants  $(n=30\ 371)$  ) were recruited from the fourth, ﬁfth and sixth surveys of the Tromsø Study, conducted in 1994 – 1995, 2001 – 2002, and 2007 – 2008, respectively. The overall attendance rates were high, with   $77\%$   in the fourth survey,   $79\%$   in the ﬁfth survey, and   $66\%$   in the sixth survey. A detailed description of the Tromsø Study has been published elsewhere [20]. The Tromsø Study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Northern Norway, and all participants provided informed written consent to participate.  

All subjects (  $(n=30\ 371$  ) were followed from the date of inclusion until a veriﬁed incident VTE event, migration, death, or end of follow-up (31 December 2012). Incident VTE events were identiﬁed by searching the hospital discharge diagnosis registry, the radiological procedure registry and the autopsy registry at the University Hospital of North Norway, and adjudicated by an endpoint committee, as previously described by Brækkan et al.  [21]. A VTE event was classiﬁed as either a DVT or a PE. When these events occurred concurrently, the event was classiﬁed as a PE. VTE events were further classiﬁed as provoked or unprovoked according to the presence of provoking risk factors at the time of diagnosis [21]. Major surgery or trauma within 8 weeks prior to the event, active cancer at the time of diagnosis, marked immobilization (i.e. bedrest for  $>3$   days, conﬁnement to a wheelchair, or long-distance travel for    $>4\textrm{h}$   within the last 14 days prior to the event) or other potential provoking factors spec i call y described by a physician in the medical record (e.g. intra vascular catheter) were considered to be provoking factors. Ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or other acute medical conditions were not included in the deﬁnition of provoked VTE.  

A total of 737 individuals without a previous VTE experienced a VTE during follow-up. Of these, 45 did not have blood samples available or of sufﬁcient quality for DNA analysis. Thus, the remaining 692 subjects were included as cases in our study. A subcohort   $(n=2016)$  was created by randomly sampling participants from the three surveys weighted for the age of the cases in 5-year age groups. Because of the case – cohort design, 71 of the cases were sampled and included in the subcohort. Study participants with a history of ischemic stroke   $(n=44)$  ) or with missing values for at least one of the risk allele variants   $(n=183)$  ) were excluded. Thus, our ﬁnal case cohort included 2481 participants, consisting of 664 VTE cases and 1817 subcohort members (Fig. 1).  

Baseline measurements  

Information on the study participants at study entry was collected by the use of physical examinations, blood samples, and self-administered questionnaires at each survey. Blood samples were collected from an ante cubit al vein, and analyzed at the Department of Clinical Chemistry at

the University Hospital of North Norway. DNA was isolated from whole blood and stored at    $-\ 70\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   at the national CONOR biobank, located at the HUNT Biobank in Levanger, Norway.  

Body weight and height were measured in study participants wearing light clothing and no shoes. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared   $(\mathrm{kg}\;\mathrm{m}^{-2})$  ). Information regarding a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke) prior to inclusion in the cohort, diabetes mellitus, smoking status (yes/no), physical activity and level of education was obtained by the use of self-reported questionnaires. The baseline variables have been described in detail elsewhere [20].  

# Genetic risk factors of VTE  

We genotyped the following SNPs: rs8176719 (non-O blood type) in  ABO , rs6025 (FVL) in    $F5$  , rs1799963 (pro thro mb in G20210A) in    $F2$   and rs2036914 in  F11  with the Sequenom platform, and rs2066865 in  $F G G$   with the TaqMan platform, as previously described [22]. For Sequenom, which uses single-base extension followed by mass spectrometry to measure the molecular mass of the extended primers, samples were genotyped with the Sequenom iPlex Gold Assay according to the recommended protocol, with an initial input of   $10{-}20~\mathrm{ng}$   of DNA, and were analyzed with MassARRAY Analyzer 4. Only genotypes with a high quality score of ‘A. Conservative’ or ‘B. Moderate’ were used. When multiple attempts were made to genotype an individual, one of the highest-quality genotypes across all attempts was chosen for each SNP. For TaqMan, an initial input of  $100~\mathrm{ng}$   of DNA was used. Samples were genotyped with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the recommended protocol, and processed with  SDS  2.4 (Thermo Fisher, Foster City, CA, USA). Genotypes passing a quality value threshold of 95 were used.  

Participants were considered to be carriers of the prothrombotic risk gene when one or two risk alleles were present. We did not differentiate between heterozygotes and homozygotes, because there were few homozygous study participants. The only genetic variant with a minor allele associated with reduced VTE risk was rs2036914 in F11 , and, in this case, we considered the common allele as the risk allele. The 5-SNP score conceived by de Haan et al.  was created by summarizing the number of risk alleles from the ﬁve sequenced SNPs [10].  

# Assessment of ischemic stroke  

Ischemic stroke during follow-up was deﬁned according to the World Health Organization deﬁnition when computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging or autopsy had ruled out brain hemorrhage [23]. An endpoint committee performed validation of in-hospital and out-of-hospital ischemic stroke events based on data from hospital and out-of-hospital journals, autopsy records, and death cert i cates, as previously described [7].  

# Statistical methods  

Statistical analyses were performed with  STATA  version 15.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with   $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for incident VTE according to the individual SNPs or categories of risk alleles (the 5-SNP score categories, i.e. 0 – 1, 2, 3 – 4 and  $\geq5$   risk alleles) in study participants with and without ischemic stroke. We used the non-weighted version of the 5-SNP risk score conceived by de Haan  et al.  [10], as we did not assign weight to the risk alleles according to their risk estimates for VTE. The joint risk conferred by ischemic stroke and the individual SNP was calculated with participants without stroke and with no risk allele as the reference category. When the 5-SNP score was assessed instead of the individual SNPs, participants without stroke and with 0 – 1 risk alleles were used as the reference category. Age was used as the time scale in the Cox model, with the age of the participants at study enrollment deﬁned as entry time, and the age at the time of the VTE event or censoring event (i.e. death, migration, or the date of study end) deﬁned as exit time. Ischemic stroke was included as a time-dependent covariate in the Cox model. Thus, participants who developed stroke during follow-up contributed person-years in both the unexposed group and the exposed group. All analyses were adjusted for age (as time scale) and sex. Because of the size of the subcohort, we did not make adjustments to the partial likelihood in the Cox

regression analyses [24]. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the anatomical localization of the thrombotic event (DVT and PE), and the presence of provoking risk factors at the time of diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of VTE after stroke according to the number of risk alleles in the 5-SNP score was displayed in a Kaplan-Meier failure plot based on the total person-time at risk among ischemic stroke patients in the full cohort. The proportional hazards assumption was tested by the use of Schoenfeld residuals and was found not to be violated.  

To investigate whether the effect of ischemic stroke on the risk of VTE differed across strata of pro thr ombo tic risk alleles, the presence of a biological interaction between these two exposures was assessed by calculating the relative excess risk attributable to interaction (RERI), the proportion attributable to interaction (AP), and the synergy index. These three measures of interaction with their corresponding   $95\%$   CIs were calculated according to Andersson  et al.  [25], with an excel sheet (epinet.se/res/ xls/epi net calculation.xls). Brieﬂy, the RERI can be interpreted as part of the total effect that is attributable to interaction, and the AP as the proportion of the combined effect that is attributable to interaction [26]. A RERI of  $>0$  , an AP of  $>0$   and a synergy index of  $>1.0$  suggest positive interaction or more than additivity, i.e. that the effect of the joint exposure to two risk factors is greater than the sum of the separate effects [25,26].  

# Results  

In our cohort, 192 participants had incident ischemic stroke during a median of 15.2 years of follow-up. The baseline characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1. The mean age was higher in stroke patients than in those without stroke: 67 years versus 57 years, respectively. The proportion of study participants with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus was higher among stroke patients, whereas mean BMI and the proportion of males and current smokers were similar in both groups. The prevalence of risk alleles for each of the SNPs studied was similar in the two groups (Table 1). In the 5-SNP score, the distribution of individuals across number of risk alleles was almost the same for participants with and without ischemic stroke (Fig. 2).

In total, 43 of the 664 VTE events in our study occurred in patients with ischemic stroke. The characteristics of the VTE events in participants with and without stroke are shown in Table 2. The distribution of DVT and PE   $(57\%$  versus   $43\%$  , and   $54\%$   versus   $47\%$   in patients with and without stroke, respectively) was essentially similar in both groups. The proportion of provoked VTE events was higher in patients with ischemic stroke   $(77\%)$   than in those without stroke   $(49\%)$  . Moreover, the proportion of patients immobilized before the VTE was substantially higher among those with stroke   $63\%$   versus   $18\%$  ). Ischemic stroke was associated with an age-adjusted and sex-adjusted overall two-fold (HR 2.0,   $95\%$   CI 1.5 – 2.8) higher relative risk of VTE, two-fold (HR 2.0,  $95\%$   CI 1.3 – 3.1) higher relative risk of DVT and two-fold (HR 2.0,   $95\%$   CI 1.3 – 3.2) higher relative risk of PE than in study participants without stroke.  

The risk estimates of VTE according to the individual SNPs in study participants with and without ischemic stroke are shown in Table 3. In the absence of ischemic stroke, non-O blood type (rs8176719), FVL (rs6025) and pro thro mb in G20210A (rs1799963) all increased the relative risk of VTE, whereas no effect on VTE risk was observed for the SNPs in  FGG  (rs2066865) and  F11 (rs2036914). For all of the individual SNPs, the combinations of ischemic stroke and  $\geq1$   risk alleles were associated with an increased relative risk of VTE. The highest relative risk of VTE was conferred by joint exposure to ischemic stroke and FVL (HR 4.8,   $95\%$   CI 2.4 – 9.6) and pro thro mb in G20210A (HR 9.6,   $95\%$   CI 1.3 – 68.6). As shown in Table 4, measures quantifying interaction on an additive scale (i.e. RERI, AP, and synergy index)

suggested a positive interaction between ischemic stroke and each of the pro thr ombo tic SNPs, with the exception of the non-O blood type.  

When the 5-SNP score was used (Table 3), the relative risk of VTE increased gradually across categories of number of risk alleles (0 – 1, 2, 3 – 4 and  $\geq5$   risk alleles) in both study participants with and without stroke as

compared with participants without stroke and 0 – 1 risk alleles. It is of note that the dose – response relationship was even more pronounced in stroke patients. When the score was analyzed as an ordinal variable, the relative risk of VTE increased by   $20\%$   (HR 1.2,  $95\%$   CI 1.1 – 1.3) per increase of genetic risk category in study participants without stroke, and by   $50\%$   (HR 1.5,   $95\%$   CI 1.3 – 1.8) among those with stroke. We found a synergistic effect between number of risk alleles and ischemic stroke on the relative risk of VTE. Patients with ischemic stroke and  $\geq5$  risk alleles had a 12-fold (HR 11.7,  $95\%$  CI 4.1 – 33.3) higher relative risk of VTE than study participants without stroke and 0 – 1 risk alleles. This was higher than expected on the basis of the individual effects of ischemic stroke and  $\geq5$   risk alleles. Indeed, all measures of interaction described in Table 4 suggested a positive interaction between the two exposures. For instance, the AP revealed that   $80\%$   of the total VTE events in participants with stroke and  $\geq5$   risk alleles were attributable to the interaction between the two exposures. In subgroup analyses, having both stroke and

  $\geq5$   risk alleles resulted in HRs of 13.3 (  $95\%$   CI 3.0 –

 58.0) for DVT and 10.0  $(95\%\mathrm{~CI~}2.3–44.1)$  ) for PE

 (Table S1). As in the overall analysis, measures of interaction suggested a positive interaction between stroke and  $\geq5$   risk alleles regarding the risk of either DVT or PE (Table S2).  

The risk estimates of provoked and unprovoked VTE according to the individual SNPs in participants with and without stroke are shown in Table S3. For non-O blood type, FVL, and the SNPs in    $F G G$   and    $F I I$  , risk estimates for provoked events were higher than those for unprovoked events in study participants jointly exposed to stroke and  $\geq1$   risk alleles. In patients with stroke, the risk estimates for VTE across categories of risk alleles in the 5-SNP score were higher for provoked than for unprovoked events (Table 5). The relative risk of provoked events increased by   $80\%$   per increase of risk category (HR 1.8,   $95\%$   CI 1.5 – 2.1), whereas no association was observed for unprovoked events (HR 1.1,  $95\%$   CI 0.8 – 2.1). Participants jointly exposed to  $\geq5$   risk alleles and stroke had a 23-fold (HR 23.0,   $95\%$   CI 7.8 – 68.2) higher relative risk of provoked VTE than study

participants without stroke and 0 – 1 risk alleles. In participants without stroke, the risk estimates for unprovoked VTE were higher than those for provoked VTE in all risk categories (Table 5).  

The 5-year cumulative incidence of VTE after stroke according to the total number of risk alleles in the 5-SNP score is shown in Fig. 3. There was a notable increase in the cumulative incidence of VTE during the initial 6 months after ischemic stroke, with a substantially steeper slope in the incidence curve for individuals in the high-risk category of the genetic score than for individuals with fewer risk alleles (Fig. 3).  

# Discussion  

In the present case – cohort study with participants recruited from the general population, we found a

synergistic effect of ischemic stroke and pro thr ombo tic genotypes on the risk of VTE. The combined exposure to ischemic stroke and each of the individual SNPs (i.e. FVL, pro thro mb in G20210A, or variations in  FGG  or F11 ) resulted in an effect on VTE risk that exceeded the sum of the separate effects. When the 5-SNP risk score [10] was applied, the number of pro thr ombo tic risk alleles showed a dose – response relationship with VTE risk, both in participants with stroke and in those without stroke. The dose – response relationship was particularly pronounced in stroke patients, and the relative risks of overall VTE and provoked VTE increased, on average, by  $50\%$   and   $80\%$  , respectively, per category increase in the genetic score. Furthermore, the combination of ischemic stroke and the high-risk category of the genetic score (i.e.  $\geq5$   risk alleles) yielded an effect on VTE risk that was greater than the sum of the separate effects. It is of note that  $>80\%$   of the VTE events occurring among study participants jointly exposed to ischemic stroke and the high-risk category of the genetic score appeared to be attributable to the interaction between the two risk factors. As the point estimates for provoked VTE events were higher than those for unprovoked events, our ﬁndings suggest that the increased risk of VTE in stroke patients was mainly driven by a combination of strokerelated provoking factors and genetic risk factors.  

Recently, we reported that patients with ischemic stroke have a transient ly increased risk of VTE [7], which is consistent with previous registry-based population studies investigating the temporal relationship between ischemic stroke and VTE [1,27]. This transient nature of VTE risk after stroke underscores the role of stroke-related factors as the main contributors to the development of thrombotic events. Indeed, measures of stroke severity have been shown to be strongly associated with the risk of subsequent VTE [28]. Accordingly, our risk estimates were higher for provoked than for unprovoked VTE events in study participants jointly exposed to stroke and pro thr ombo tic risk genes. Even though these ﬁndings should be interpreted with caution, given the low number of unprovoked VTE events among stroke patients, they were consistent across the pro thr ombo tic risk genes studied. It is likely that complications after acute stroke, such as prolonged immobilization, leg paralysis, and secondary infections, which are all established risk factors for VTE [29 – 32], may contribute to VTE risk. Previous studies have shown that individuals undergoing prolonged immobilization [33,34] or with upper respiratory tract infections [35], who are also carriers of pro thr ombo tic risk genes, have an increased VTE risk that exceeds the sum of the separate effects of the risk factors. However, to the best of our knowledge, no other study has explored the joint effect of ischemic stroke and pro thr ombo tic risk genes on VTE risk.  

Our ﬁndings of an increased VTE risk after stroke in individuals with pro thr ombo tic genotypes appear to be consistent with the thrombosis potential model. In this model, the thrombosis potential reﬂects the VTE risk that is present during an individual’s life, and each risk factor contributes to increase the thrombosis potential [36]. When sufﬁcient risk factors have been accumulated, the thrombosis potential exceeds the ‘thrombosis threshold’ and a thrombotic event occurs [36]. Stroke is a strong risk factor for VTE [7]. However, when the 5-SNP score was applied, the VTE risk in stroke patients with one risk allele or no risk alleles was not increased as compared with participants without stroke. Our ﬁndings imply that the combination of stroke-related risk factors and prothrombotic risk genes is needed to suf cie ntl y increase the thrombosis potential, leading to an incident VTE event. The aggregation of these risk factors may explain why, in individuals with several risk alleles, the VTE events occurred mainly in the initial months after ischemic stroke. Moreover, the addition of risk alleles resulted in a dose-dependent increase in VTE risk. Stroke patients with  $\geq5$   risk alleles had almost 12-fold higher VTE risk than participants without stroke and  $\leq1$   risk alleles. All measures of interaction (i.e. RERI, AP, and synergy index) between risk alleles and ischemic stroke relative to VTE risk pointed towards a substantial synergistic effect. When these ﬁndings were analyzed in light of the thrombosis potential model, our results suggested that ischemic stroke and the high-risk category of the 5-SNP score yielded a higher thrombosis potential together than separately [36].  

Even though our results regarding the interaction between stroke and pro thr ombo tic genotypes do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the underlying mechanisms, as interaction is deﬁned in numerical terms [36], one may still speculate on the path o physiology behind these ﬁndings. A potential mechanism includes an association between pro thr ombo tic genotypes and severity of stroke. If the pro thr ombo tic genotypes are somehow related to severity of stroke, this may lead to more pronounced or prolonged immobilization after acute stroke. However, whether the pro thr ombo tic genotypes assessed in this study inﬂuence the severity or outcome of ischemic stroke is as yet unclear, as studies on this topic are scarce, and have often been limited by small sample sizes [17]. The VTE risk in stroke patients could be further ampliﬁed by the hyper coa gul able state associated with the pro thr ombo tic genotypes, either through resistance to activated protein C because of FVL [37,38], increased levels of pro thro mb in or FXI in the presence of pro thro mb in G20210A or F11 variation, respectively [39,40], or changes in the levels of ﬁbrinogen $\cdot\gamma^{\prime}$  , a product of alternative splicing of  FGG  that is inversely related to thrombotic risk [41]. As hyper coa gul ability seems to play a more pronounced role in the risk of ischemic stroke than in the risk of myocardial infarction, particularly among those aged    $<50$   years [13], the observed interaction between ischemic stroke and pro thr ombo tic geno- types in relation to VTE risk could have been especially relevant in young individuals. However, because of limited statistical power, we did not perform such subgroup analysis. It is important to note that the present study was not designed to investigate the aforementioned proposed mechanisms. Nevertheless, our results may form the basis for further studies to conﬁrm the interaction and to investigate the underlying mechanism(s).  

International guidelines for VTE prevention after stroke suggest prophylactic-dose heparin (un fraction a ted or low molecular weight heparin) or intermittent pneumatic compression devices over no prophylaxis in patients with acute ischemic stroke and restricted mobility [42]. Prophylaxis should be initiated as early as possible and should be continued throughout the hospital stay or until the patient regains mobility. However, the guidelines are mainly based on one randomized study (the Clots in Legs or Stockings after Stroke [CLOTS] study), in which no information was provided regarding the prevalence of pro thr ombo tic risk genes in the study population [43]. Despite the recommendation of anticoagulant use during the hospitalization, the high incidence of VTE observed after stroke indicates that VTE prophylaxis in stroke patients is inadequate. Indeed, data from clinical practice have shown that  $<50\%$   of ischemic stroke patients at risk of VTE receive any form of thromboprophylaxis [44,45]. This may be attributable to poor compliance following guidelines, or uncertainty regarding how to assess patients at increased risk of VTE. The Padua prediction score uses both ischemic stroke and known thrombophilic conditions to predict VTE in hospitalized patients [46]. However, the Padua score does not differentiate between number of risk alleles, and external validation of the prediction score showed limited performance for predicting VTE among hospitalized medical patients [47]. Our ﬁnding of an increased VTE risk after stroke with an increasing number of pro thr ombo tic risk alleles suggests that the number of pro thr ombo tic risk alleles could be considered in future investigations aimed at assessing thrombosis risk in patients with ischemic stroke. Identiﬁcation of patients in whom supra-additive effects on VTE risk are present because of the combination of stroke-related risk factors and pro thr ombo tic risk alleles would allow the implementation of more effective thr ombo prophylaxis, which may reduce the incidence of VTE after stroke. Therefore, new studies are warranted to explore to what extent the assessment of pro thr ombo tic genotypes in stroke patients would improve the risk strat i cation of VTE and aid clinical decisions regarding therapeutic interventions.  

Major strengths of our study include the prospective design with participants recruited from the general population, the large number of genotyped participants, the longterm follow-up, the wide age distribution, and the validated events of both ischemic stroke and VTE. The high participation rate in the Tromsø Study and the broad age range resulted in a cohort that is representative of the general population, and minimized selection bias in the subcohort. Some limitations merit attention. Even though our study was derived from a large cohort, the number of VTE events was low in some subgroups, particularly for the rare genetic variants, which resulted in limited statistical power. Our results regarding the measures that quantify interaction should therefore be interpreted with caution. Population stratiﬁcation can be a source of bias in association studies [48], but, given that most of our study participants (VTE cases and subcohort members) were Caucasians, population stratiﬁcation would be very unlikely in this study. Unfortunately, we did not have information on stroke severity or the number of patients with leg paralysis or prolonged immobilization.  

In conclusion, we found a synergistic effect of ischemic stroke and pro thr ombo tic genotypes on the risk of subsequent VTE. In stroke patients, an increasing number of risk alleles resulted in a dose-dependent increased risk of VTE, particularly of provoked VTE events. Our ﬁndings suggest that genetic risk factors play an important role in the development of VTE after stroke.
