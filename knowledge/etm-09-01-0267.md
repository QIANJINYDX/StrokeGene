Abstract.  The aim of the present study was to examine  clop i dog rel resistance (CR) in patients with ischemic cerebral  infarction and its potential association with a single nucleo­ tide polymorphism (SNP; rs1045642) in the  ABCB1  gene.  Patients with ischemic cerebral infarction received clop i dog rel   $(75~\mathrm{mg/day})$   for 7 days and were then subjected to a turbidi­ metric assay to determine platelet aggregation. Patients were  then divided into a CR group and a clop i dog rel-sensitive (CS)  group. Demographic and clinical data between the two groups  were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis  was performed to determine independent risk factors of CR.  PCR products were sequenced to assess  ABCB1  rs1045642  SNP genotype and allele frequencies in each group. In total,  303 patients were enrolled in the study; this included 51 CR  cases   $(16.83\%)$  ) and  $252\,\mathrm{CS}$   cases   $(83.17\%)$  . Several parameters,  including hypertension, diabetes, calcium channel blocker  (CCB),   $\upbeta$  ‑receptor blocking agent and proton pump inhibitor  use, and creatinine, fasting blood glucose, homo cyst eine (HCY),  high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs‑CRP) and triglyceride  levels were significantly higher in the CR group than in the  CS group. Diabetes, hs‑CRP-increased use of CCBs, and use  of  $\upbeta$  -blockers were found to be independent risk factors for  CR. However,  ABCB1  gene rs1045642 polymorphism was not  found to be an independent risk factor for CR. In conclusion,  CR in ischemic stroke patients is associated with several inde­ pendent risk factors, including diabetes, hs‑CRP‑increased  use of CCBs, and use of  $\upbeta$  -blockers. However,  ABCB1  gene  rs1045642 polymorphism has no correlation with CR.  

# Introduction  

Clop i dog rel is an anti-platelet agent used to prevent blood  clots. It selectively and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 class of  adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptors on platelets to prevent  aggregation. Although a number of studies have confirmed the  clinical efficacy of clop i dog rel as an anti-thrombotic agent, its  efficiency in preventing platelet aggregation is not uniform in  all patients. Between 4 and  $44\%$   of patients receiving this drug  display a poor response (1,2). The patients that fail to respond  are referred to as clop i dog rel resistant (3).  

While the exact reason for clop i dog rel resistance (CR) is not  clear (4), the response to the drug is influenced by genetics and  by clinical and path o physiological factors (5,6). Clop i dog rel is  a pro-drug. That is, before it can exert its anti‑platelet activity,  it must be metabolized by the liver into its active form; it is  only this active metabolite of clop i dog rel that is able to bind the  ADP receptors on platelets to prevent aggregation (7). Intestinal  epithelial cells expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) can influence  the absorption of clop i dog rel from the digestive tract into the  blood, thus affecting the efficacy of the drug (8,9). ABCB1 is  expressed in P-gp epithelial cells (10), and the distribution of  P-gp differs among individuals; this may explain the differen­ tial response of patients to clop i dog rel (10). Recent studies have  shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within  the  ABCB1  gene affect its degree of transcription and transla­ tion; subsequently, clop i dog rel response may also be affected.  Simon  et al  reported that the serum concentration of the active  metabolite of clop i dog rel is reduced in individuals with the  ABCB1  gene   $3435\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}$   SNP (7). Another study reported that  in patients treated with clop i dog rel,  ABCB1    $3435\mathrm{C}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{T}$   poly­ morphism, T allele carriers and major adverse cardiovascular  events (MACE) are all closely associated with risk (11). These  earlier studies focused on coronary heart disease patients,  whose disease pathogen es is differs from those with ischemic  stroke. Thus, in the present study, the risk factors of Chinese  patients with ischemic cerebral infarction were explored and  the correlation between  ABCB1  gene polymorphisms and  CR was examined. The data obtained may help to improve  individualized anti platelet treatment options for the ischemic  stroke population and reduce adverse side‑effects.  

# Materials and methods  

Subjects.  Patients with ischemic cerebral infarction who  were seen at Jingzhou Central Hospital of Tongji Medical  College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology  (Jinzhou, China) between June 2013 and December 2013  were enrolled in the present study if they met the following  inclusion criteria: i) older than 18 years; ii) present or past  diagnosis of ischemic stroke [according to the 2010 Chinese  Guidelines for the Management of Ischemic Stroke (12),  with clinical symptoms and computed tomography (CT) or  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) verification]; iii) Trial  of  $\mathrm{Org~}10172$   in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classifica­ tion (13) of large artery atherosclerosis or small arteries with  non-cardiac ischemic stroke. Patients who met the following  exclusion criteria were not enrolled: i) 10 days of treatment  with clop i dog rel, ti clop i dine, di pyr ida mole or other antiplatelet drugs, or treatment with other non-steroidal drugs;  ii)   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   of treatment with standard or low‑molecular‑weight  heparin; iii)  major surgery within the preceding week;  iv) occurrence of any bleeding disorders or a family history of  blood diseases; v) kidney or heart dysfunction or other serious  systemic diseases; vi) concurrent malignancy or ongoing antitumor therapy; vii) platelet count   ${<}150x10^{12}/1$   or  ${>}450x10^{12}/1$  ,  and hemoglobin  ${<\!8\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{l}}$  . The study and all procedures were  approved by the ethics committee of Tongji Medical College,  Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and all  patients enrolled in the provided signed informed consent.  

Information collection.  Information was obtained from all  patients on their general condition, medical history (hyper­ tension, diabetes or coronary heart disease), personal history  (smoking and drinking), laboratory tests, and use of concomi­ tant medications, namely calcium channel blockers (CCBs),  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,   $\upbeta$  -blockers,  lipid‑lowering drugs and proton pump inhibitors.  

Determination of platelet aggregation.  The turbid i metric  method using optical density (1ight transmission aggregation,  LTA) was performed to assess ADP   $(20\ \mu\mathrm{mol}/1)$  -induced  platelet aggregation. Prior to collection of the specimens, the  patients had received clop i dog rel   $(75~\mathrm{mg})$  ) daily for one week.  Blood (2ml) was extracted from the cubital vein of each patient  in the morning on an empty stomach; two tubes of blood were  filled and gently inverted to prevent clotting. Then, to prepare  platelet-rich plasma (PRP), the samples were first spun at   $700\mathrm{~x~g~}$   for   $10\ \mathrm{min}$  , and the sample quality, including severe  hemolysis and severe lipemia, was determined. The superna­ tant containing PRP was removed, placed in a separate tube,  and stored at room temperature until use. PRP was separated  from platelet-poor plasma (PPP) by cent ri fuga tion at  $^{2,200\;\mathrm{x}\;\mathrm{g}}$    for   $10~\mathrm{min}$  . For test sampling,   $300\;\mu\mathrm{l}$   of each sample (PRP  and PPP) was drawn, and platelet aggregation was deter­ mined using an SC-2000 platelet testing apparatus (Beijing  Saikexide Technology Development Co., Ltd., Beijing, China);  platelet aggregation was induced by treatment with ADP   $(20\;\mu\mathrm{mol}/1)$  ). A platelet aggregation rate  ${\geq}70\%$   was defined  as CR, and a platelet aggregation rate   ${<}70\%$   was defined as  clop i dog rel‑sensitive (CS). All experiments were performed  within  $3\mathrm{~h~}$  .  

Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping.  Genomic DNA  was isolated from   $1~\mathrm{ml}$   peripheral blood using a TIANamp  Blood DNA kit [DP318; Tiangen Technology (Beijing) Co.,  Ltd., Beijing, China]. Samples were stored at   $\mathrm{-}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until use.  Primers used for genotyping were as follows: (rs1045642-F:  5‑'GA AT G TTC AGT GG CT CCG A‑  $.3^{\prime}$   and rs1045642-R:  5'‑CT CCC AG GC TG TTT A TTT GA‑3'). PCR amplification  (BTC-1000; Bio Basic, Markham, Canada) was performed  as follows:  $50\;\mu1$   reaction volume containing template DNA   $1\;\mu\mathrm{l}$  , upstream and downstream primers   $1\;\mu\mathrm{l}$  , dNTP   $10~\mathrm{mM}$   $1\;\mu\mathrm{l}$  , Taq Buffer   $5\,\mu\mathrm{l}$  ,   $25~\mathrm{mM}$     $\mathrm{{MgCl}}_{2}$  ,   $5\;\mu\mathrm{l}$   Taq enzyme (5 U/  $\mu\mathrm{l}$  )  $0.5\,\mu\mathrm{l}$   and water   $35.5\,\mu\mathrm{l}$  . PCR cycling conditions consisted  of  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   de natura tion for  $3\;\mathrm{{min}}$  , 35 cycles of  $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   de natura tion  for 30 sec,   $56^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   annealing for 35 sec, and   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   extension for   $40\;\mathrm{sec}$  , and finally one cycle of  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   repair extension for 5 min.  PCR products were purified (SK1141 kit; Sangon Biotech,  Shanghai, China), measured using a 3730 DNA sequence  analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and  sequenced.  

Statistical analysis.  SPSS software package, version 17.0  (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to conduct the  statistical analysis. Quantitative data are presented as the  mean  $\pm$   standard deviation or median (quartiles). According to  the nature of the statistical data, classification was performed  by  $\chi^{2}$   test, corrected  $\chi^{2}$   test or Fisher's exact test. Normality and  homogeneity of variance were determined by t-test between  two independent samples; non-parametric Wilcoxon test was  used for this type of analysis.   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$   was considered to indi­ cate a statistically significant difference. Univariate analysis   $_{(\mathrm{P<}0.05)}$   and significant professional binary logistic regression  analysis were performed to assess independent risk factors.  

# Results  

CR and ischemic stroke risk factors, correlation of labora­ tory tests and concomitant medication.  A total of 303 cases  (93 females and 210 males) met all requirements and were  included in the study. Cases ranged in age from 29 to 82 years,  with a mean age of   $63.65{\scriptstyle\pm9.60}$   years. There were 51 cases   $(16.83\%)$   of CR, and 252 cases   $(83.17\%)$   were categorized into  the CS group.  

Univariate analysis demonstrated that several risk factors  associated with ischemic stroke, including hypertension and  diabetes, correlated with CR (Table I). Similarly, treatment with  CCBs,   $\upbeta$  ‑receptor blocking agents and proton pump inhibitors  was also associated with CR. Laboratory tests for creatinine   $(\mathrm{Cr})$  ,  fasting blood glucose (FBG), homo cyst eine (HCY), high‑sensi­ tivity C-reactive protein (hs‑CRP), and triglycerides also  confirmed that each of these factors positively correlated with  CR   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$  ; Table I). CR occurred in   $20\%$   of patients with  hypertension; by contrast, only   $7.69\%$   of individuals without  hypertension experienced resistance to the drug. CR was also  more common in diabetic patients   $(54.55\%)$   than in non-diabetic  patients   $(12.22\%)$  . It was also observed that CR was associated  with the administration of various agents, including CCBs   $(\chi^{2}{=}10.566,\mathrm{P}{<}0.01)$  ,  $\upbeta$  -blockers   $(\chi^{2}{=}14.052,\mathrm{P}{<}0.001)$   and proton  pump inhibitors (  $\chi2{=}12.767$  ,  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$  ) and with several labora­ tory tests, including measures of   $\mathrm{Cr}$   (  $Z{=}2.286$  ,   $\mathrm{{P}{<}0.05}$  ), FBG   $(Z{=}3.375$  ,  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.01$  ), HCY (  $Z{=}2.31$  ,  $\mathrm{{P}{<}0.05}$  ), hs‑CRP   $Z{=}6.582$  ,

Univariate analysis identified several statistically signifi­ cant independent variables, including hypertension, diabetes,  CCBs,   $\upbeta$  ‑receptor blocking agents, proton pump inhibitors,  Cr, FBG, HCY, hs‑CRP, and triglycerides which were associ­ ated with CR as dependent variables. Controlling for gender,  smoking and other factors, binary logistic regression analysis  identified several additional independent risk factors associ­ ated with CR, including CCBs,   $\upbeta$  -blockers, hs‑CRP and  diabetes (Table II).

Correlation among ischemic stroke, ABCB1 gene rs1045642  polymorphism and CR.  Polymorphisms of the  ABCB1  gene  (rs1045642) are shown in Table III. The two polymorphisms  were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Univariate  analysis revealed that there was a significant difference between  the CR and CS groups   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.006}$  ,   $\chi^{2}{=}10.383$  ). Moreover, there  were different associations between each of the genotypes and  response to clop i dog rel. For example, there was no significant  difference in the C, T allele frequency between the CR and CS  groups   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.223}$  ,  $\chi^{2}{=}1.488$  ). Controlling for gender, smoking,  and other factors, binary logistic regression analysis was  performed and it was found that none of the three genotypes  were independent risk factors for CR (  $\mathrm{P{=}0.0192}$  ,  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.070}$   and   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.118}$  ).  

# Discussion  

The majority of previous studies examining CR have focused  on individuals with cardiovascular disease. By contrast,  less is known about the response to clop i dog rel in patients  suffering from ischemic stroke. In the present study, a   $16.83\%$  incidence of CR was observed, which is consistent with the  rates published in the literature   $(4–44\%)$   (1,2). However, there  are differences between cardiovascular and cerebro vascular  conditions that is it necessary to address.  

The exact mechanisms responsible for CR are unknown.  However, several studies have shown that self-compliance,  inadequate dosing, absorption or metabolic dysfunction, drug  interactions, diabetes, vascular factors, and genetic factors  may all influence the response to the drug (14-17). Other  studies have shown a decreased response to clop i dog rel in  patients with elevated levels of glycated hemoglobin and  C-peptide (18,19). Diabetes has also been described as an  independent risk factor for CR (20). In the present study, it was  found that the long-term use of CCBs, hs‑CRP and  $\upbeta$  -blockers  is associated with CR. While the association between CCBs  and clop i dog rel has been previously reported (21), to the  best of our knowledge, this is the first time any correlations  between  $\upbeta$  -blockers, hs‑CRP and clop i dog rel response have  been described. These findings suggest that patients with these  factors should be given more attention, with regular testing for  platelet aggregation. It is important to identify patients with  CR, as they may benefit from additional anti-platelet drugs to  prevent recurrent stroke.  

Recent studies have focused on the identification of potential  correlations between CR and genetic polymorphisms (22,23).  Clop i dog rel is a pro-drug that must be metabolized to its active  form. Two genes important for drug metabolism are  ABCB1 and  CYP2C19 .  CYP2C19  has been previously linked to CR  (24,25). Associations between  ABCB1  and CR are not as well  established and studies have reported conflicting results. One  study found that patients with the  ABCB1  TT genotype at the  rs1045642 locus had a higher risk of recurrent ischemic events  following clop i dog rel treatment; those with the wild‑type  CC genotype did not experience this increased rate of recur­ rence (11). In contrast to these findings, another study reported  that individuals with the wild-type CC genotype had a higher  risk of recurrent ischemic events following clop i dog rel treat­ ment (26). Importantly, these earlier studies focused on coronary  heart disease patients and not on stroke sufferers. In the present  study, the potential correlation between  ABCB1  genotype and  ischemic stroke recurrence was examined in patients treated  with clop i dog rel. Notably, no significant correlation was identi­ fied among these variables. This could be due to confounding  factors. Additionally, a single polymorphic locus may not  be directly responsible for the effect; instead, an analysis of  multiple polymorphic loci may require consideration.  

In conclusion, the data presented in the present study  suggest that several patient characteristics should be consid­ ered prior to the administration of clop i dog rel. This would  help distinguish patients that are likely to respond to the drug  from those that would likely be resistant. While this study  is promising, it is partly limited by its small sample size. It  should be followed up by another multi-center clinical trial  with a greater number of patients in order to confirm and  verify these findings.
