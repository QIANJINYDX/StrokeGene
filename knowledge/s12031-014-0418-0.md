Abstract  Genetic variants of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) gene have been suggested to influence the PAI1 transcription activity and PAI-1 levels as well as might be involved in the path o physiology of stroke. The aims of this study are to investigate whether the polymorphisms at the PAI-1 gene are associated with the risk of stroke and to explore the combined effects of PAI-1 variants and combined oral contraceptive (COC) use for stroke risk. We conducted a nested case-control study using 453 first-ever female stroke cases and 919 age- and region-matched controls that were recruited from our prospective surveillance cohort. SNP rs1799889 was genotyped by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and SNPs rs7242 and rs2227631 were detected by the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. We identified that rs1799889 5G allele conferred a protective effect against ischemic stroke while 4G allele conferred an increased risk of ischemic stroke. But we failed to suggest associations of rs7242 and rs2227631. COC users had a 1.31-fold   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.31$  ,  $95~\%~\mathrm{CI}{=}1.01{-}1.71)$  ) increased risk of stroke compared with the non-users. Furthermore, COC users with rs1799889 4G5G/5G5G genotype had a decreased risk of ischemic stroke (  $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.53$  ,  $95\,\%\,\mathrm{CI}{=}0.34{-}0.83$  ). Moreover, haplotype G-5GT was associated with an increased risk of overall stroke (OR  $=\!1.28$  ,   $95~\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.01{-}1.62\$  . In contrast, haplotype A-4G-G and haplotype G-5G-T were slightly associated with the protection from ischemic stroke (  $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.61$  ,  $95\,\%\,\mathrm{CI}{=}0.46{-}0.82$  ;  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.61$  ,   $95\ \%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.44{-}0.85$  , respectively). The study assessed the associations of three PAI-1 SNPs and also suggested combined effects of these PAI-1 gene variants and COC use on stroke risk in the Han Chinese women.

# Introduction  

More than 50 years after the introduction of combined oral contraceptives (COC), it is now established that COC has become the most effective method of reversible contraception around the world (Huezo  1998 ). However, case-control and cohort studies have identified that COC use, even at a low dose, was associated with cardiovascular diseases, including venous thr ombo embolism (VTE), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (Dinger et al.  2010 ; Li et al.  2006 ; Zakharova et al. 2011 ). These days, stroke leads to a global health burden, and about 15 million people worldwide are suffering from stroke annually. In China, approximately 1.6 million die from stroke per year, which has become the leading cause of death (Liu et al.  2011 ). The past decades have witnessed an increased risk of stroke with the use of COC, which has been identified in a multitude of studies (Algra et al.  2012 ; Wang et al.  2012 ). The risk of hemorrhagic stroke was dramatically correlated with low-dose COC in Chinese population, and the risk is accelerated if combined with advancing age, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and drinking (Li et al.  2006 ).  

But the mechanism of stroke pathogen es is still remains elusive. In addition to the environmental factors, host genetic factors are considered to play a central role in determining the pathology of stroke development, progression, or regression. The vast majority of these studies have focused on the role of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene. Human PAI-1, a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily, is synthesized by a number of tissues and cells, such as macrophages, endothelium, human endometrium, and adipose tissue (Dellas and Loskutoff  2005 ; Morange et al.  1999 ; Casslén et al.  1992 ). As the main inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activators, PAI-1 not only decreases fi bri no lysis but also contributes to regulate cellular signal transduction. Elevated plasma levels of PAI-1 could impair fi bri no lysis and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Mounting evidence have confirmed that high levels of PAI-1 was significantly associated with stroke risk (Catto et al.  1997 ; Johansson et al.  2000 ).  

Several lines of evidence pointed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PAI-1 gene could influence the PAI-1 transcription activity and PAI-1 levels of human plasma and suggested that genetic variants of the PAI-1 gene might be involved in the path o physiology of stroke (Attia et al.  2007 ; Wiklund et al.  2005 ). PAI-1 gene is located on the human chromosome 7 at q21,3-q22 position (Follo and Ginsburg 1989 ). It has been reported that PAI-1 rs1799889 was associated with ischemic stroke in the Han Chinese population (Xu et al.  2008 ). Besides, previous report also showed an association of PAI-1 rs1799889 4G/4G genotype with elevated plasma PAI-1 levels (Mansfield et al.  1995 ). Similarly, rs7242, located in the   $3^{\prime}$  -untranslated region (  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR) of PAI-1, has been reported to be associated with myocardial infarction risk (Morange et al.  2007 ). In addition, the polymorphism at the position -844 (rs2227631) was found to be significantly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) among non-smokers (Su et al.  2006 ). However, the functions of the three SNPs, rs1799889, rs7242, and rs2227631, are still not fully clear, and so far, no study of them for stroke in COC users has been reported.  

To further examine the association of PAI-1 gene variants with the risk of stroke, we genotyped these three SNPs (rs1799889, rs7242 and rs2227631) in stroke patients and controls among Chinese women and evaluated the combined effects between COC use with these variants and stroke risk.  

# Materials and Methods  

Study Subjects  

This nested case-control study was on the basis of a prospective surveillance cohort established in 1997 in Jiangsu Province, China (Li et al.  2006 ). A total of 1,372 subjects for the distributions of genotype analysis were consecutively recruited, including 453 first-ever female stroke cases (cerebral hemorrhage, sub ara ch noid hemorrhage, and cerebral infarc- tion) and 919 controls (neighborhoods and hospitalized patients), from the cohort between July 1997 and June 2009 in the Taicang County of Suzhou City and Rudong County of Nantong City in Jiangsu Province, China. All the stroke patients were definitively diagnosed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral angiography, and lumbar puncture, and those having transitory ischemic attack or having lacunar infarction were excluded. All the controls were exactly matched to the cases on age (3- year interval) and region, which were absence of stroke and other cardio-cerebro vascular diseases including VTE and MI. The details on inclusion and exclusion criteria for cases and controls were clearly described in our previous study (Li et al. 2010 ). All of these cases and controls were unrelated ethnic Han Chinese women.  

After signing informed consent, each participant was scheduled for a face-to-face interview by using a standard questionnaire to collect information on demographic data, medical history, family history, reproductive history, cigarette and alcohol consumption, and results of clinical examinations and laboratory tests. Women who used COC continuously for more than 3 months were defined as COC users. In addition, individuals who smoked one cigarette per day for over 1 year were considered as smokers, and those who consumed one or more alcohol drinks a week for over 6 months were categorized as alcohol drinkers. After interview, approximately   $6\,\mathrm{{ml}}$  of venous blood sample was collected from each participant for lipid tests and genotyping assays. Definitions of hypertension and hyper lipid emi a were consistent as before (Li et al. 2010 ). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight   $(\mathrm{kg})/$  height   $(\mathrm{m}^{2})$  . This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nanjing Medical University.  

Genotyping  

Genomic DNA was isolated by proteinase K digestion and followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. SNP rs1799889 4G/5G was detected by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the following primers  $(5^{\prime}{>}3^{\prime})$  : forward: A A GC TTT TAC CAT G GTA A CCCC TG GT, reverse: T GC A GCC A GCC A CGT GAT T GTC TAG, 4G: GTC TG GAC A CGT GG GG A, 5G: GTC TG GAC A CGT GG GGG. SNPs rs7242 and rs222631 were genotyped on the Taqman Genotyping System (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers ’  protocols. Genotyping was carried out without knowing the subjects ’ case or control status, and two negative controls which included in each 384-well reaction plate were used for quality control. The genotyping results were read using the Sequence Detection System software (SDS, version 2.3; Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA). Those samples testing with inconsistent or unsuccessful genotyping results were repeated until agreements were reached. Repeated experiments were performed in  $10~\%$   random samples, and the agreements were   $100\ \%$  . The genotyping success rates of three polymorphism variants were approximately equal to  $99\ \%$  .  

Statistical Analysis  

Data were coded after double checks and then entered into a database using Epidata 3.1 software by two different researchers for further analysis. Hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke cases were combined as overall stroke cases and then compared with the controls. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested by a goodness-of-fit    $\chi^{2}$    test to compare the observed genotype frequencies with the expected ones among the control subjects. Non-paired  $t$   test or one-way analysis of variance was used for continuous data, and    $\chi^{2}$    test was used for categorical data. Cochran-Armitage approach was used for tendency test. Linkage d is equilibrium (LD) parameters, including  $r^{2}$    and  $D'$  , were determined by Haploview 4.2. Conditional logistics regression model was applied to evaluate the association between the alleles or genotypes and stroke by computing the odds ratio (ORs) and   $95\;\%$   confident intervals (CIs). Haplotype frequencies were estimated based on the observed alleles or genotypes using PHASE 2.0 software. Values of  $P\!<\!0.05$   in a two-sided test were considered statistically significant. All of the statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Analysis System software (v.9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).  

# Results  

Basic Characteristics  

Selected clinical characteristics of the 453 female stroke patients and 919 controls are summarized in Table  1 . There were no statistically significant differences in age structure, educational level, occupation character, and cigarette and alcohol consumption between two groups   $_{(P>0.05)}$  . However, about  $25.94\,\%$   of the stroke cases reported a family history of stroke, which was significantly higher than that of the controls  $(13.74\ \%)$     $(P{<}0.01)$  ). The percentages of the levels of BMI, the prevalence of hypertension, and hyper lipid emi a in stroke cases were higher than those of controls  $(P{<}0.01)$  . We adjusted for these con founders to avoid confounding effects from these known cardiovascular risk factors in the association study.  

Associations of PAI-1 Gene Polymorphisms with the Risk of Stroke  

All genotype distributions were consistent with the HardyWeinberg equilibrium in both stroke cases and controls, and the success rate of genotyping was above  $99\,\%$  . The genotype distributions of the three SNPs are shown in Table  2 . After adjusting the cardiovascular risk factors, these three variants were not significantly associated with stroke risk between overall stroke cases and controls. To further test the modifying effects of SNPs on the risk of stroke with different stroke subtypes, we performed subtype analyses by hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes. As showed in Table  3 , rs1799889 was significantly associated with ischemic stroke risk (5G5G vs. 4G4G OR  $=\!0.35$  ,   $95\;\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.18{-}0.67$  ; dominant model  $\mathrm{OR}\!=$  0.69,  $95~\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.47{-}0.96$  ; recessive model   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.42$  ,   $95~\%$   $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.22{-}0.78\rangle$  ). Moreover, the 5G allele of the PAI-1 4G/5G promoter polymorphism conferred a protective effect against ischemic stroke while 4G allele conferred an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, none of the statistically significant associations was observed between two other SNPs (rs7242, rs2227631) and the risk of stroke with different subtypes.  

# Associations Between COC Use and the Risk of Stroke  

We then used Cochran-Artimage tendency test to test the associations between COC use and the risk of stroke. The results showed that the risk of stroke gradually increased with the increasing cumulative time of COC use in women (  $(P_{\mathrm{tend}}<$  0.0001) (supporting Fig.  1 ). Compared with non-users, the risk of stroke significantly increased among those with a cumulative time of COC use 15 – 20 and    ${\geq}20$   years (  $(\mathrm{OR}\,=$  1.47,   $95\ \%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.94{-}2.30$  ;   $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.07$  ,   $95\ \%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.30{-}3.29$  , respectively). Similarly, the COC users had a 1.31-fold (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=$  1.31,   $95~\%$   $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.01$  – 1.71) increased risk of stroke compared with the non-users. Moreover, COC use was significantly associated not with ischemic stroke   $(P_{\mathrm{tend}}{=}0.0014)$  ) but with hemorrhagic stroke subtype   $(P_{\mathrm{tend}}{<}0.0001)$  ).  

Combined Effects of PAI-1 Gene Polymorphisms and COC Use on Stroke Risk  

In stratified analyses, the combined effects were detected not in hemorrhagic stroke but in ischemic stroke (supporting Table  3 ). Compared with the non-users with wild-type genotypes, COC users with rs1799889 4G5G/5G5G genotype had a decreased risk of ischemic stroke   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.53$  ,   $95\ \%$     $\mathrm{CI=}$  0.34 – 0.83) after adjustment for covariates. Neither combined effects of COC use and of PAI-1 gene variants of rs7242 and rs2227631 on stroke risk nor the gene-gene interactions were observed.

Haplotype Frequencies Constituted with Polymorphisms of Three SNPs on Stroke Risk  

The haplotypes should be more informative than individual genotypes for clarifying disease-causing mechanisms. According to this assumption, we performed haplotype analysis to assess the effect of haplotype containing PAI-1 variant alleles (supporting Table  4 ). Pairwise LD measures and correlation coefficients between PAI-1 polymorphisms were analyzed. None of our SNPs were high in LD   $(r^{2}{\leq}0.33)$  . Haplotype G-4G-T was the most frequent and was thus chosen as the baseline. As expected, haplotype G-5G-T was associated with an increased risk of overall stroke   $\mathrm{{OR}}\!=\!1.28$  ,  $95\;\%\,\mathrm{CI}=$  1.01 – 1.62). In contrast, haplotype A-4G-G and haplotype G5G-T were significantly associated with the protection from ischemic stroke   $\mathrm{{OR}{=}0.61}$  ,   $95\ \%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.46{-}0.82$  ;   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.61$  ,  $95\ \%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.44{-}0.85$  , respectively). In addition, other haplotypes were significantly associated with the decreased risk of susceptibility to ischemic stroke (  $\mathrm{{CR}}{=}0.37$  ,   $95~\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.20-$  0.69). However, after adjustment for covariates, all haplotypes failed to show a significant difference between controls and hemorrhagic stroke patients.  

# Discussion  

In this study, we examined the associations of three SNPs (rs1799889, rs7242, and rs2227631) with stroke risk in the Han Chinese women. Our results suggested that rs1799889, but not the other SNPs, was significantly associated with ischemic stroke. The polymorphism of PAI-1 rs1799889 5G allele might confer a protective effect against ischemic stroke while 4G allele confers an increased risk of ischemic stroke. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the associations between COC use and PAI-1 gene variants with stroke risk in the Han Chinese women.  

A common unitary guanine nucleotide insertion/deletion is rs1799889 polymorphism which locates in the promoter region of PAI-1 that affects transcription of the gene. Subjects homozygous for the 4G allele have the highest and 5G homozygotes have the lowest PAI-1 levels (Hamsten and Eriksson 1995 ; Festa et al.  2003 ). High levels of PAI-1 contribute to at hero thrombosis by effecting processes of smooth muscle cell proliferation, plaque, and matrix remodeling (Roest and Banga  2003 ). Numerous studies have shown that inheritance of the 4G/4G genotype conferred an increased risk of ischemic stroke (Babu et al.  2012 ; Sirgo et al.  2006 ; Vergouwen et al. 2004 ); however, others discover no association (Balcerzyk et al.  2011 ; de Paula et al.  2011 ) or even a negative association (Saidi et al.  2007 ; Bon co rag lio et al.  2006 ; Hindorff et al. 2002 ). In Fernandez-Cadenas ’ s study, it was discovered that rs1799889 4G/4G genotype was associated with ischemic

stroke (Fernandez-Cadenas et al.  2010 ). Similarly, Wiklund et al. reported that 4G allele had been associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (Wiklund et al.  2005 ).  

Moreover, a meta-analysis suggested that the  $4\mathrm{G}/4\mathrm{G}$   genotype should be a risk factor for ischemic stroke in Han Chinese, which was consistent with our observations (  $\mathrm{Xu}$   et al.  2008 ).

The two remaining SNPs, rs7242 and rs2227631, were also confirmed to be relevant with the risk of stroke; however, our results failed to show such associations with the risk of stroke as a whole entity or with the distinct etiologies of stroke in a Chinese population. To date, very few data are available on the relationships between these SNPs and stroke, but both polymorphisms were investigated in relation to other vascular diseases. In a previous report of the HIFMECH study, the rs7242 G allele was more frequent in myocardial infarction cases than in controls (Morange et al.  2007 ). Similarly, it is noteworthy that we have previously reported that rs2227631 A allele increased the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) among non-smokers in a Chinese population (Su et al.  2006 ).  

However, Adamski et al. suggested that rs2227631 PAI-1 gene polymorphism was not observed to be associated with a particular etiology of ischemic stroke (Adamski et al.  2009 ).  

COC use is considered for stroke development in women. The WHO Studies examined the association between COC use and ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. The overall odds ratio of ischemic stroke was 2.99 in Europe and 2.93 in the developing countries; in addition, the odds ratio of hemorrhagic stroke was 1.76 in the developing countries (WHO Collaborative Study of Cardiovascular Disease and Steroid Hormone Contraception  1996a ,  b ). In addition,  Rantanen et al. found that COC use was associated with a 2.75-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke, and this systematic review

also reported that the association reached significance in 11 studies among the 16 studies which discovered a positive association between COC use and ischemic stroke risk. Moreover, the risk was significantly elevated for all dosages; however, small estrogen dosages were associated with lower risk (Rantanen and Tatlisumak  2013 ). Our previous casecontrol study revealed that women taking COC had an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke by 2.23 times (Wang et al. 2012 ). Our findings further proved that COC users had a 1.83- fold increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke, corresponding to our previous works very well.  

A previous study suggested that combined effects of COC use and factor V Leiden or pro thro mb in mutation significantly increased the risk of venous thr ombo embolism (van Vlijmen et al.  2011 ). In addition, two studies have reported COC use as a contributing factor to the risk of stroke in women with gene polymorphisms of GWAS and renin-angiotensin system (Wang et al.  2012 ; Li et al.  2010 ). Thus, the major finding in the present study was that the risk of stroke with 4G allele of the PAI-1 4G/5G promoter polymorphism was significantly increased after adjustment for covariates, relative to the observed risk during COC use. Homo zy gos it y for the 4G allele accounts for increased PAI-1 levels throughout life, and estrogen can also decrease PAI-1 levels and activities at the same time. Furthermore, the reduction in PAI-1 levels and greater fi bri no ly tic potential associated with higher estrogen status may result in some of the protection against cardiovascular disease among pre menopausal women as well as postmenopausal women receiving estrogen replacement therapy (Hindorff et al.  2002 ). However, the mechanism of the combined effects of PAI-1 polymorphisms and COC use with stroke is still not clear.  

Haplotype analysis further confirmed our results and identified a positive association between the risk haplotype G-5GT with overall stroke and the protective haplotype A-4G-G and haplotype G-5G-Twith ischemic stroke, which suggested that these two loci might have a joint effect on stroke. In addition, other haplotypes were significantly associated with the decreased risk of the susceptibility to ischemic stroke. Compared with the most frequent haplotype G-4G-T, haplotype G-5G-T was an independent risk predictor of ischemic stroke. These two haplotypes differed only by the 5G alleles. The haplotype containing the 5G allele shows a protective effect on ischemic stroke, consistent with our logistic regression analysis. Further fine mapping studies should be carried out to explore the possible mechanisms.  

A potential limitation of this study was that the dose of estrogen was not contained in our analysis while the dose of estrogen has been regarded to be most directly related to the adverse effects of COC use. Besides, the modest sample size limited the potential to explore associations with alleles with a smaller effect although the sample size was more than estimation so as to provide sufficient power. Therefore, our evidence was not powerful to demonstrate the involvement of rs7242 and rs2227631 in stroke risk. Furthermore, subtype and interaction analyses were associated with reduced sample size and statistical power, so related results should be explained with caution.  

In summary, this study suggested that the 5G allele of the PAI-1 4G/5G promoter polymorphism might confer a protective effect against ischemic stroke while 4G allele confers an increased risk of ischemic stroke in the Han Chinese women. Furthermore, the combined effects of PAI-1 polymorphisms and COC use showed that 5G allele was associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke. Further studies based on a large sample or another independent sample are needed to confirm our findings.
