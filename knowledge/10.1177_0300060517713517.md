# Abstract  

Objective:  Given its effects on lipid metabolism, the apo lipoprotein A1-C3-A5 ( APOA1-C3-A5 ) gene cluster is thought to play an important role in ischemic stroke pathogen es is. Here, we evaluated whether the  APOA1-C3-A5  cluster is associated with ischemic stroke in the northern Chinese Han population.  

Methods:  This case–control study analyzed 812 patients with ischemic stroke and 844 healthy controls with regard to four  APOA1-C3-A5  cluster promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs670, rs2854116, rs2854117, and rs662799, using the SNaPshot Multiplex sequencing assay. Potential associations among ischemic stroke, genotyping, and allele frequencies were assessed.  

Results:  APOA1  rs670 CT/TT genotypes,  APOA5  rs662799 AG/GG genotypes, and the  APOC3 rs2854116 CC genotype were associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke according to multivariate logistic analysis after adjusting for confounding factors. A significantly increased risk for ischemic stroke was also identified among high-risk haplotypes (C-C-T-A and T-T-C-A) for rs670– rs2854116–rs2854117–rs662799.  

Conclusion:  This study showed that rs670, rs2854116, and rs662799 SNPs of the  APOA1-C3-A5 cluster are associated with ischemic stroke in the northern Chinese Han population.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a leading cause of death world  wide. Ischemic stroke, which is the most common form, occurs as a result of local cerebral ischemia caused by an obstruction within a brain-supplying blood vessel. Ischemic stroke is a complex disease that involves many risk factors, including genetic variants and environmental factors. The search for the genetic factors that increase ischemic stroke risk may facilitate the development of novel and eﬀective approaches to identify high-risk groups. However, we have identiﬁed only a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as rs5128 in Apo lipoprotein C3

 ( APOC3 ), rs266729 in a dip one ct in  

 ( ADIPOQ ), and rs2108622 in cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily F member 2   ( CYP4F2 ), that are associated with susceptibility to ischemic stroke in large-scale genome-wide association studies.  

Dys lipid emi a often occurs in patients with ischemic stroke. Lipids and lipoproteins have been traditionally associated with atherosclerosis in carotid arteries, which is the leading cause of ischemic stroke. Atherosclerosis often begins with an endothelial injury that makes the endothelium susceptible to the accumulation of lipids and the deposition of thrombus. The apolipoprotein A1-C3-A5 ( APOA1-C3-A5 ) gene cluster on chromosome 11q23 (Apo11q) is among the most well-characterized regions of the human genome because of its dynamic association with plasma lipids and lipoprotein s. Moreover, its associated haplotypes are highly informative genetic markers in diseases related to hyperlipidemia. Four promoter SNPs, rs670, rs2854116, rs2854117, and rs662799 in the APOA1-C3-A5 cluster are strongly associated with dys lipid emi a through their inﬂuence of triglyceride (TG) and very low  density lipoprotein levels. Because dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for ischemic stroke, the genes involved in dys lipid emi a might be candidates for assessing ischemic stroke susceptibility. Although individual genetic variants within the Apo11q gene cluster have been independently associated with   ischemic stroke in some studies, researchers drew diﬀerent conclusions and no studies have beenableto establisha direct association between haplotypes and the risk of ischemic stroke.Owing to the functional and positional relevance, it is necessary to examine the entire APOA1-C3-A5  cluster as a whole.  

We performed a hospital-based case– control study of 812 patients with ischemic stroke and 844 control participants. We analyzed the relationship between ischemic stroke and four SNPs (rs670, rs2854116, rs2854117, and rs662799) in the promoter of the  APOA1-C3-A5  cluster in the northern Chinese Han population.  

# Discussion  

The present study evaluated the association between ischemic stroke risk and four functional polymorphisms within the promoter region of the  APOA1-C3-A5  cluster among a northern Chinese Han sample of 812 ischemic stroke cases and 844 controls. Our ﬁndings suggest that the rs670 CT/TT genotypes in  APOA1 , the rs662799 AG/GG genotypes in  APOA5 , and the rs2854116 CC genotype in  APOC3  are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Furthermore, we identiﬁed a sign i cant ly

increased risk of ischemic stroke among the high-risk haplotypes (C-C-C-A and T-T-CA) for rs670–rs2854116–rs2854117– rs662799. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to describe the role of the  APOA1-C3-A5  cluster promoter SNPs with regard to the prevalence of ischemic stroke. Moreover, it is also the ﬁrst to conduct a haplotype analysis of the northern Chinese Han population.  

Previous studies have demonstrated that the SNPs located in the  APOA1-C3-A5 cluster are associated with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and card i ovas cular disease in several ethnic populations. The APOA1-C3-A5  cluster has also been associated with dys lipid emi a in many stu-   dies. In a Taiwanese population, the haplotype containing the minor alleles of APOA5  rs662799 and  APOA1  rs670 was more prevalent among cases than controls and was sign i cant ly associated with the risk   of hyper triglyceride mia, whereas  APOA5 rs662799 had a signiﬁcant and independent eﬀect on serum TG concentrations in a Japanese population.  

Regarding the association of the APOA1-C3-A4-A5  cluster with metabolic   syndrome, a previous study showed that participants who carry the minor allele of APOA1  rs670 had an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome compared   with participants with the GG genotype. A meta-analysis found that European and Chinese individuals with the C allele of APOA5  rs662799 were at a  $33\%$   and   $40\%$  increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome, respectively. Furthermore,  APOA5 rs662799 was reported to interact with the environmental factors associated with metabolic syndrome.  

The relationship between  APOC3  promoter polymorphisms and a predisposition to insulin resistance has been underscored in a number of studies that identiﬁed variants rs2854116 and rs2854117 as having a greater likelihood of insulin resistance compared   with wild-type. APOC3  promoter polymorphisms were also associated with coron  ary artery disease, while  APOA1  rs670 is a risk marker for coronary artery disease and 27 myocardial infarction among the Indian   and Japanese populations, respectively. Interestingly, the C allele of APOA5 rs662799 was previously associated with higher levels of TG and TG/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in coronary heart disease and with higher Gensini scores in women only, indicating some degree of gender speciﬁcity in the eﬀect of genetic variation. However, little was known about the interactions between  APOA1-

C3-A5  polymorphisms and ischemic stroke. Consistent with previous results regarding these functional SNPs, our ﬁndings suggest that  $\mathrm{T}$   allele carriers of  APOA1  (rs670), C allele carriers of  APOC3  (rs2854116), and G allele carriers of  APOA5  (rs662799) are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke  

The mechanism that underlies the associations between these genetic variants and ischemic stroke is unknown. Functional APOA1-C3-A5  SNPs mediate the widely replicated associations with hyper trig lyc eridemia and low HDL cholesterol; these SNPs have been studied extensively because they can alter the nuclear transcription factors that mediate apoprotein formation. However, previous reports found that rs662799 had no eﬀect on relative luciferase expression, and no transcriptional factors mapped to this     site. Cui et al. conducted experiments using human lung ﬁbroblasts with a heterozygous genotype (rs2266788 CT) and conﬁrmed the eﬀects of microRNA 3201 binding to the    $A P O A5\quad3^{\prime}$  untranslated region and subsequent APOA5 expression.  

Given previous knowledge about high linkage d is equilibrium between rs2266788 and rs662799, we suppose that the eﬀect of rs662799 variation on ischemic stroke is likely attributable to rs2266788 as a causal variant. Moreover, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that  APOA1-C3-

A5  haplotypes aﬀect TG and HDL cholesterol because they are in linkage disequilib  rium. These ﬁndings suggest that some serum lipid parameters are partially inﬂuenced by interactions between  ApoA1- C3-A5  haplotypes, and that these features together contribute to increased individual ischemic stroke susceptibility.  APOA1-C3- A5  polymorphisms might enhance the conformation or function of the apoprotein  

related to hyper triglyceride mia, which might in turn explain why our participants were at a high risk of ischemic stroke if they were carriers of the T allele of  APOA1  (rs670), the T allele of  APOA3  (rs2854116), or the G allele of  APOA5  (rs662799). Ding et al previously analyzed the inﬂuence of rs662799 on the serum lipid proﬁle, and reported that it was correlated with TG levels, but not independently related with ischemic stroke risk in the studied Turkish   subjects. This discrepancy could reﬂect diﬀerences in geographical ethnic groups, genetic backgrounds, diseases, age, sample sizes, study design, or the selection pattern of samples between the two studies.  

Our study has some shortcomings that should be recognized. First, its sample size was small, and in the absence of large-scale investigations into the role of  APOA1-C3- A5  in ischemic stroke, it remains unclear whether our ﬁndings apply to other ethnic populations. Second, ischemic stroke is a complex disease, and the eﬀects of multiple genes and environmental factors were not evaluated in the present study. Finally, our study should be considered preliminary and the results need to be conﬁrmed in more detailed expression and translational studies.  

In summary, we demonstrated that common variants of  APOA1 ,  APOC3 , and APOA5  are associated with ischemic stroke, indicating that APOA1-C3-A5 variants sign i cant ly predict a high ischemic stroke risk. Furthermore, the APOA1-C3-A5 haplotypes sign i cant ly aﬀect the risk of ischemic stroke among the northern Chinese Han population. Variations of these genes may serve as useful genetic markers to diagnose ischemic stroke.  

# Materials and methods  

Samples  

We recruited 812 patients with ischemic stroke and 844 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Patient data were collected from the Department of Neurology at the First Aﬃliated Hospital of China Medical University between June 2014 and December 2015. Individuals ranged in age from 40 to 80 years old. Patients were identiﬁed as eligible if they were receiving their ﬁrst diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke based on a neurological examination and radiological imaging. These diagnoses included the sudden onset of a focal neurological deﬁcit that persisted for more than   $24\,\mathrm{h}$   with a corresponding infarction on brain imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Patients with transient ischemic attack, cerebral embolism, cerebral trauma, cerebro vascular malformations, coagulation disorders, autoimmune dis- eases, tumors, or chronic infectious diseases were excluded. Cases with renal or liver diseases, he mato path y, occlusive arterial disease, or ph lebo thrombosis of the limbs were also excluded. The controls were recruited from the Physical Examination Department of the First Aﬃliated Hospital of China Medical University. None of the controls showed evidence of stroke or other neurological diseases. Control participants with tumors, autoimmune diseases, liver ailments, nephrosis, or hematological diseases were excluded. All participants were of Han ethnicity and lived in Liaoning Province, northern China. Clinical records, including general condition (gender, age, BMI, ethnicity, history of smoking, and alcohol use), past history of diabetes and hypertension, serum TG, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and HDL, were collected from patients and controls. Brain CT or MRI, echo car dio graph y, carotid ultrasound, trans cranial Doppler, and electro cardiogram examinations were also required for all patients. BMI was categorized based on the Asian class i cation of obesity, such that a   $\mathrm{BMI}>22.9\$   was considered overweight. Hyper lipid emi a was  

deﬁned as a total plasma cholesterol level of

  $5.72\,\mathrm{mmol/L}$  , a plasma TG level of

  $1.7\,\mathrm{mmol/L}$  , or the current use of lipidlowering drugs. The Institutional Ethical Committee of the First Aﬃliated Hospital of China Medical University approved this study, and it was conducted according to the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.  

# SNP selection  

Well-studied or functional SNPs were selected based on previous studies that documented associations between SNPs in the Apo lipoprotein    $A P O A I{·}C3{–}A5$   cluster and dys lipid emi a or its components. These   SNPs included  APOA1  rs670, APOC3   rs2854116, APOC3  rs2854117,   and  APOA5  rs662799. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of these four SNPs was    $>0.05$   in the Chinese Han population.  

# DNA extraction and genotyping  

Genomic DNA was extracted from   $200\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$  of EDTA-anti coagulated peripheral blood using a DNA Pur i cation Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). DNA purity was measured via spectrophotometry, and DNA samples were stored at  $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Genotypes were analyzed using the SNaPshot Multiplex Kit (Applied Biosystems Co., Ltd., Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences of PCR primers are shown in Table 5. SNaPshot reactions were performed in a ﬁnal volume of   $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$  , including   $5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of the SNaPshot Multiplex Kit (ABI),  $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of primer mix,  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of water, and   $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of templates, which consisted of the multiplex PCR products for the diﬀerent genes. The SNaPshot reaction procedures were as follows: initial de natura tion at  $96^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for   $1\,\mathrm{{min}}$  , then 28 cycles of de natura tion at

$96^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $10\,\mathrm{s}$  , annealing at  $55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $5\,\mathrm{s}$  , and extension at   $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,\mathrm{s}$  . Ampliﬁed samples were stored at  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Extension products were puriﬁed over a 1-h incubation period with   $1~\mathrm{~U~}$   of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) at   $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , followed by incubation at   $75^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $15\,\mathrm{{min}}$   to inactivate the enzyme. Puriﬁed products  $(0.5\,\upmu\mathrm{L})$   were mixed with   $9\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of   $\mathrm{Bi-Di}$  and   $0.5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of the Liz120 size standard (Applied Biosystems Co., Ltd.). Samples were incubated at   $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for   $5\,\mathrm{{min}}$   and then loaded onto an ABI 3130XL DNA sequence detector for capillary electrophoresis. Experimental results were analyzed using GeneMapper 4.0 (Applied Biosystems Co., Ltd.).  

# Statistical analyses  

All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS)  $\mathrm{v}20.0$   if not otherwise speciﬁed. All tests were two-tailed, and sign i can ce was deﬁned as   $\mathrm{P}\,{<}\,0.05$  . Pearson’s    $\chi^{2}$  -test was used to compare the distribution of demographic variables and to examine the diﬀerences in risk factors and genotypes with regard to alleles and haplotypes between cases and controls. For each genotype, HWE was tested with a goodness-of-ﬁt  $\chi^{2}$  -test. An unconditional logistic regression was performed to calculate the ORs and  $95\%$   CIs to estimate the association between certain genotypes and ischemic stroke. Given the sample size of 812 cases and 844 controls, assuming a genotypic relative risk for a recessive model of 2, an MAF of 0.2, a  $1.88\%$   population prevalence of ischemic stroke, and a Type I error probability of

 0.05, we would be unable to reject the null esis that   $\mathrm{OR}=1$   with a power of

 88.62%. Based on the observed frequencies of the four SNPs, we used the SHEsis analysis platform to calculate linkage disequilibrium indices   $\mathrm{{}_{.}D^{\prime}}$    and   $\mathrm{r}^{2}$  ) and infer haplotype frequencies.  

# Results  

We identiﬁed 812 patients with ischemic stroke and 844 controls. The general charact eris tics of these participants are summarized in Table 1. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found between controls and patients with regard to age or gender. However, a higher prevalence of conventional risk factors for ischemic stroke, such as body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking history, and alcohol use, was observed among patients with ischemic stroke compared with the control group.  

Genotype and allele frequencies of the four SNPs among patients and controls are shown in Table 2. All allele distributions were consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).  

As shown in Table 2, neither the genotype nor the allele frequencies of  APOA1  rs670 diﬀered sign i cant ly between patients and controls. However, compared with combined variant genotypes   $(\mathrm{CT}+\mathrm{TT})$  , the rs670 TT genotype sign i cant ly increased susceptibility to ischemic stroke under a recessive genetic model (odds ra  $[\mathrm{OR}]\!=\!2.28$     $95\%$  - dence interval [CI]  $\mathrm{[CI]}\,{=}\,1.52–3.44$  ¼  $\mathrm{P}<0.001$  Table 2). Similar results were also found for the genotypes of  APOA5  rs662799. Under a recessive model, the APOA5 rs662799 GG genotype was associated with a higher ischemic stroke risk  $(\mathrm{OR}=1.91$   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.35–2.69$  ,  $\mathrm{P}<0.001$  Table 2). Analyses of APOC3 rs2854117 and rs2854117 polymorphisms found no signiﬁ- cant associations with ischemic stroke under any of the genetic models (Table 2).  

Additional analyses were performed using multiple logistic regression, and more signiﬁcant results were found after adjusting for confounding factors. Using the lowest-risk genotype   $(A P O A I\;\;\mathrm{rs}670\;\;\mathrm{CC})$   as a reference, we identiﬁed a sign i cant ly increased risk for ischemic stroke among the high-risk rs670 genotypes CT and TT (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.571$   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.103-$  6, P  $\mathrm{P}\,{=}\,0.003$   ¼  0.003 and adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=5.175$  , 95%   $\operatorname{CI}=3.042–8.807$  ,   $\mathrm{P}<0.001$  , respectively) (Table 3). The association between an increased risk of ischemic stroke and the homozygous variant  APOA5  rs662799 GG genotype and the heterozygous variant AG a d  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.435$  ,  $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=1.065–1.934$     $\mathrm{P}\,{=}\,0.004$  and  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,2.079$   ¼  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.311–3.294$   ¼  $\mathrm{P}\,{=}\,0.001$   ¼  0.001 for GG) (Table 3). Compared with the  APOC3  rs2854116 TT homozygote, the CC homozygote was associated with a sign i cant ly increased risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,2.428$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.033–5.709$  , P  $\mathrm{P}\,{=}\,0.031$   ¼  0.031) (Table 3)  

The four SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium in this sample (i.e.,   $\mathrm{D}'>0.8$   or  $\mathrm{r}2>0.4)$  ). Of all possible haplotypes, only six showed a frequency of    $\mathord{>}0.03$   among both cases and controls, and were included in the haplotype analysis. These six haplotypes represented  $96.5\%$   of the chromosomes of the cases and   $95.2\%$   of those of the controls. No diﬀerence was observed in the overall haplotype distribution between cases and controls. Haplotype analysis revealed that the frequencies of the C-C-T-A and T-T-C-A haplotypes of rs670–rs2854116– rs2854117–rs662799 were sign i cant ly higher  

ng ntr  $(\mathrm{OR}\,\!=\!1.340$  ,  $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=1.138–1.579$  ¼  $\mathrm{P}<0.001$  and

  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.547$   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.230–1.945$  ,

  $\mathrm{P}<0.001\$   0.001) (Table 4).
