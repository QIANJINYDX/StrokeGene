Results:  Signi ﬁ cantly higher NOx levels were observed in controls [controls  $56.63\pm25.92\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L},$   patients  $34.73\,\pm\,19.88\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$  ,  $\mathsf{p}<0.001$  ]. The SNPs [single nucleotide polymorphisms] 894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A were found associated with the disease phenotype with the most signi ﬁ cant  ﬁ nding observed for 894G/T   $\left[\chi^{2}=36.68\right.$  ,   $\mathsf{p}<0.001\}$  ]. The SNPs 894G/T and 2479G/A were signi ﬁ cantly associated with NOx levels  $[{\tt p}=0.001]$  ]. The haplotypes TCA and TGA were overrepresented in the patient population   $\left[\mathsf{p}<0.0001\right]$  . Conclusion:  Two  NOS3  SNP [894G/T and 2479G/A] variants and NOx levels are associated with ischemic stroke in young Asian Indians. These  NOS3  SNPs might represent genetic risk factors for ischemic stroke in young Asian Indians. However these observations need to be con ﬁ rmed by larger replicate/cross-sectional studies.

important for the prevention of IS. Amongst these genes the endo the li al nitric oxide synthase [ NOS3 ] gene which is responsible for endo the li al nitric oxide [NO] production is of considerable importance. Nitric oxide is pivotal in sustaining vascular homeostasis by maintaining basal cerebral blood  ﬂ ow  [4] , cerebral va so dilation and auto- regulation  [5,6] , vascular integrity  [7]  and inhibiting smooth muscle proliferation  [8] . It inhibits atherosclerosis by reducing the adhesion of platelets and leukocytes and increasing endo the li al permeability and extracellular matrix collagen synthesis  [7,9,10] . The  NOS3  gene is located on chromosome 7q35 – 36 and comprises 26 exons spanning  $21~\mathrm{kb}$  [11] . There is a well demonstrated genetic contribution of  NOS3  gene to plasma NO metabolite levels [NOx], with several well known single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] in the  NOS3  gene known to have involvement in the pathogen es is of various vascular diseases  [11 – 17] . The effect of these SNPs on in-vivo NO generation cannot be measured directly due to an extreme short half life of NO in vivo. NO, is rapidly oxidized to its stable metabolites [nitrates and nitrites]; and the assessment of these metabolites [NOx] is an indirect index of endogenous NO production. These metabolite levels have been previously shown to be associated with  NOS3  SNPs  [11] . However, only a limited number  

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke is a major health problem worldwide with a huge socioeconomic burden, especially when presenting in younger patients from developing countries. India has about oneﬁ fth of patients with ﬁ rst ever strokes admitted to hospitals aged  ${<}40$   years, causing a significant strain on the health management  [1] . Although extensive investigations have been carried out to understand the aetiology of this potentially devastating condition, stroke in young is characterized by heterogeneous a etiologies, which remains unknown in approximately one third of young adults and children  [2,3] . Genetic predispositions contribute as major risk in the development of polygenic ischemic stroke [IS]. Vascular anomalies arising out of genetic dysfunctions are one of the mechanisms that lead to the development of IS. The genes regulating atherosclerosis through different pathways are also  

of studies have extensively looked at the possibility of  NOS3  SNPs being a risk factor for ischemic stroke in young Asian Indian population  [18, 19] . The present study aimed at determining the role of NO levels and genetic variations in the  NOS3  promoter/exonic regions towards the development of IS in young Asian Indians.  

# 2. Material and methods  

# 2.1. Study subjects [inclusion and exclusion criteria]  

Young adults [18 – 45 years old] were recruited from outpatient clinics and wards of the Departments of Neuroscience s and Hae mat ology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. In the period between June 2009 and December 2011 we enrolled 240 consecutive young acute ischemic stroke patients that were clinically and radio logically [CT/MRI] diagnosed with non-cardio-embolic stroke. Patients had ischemic stroke, with no history of prior heart disease, normal examination of heart on a us cult ation, absence of valvular disease, valvular vegetation s and intra-mural thrombus on echo-car dio graph y and absence of history suggestive of atrial  ﬁ brillation, normal ECG (electrocardiograph y) and Holter exam. Also, CT (computed tomography) investigations indicated the absence of multiple infarcts in different vascular territories. Patients exclusively of North-Indian origin were included in the study. Patients with cardioembolic strokes or having a history of cardiovascular disease, hemorrhagic stroke, systemic disease, cancer and hae mato logical disorder were excluded from the study. Patients on oral anticoagulant or on any medication [aspirin, antibiotics, contraceptives or steroids] were included in the study only if they were off the medication for a minimum period of two weeks [from the time of sampling]. No paediatric patients were part of the study. Patients who had undergone surgery or had suffered trauma in the past 30 days were also excluded. Only patients who reported for at least one subsequent follow up after 3 – 6 months were included in the  ﬁ nal study. Out of 240 patients, 89 patients were lost to follow-up and 51 failed to ful ﬁ l the above indicated inclusion and exclusion criteria. Therefore, a total of 100 patient samples were included in the  ﬁ nal study. Non-related sex and age  $[\pm3$   years] matched  as much as possible  healthy individuals   $[\mathsf{n}=200]$   of north Indian origin were also included in the study to serve as the disease free control population. Controls were mainly hospital staffers, trainee and unrelated healthy patient attendants. Stroke free status for the control population was ascertained by a questionnaire [QVSFS]  [20] . Blood sampling for stroke cases was performed within 10 days of the stroke event and the  ﬁ rst follow-up was done after a period of 3 months. Plasma was isolated within  $45\;\mathrm{min}$   of sampling and stored at    $-70~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for further evaluation. The conventional risk factors [hypertension, smoking, alcoholic and hyperlipidemia] were recorded as part of patient clinical history. Participation was voluntary and all subjects gave written consent. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  

2.3. Screening for genetic variations using single stranded con ﬁ rmation polymorphism [SSCP]  

Screening of the promoter and exonic region of the  NOS3  gene [SNPs] was done by SSCP [single stranded con ﬁ rmation polymorphism] analysis. This was done to make the study cost-effective and avoid the costs that might be involved in the direct sequencing of the whole gene for the entire study population. The primers for screening the promoter region were taken from an early study  [17]  and for the exogenic regions were designed on the  NOS3  gene sequence downloaded from the Ensemble database [Ensemble ID: EN ST 00000297494] manually. A limited number of the healthy control samples   $[\Nu=40]$   were screened with SSCP analysis. The samples with abnormal mobility shift were then sequenced and then compared with the wild type sequence corresponding to the particular locus in order to characterize the base change. Sequencing of the samples was done commercially from Macrogen [Seoul, South Korea]. Individual samples were repeated at least three times to determine the consistency of the mobility shift before the samples were sequenced and characterized. The method developed by Orita et al.  [21]  was used with slight modi ﬁ cations for the SSCP analysis.

# 2.4. Genotype analysis and con ﬁ rmation  

All identi ﬁ ed variants were further genotyped in the whole study population [100 patients and 200 controls] by restriction fragment length polymorphism [RFLP] and allele speci ﬁ c PCR. The primers for this analysis were designed manually and can be made available on request. Allelic frequency comparisons were made based on data downloaded from the HAPMAP database [ http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/ ; accessed on 30.12.2012]  [22] .  

# 3. Statistics  

Categorical variables were compared using Pearson's  $\chi^{2}$    test and continuous variables were analysed using Student's t-test or analysis of variance on SPSS 13.0 [Statistical Package for the Social Sciences]. Pearson's correlation [or Spearman's rank] was used to estimate the relationship between clinical variables and NOx level. Logistic regression analysis was performed on SPSS 13.0 to evaluate the effect of SNPs after adjusting for covariates. Ha plo typing was done using Haploview 4.1  [23]  for calculating linkage d is equilibrium [LD] between SNPs and for comparing haplotypes for categorical variables. p-Values were corrected for multiple testing using permutation analysis as implemented in Haploview 4.1. UNPHASED 3.0  [24,25]  was used for investigating the association of haplotypes with the NOx level. This was done on UNPHASED 3.0 with a 3-marker sliding window.

# 4.1. NOx levels  

Nitric oxide levels were evaluated indirectly by measuring its metabolites [NOx] in plasma samples. We measured total nitrite by converting nitrate to nitrite using total NO/nitrite/nitrate kits [R&D System, Minneapolis, US]. Measurement of GPx-3 antigen level was performed using Human GPx-3 ELISA kit [Adipogen Inc., Korea]. ELISA was performed strictly according to the manufacturer's instructions provided in the kit manual. Plasma NOx levels and GPx-3 antigen levels were evaluated for patients [acute and post-acute phases] and controls. The minimal detectable dose/sensitivity for the total NO/nitrite/nitrate kits was  $0.25~\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$  . The sensitivity for the Human GPx-3 ELISA kit was   $100\ \mathrm{pg/ml}$  .

Signi ﬁ cant difference in levels of NOx was seen in patient samples collected in acute phase and post-acute phase [acute phase:

  $29.77\,\pm\,22.0\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$  ; post-acute phase:   $34.73\;\pm\;19.88\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$  ;

  $\mathsf{p}<0.001\mathsf{\bar{\tau}}$  ]. No signi ﬁ cant difference was observed between NOx levels

  $[{\tt p}^{\tt<0.001}]$   and BMI   $\left[{\mathfrak{p}}<0.001\right]$  ]. Nitric oxide levels were also found to be associated with smoking   $[{\tt p}=0.03]$   and alcohol   $[{\tt p}=0.004]$  . After considering co-linearity amongst the other variables and adjusting for alcohol and LDL, NOx levels were found to be independently associated with the stroke phenotype [ Table 2 ]. Signi ﬁ cantly higher GPx-3 levels were also revealed in controls compared with patients [controls  $26.37\pm3.66\,\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$  , patients  $22.83\pm4.57\ \upmu\mathrm{g/m};$  ;  $\mathsf{p}<0.001$  ]. GPx-3 an- tigen levels showed a signi ﬁ cant positive non parametric correlation with NOx levels   $\left[{\tt p}<0.001\right.$   and Spearman's correlation coef ﬁ cient  $=$  0.2480 respectively]. Intra-assay and inter assay coef ﬁ cients of variation calculated for the NOx assay were  $3.1\%$   and  $2.3\%$   respectively while for the GPx-3 assay were  $2.56\%$   and   $1.69\%$   respectively.  

# 4.2. Genotyping of NOS3 SNPs and their effect in the NOx levels  

A total of 8 variants in the  NOS3  gene were identi ﬁ ed from the initial SSCP screening. However, none of these variants were novel and have been previously reported in different SNP databases [Seattle SNPs, ENSEMBL and dbSNP]. All the detected SNPs were in agreement with Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium, and were included in the overall analysis. The allelic frequencies observed for all the SNPs differed markedly from

Four of them were promoter   $\mathrm{{SNFS}}\left[-1474\mathrm{T/A},\right.$   $-922\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G}$  ,  − 786C/T and  $-691C/\mathrm{T}]$  894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A] were exonic SNPs located on exons 6, 7, 16 and 23. Single marker analysis association studies showed that only the last 3 markers [894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A] were signi ﬁ cantly [i.e. geno typically as well allelic ally] associated with stroke, the most signi ﬁ cant  ﬁ nding being for the 894G/T SNP   $\chi^{2}=29.80$  ,   $\mathsf{p}<0.001]$  [ Table 3 ]. A logistic regression analysis, correcting for the effect of smoking, alcohol, LDL and triglycerides was carried out. The 3 markers 894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A were still found to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with stroke [ Table 4 ]. The SNPs 894G/T and 2479G/A were significantly associated with NOx levels   ${\tt I p}=0.001$  ] with the variant homozygous genotypes TT and AA corresponding to mean values of  $31.6~\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$   and   $40.0\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$   respectively [ Table 5 ]. Therefore, two SNPs 894G/T and 2479G/A in our study showed a direct association with levels as well as stroke phenotype. The power of this study is  $85\%$     $\mathsf{\tilde{p}}<0.05\mathsf{\tilde{\Delta}}$  ) when the associated polymorphisms (894G/T 1998C/G and 2479G/A) are considered. However if all the informative polymorphisms in the study are included in the power calculation we derive a  $33\%$   power   $\left({\tt p}<0.05\right)$   for the study overall with a range between 2.5 to   $98.6\%$   for all SNPs.  

# 4.3. Haplotypic analysis of NOS3 SNPs  

Linkage d is equilibrium was not strong across the  NOS3  gene [ Fig. 3 ]; therefore haplotypic analysis was carried out using only the last 3 markers [the ones which were signi ﬁ cantly associated with stroke] on Haploview 4.1. Signi ﬁ cant association with the disease phenotype was observed for the haplotype TCA and GGA which were observed to be more frequent in patients than in controls   $\left[{\tt p}<0.001\right.$  ;  Table 6 ]. Other haplotypes were not found signi ﬁ cantly associated on different permutation tests as their frequencies were still low [ Table 6 ]. The haplotypes with a frequency  ${<}5\%$   [0.005] were not considered in the  ﬁ nal analysis. Haplotypic analysis was repeated on UNPHASED 3.1 using a 3-marker sliding window. We observed that only the haplotypes carrying the last 3 SNPs [894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A] were signi ﬁ cantly associated with NOx levels. The wild type Haplotype GCG corresponded to the second highest mean level of NOx while the haplotype TGA showed the lowest level of NOx [ Table 7 ].

A number of previous investigations reported the role of either NO levels or  NOS3  gene variation in the development of stroke. Only two

studies, to the best of our knowledge,  [11,16]  performed in Caucasians have reported the role of  NOS3  gene variations in determining the NO levels and their association with stroke. Two studies from South Asian-Indian population have also reported the association of some NOS3  gene SNPs with ischemic stroke but the studies were not elaborate and did not involve the evaluation of NO levels  [18,19] . Our present study involved a comparative assessment of NO levels and  NOS3  gene SNPs detected by SSCP, in young Asian Indian stroke patients and

apparently healthy controls of similar ethnic origin. The level of nitric oxide detected is primarily dependent upon the type of NOS isoform that is generating NO. Studies with knockout mice for each of the 3 NOS genes have also revealed that NO generated by the neuronal isoform (nNOS) and inducible isoform (iNOS) is detrimental to tissue survival and neurological outcome while NO generated by endo the li al isoform (eNOS) has protective effect in brain tissue [Wei et al.  [26] , Huang et al.  [27] ]. In our study we measured NO (metabolites) from plasma which is mainly governed by eNOS since eNOS has a protective role in ischemic stroke observed low levels of NO in plasma and is in complete agreement with the physiological role of eNOS [O'Mahony and Kendall  [28] ]. The NOx levels were signi ﬁ cantly higher in controls than in patients [ Table 2 ]. This observation is in agreement with 3 previous studies [Hassan et al.  [11] , Ta ﬁ i et al.  [29]  and Bayram et al.  [30] ]. Studies with contrary  ﬁ ndings were also reported from El-Kossi and Zakhary  [31]  and Aygul et al.  [32]  and Ci an care ill i et al.  [33]  found raised NO levels in plasma which is mainly governed by eNOS, and this discrepancy with our results may be due to low sample sizes in these earlier studies. Also differences in the study design, ethnicity and genetic diversity, inclusion criteria, environmental factors and different population sizes in our study and of other studies which can affect NO metabolism may have also led to such discrepancies observed due to higher NO levels in stroke patients, when compared to controls.  

A signi ﬁ cant difference in the NOx levels in acute and post acute phases was observed in the present study, which is indicative of an increased oxidative stress and impaired ROS metabolism which ultimately decreases NO bio availability, consequently leading to stroke. The increase in NOx levels in the post acute phase may be because of an increase in antioxidant levels. The correlation study between the levels of  ${\mathrm{GPx-3}}$   and NOx revealed a signi ﬁ cant positive correlation between the two in patients from the present study. This is in agreement with the previous studies by Freedman et al.  [34] , Kenet et al.  [35]  and Jin et al. [36] . The signi ﬁ cant positive correlation between the levels of GPx-3 and NOx in stroke patients in the present study may have arisen out of the consequence of the indirect in activation of NO by decreased GPx-3 levels. This in turn limits oxidative stress and maintains the bioavailability of NO. NO is known to interact with several reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide, to form per oxy nitrite  [11,27] . Higher concentration of superoxide allows NO to interact with superoxide radicals and alters its physiological effects  [34] . Such oxidative reactions involving NO in plasma could modify the effect of NO on platelet function and, subsequently, induce thrombosis. Freedman et al.  [34] . also found that highly reactive oxygen species rapidly inactivate plasma NO, which inhibits platelet activation. The increase in the NOx levels in post acute phase indicates a lowering of oxidative stress, which might be associated with the recovery from stroke. Our study therefore is in con ﬁ rmation with the previous observations that reduced antioxidant levels may lead to onset of stroke. The conventional vascular risk factors were signi ﬁ cantly more frequent amongst stroke patients except for hypertension. At least one conventional vascular risk factor was noticed in  $76\%$  of patient population in comparison with   $50\%$   of the control population. This indicates that conventional risk factors play a signi ﬁ cant role in the development of young ischemic stroke.  

Nitric oxide having an important role in the development of stroke, the  NOS3  gene becomes an important candidate for a genetic in ﬂ uence which might modulate/effect the outcome of stroke in young Asian Indian population. Eight SNPs of  NOS3  gene were studied to  ﬁ nd their association with NOx levels and stroke. Since, the Indian population is quite distinct from the previously studied populations; this distinct ness was re ﬂ ected in the pattern of distribution observed for the  NOS3  SNPs in our population  [11,37,38] .  Fig. 2  represents the northern and western ancestry population [CEU] which is of Caucasian origin shows the

highest degree of he ter oz y gos it y for the studied SNPs. The distribution of SNPs observed in our study is similar to the sample distribution of the CEU population from the HAPMAP database. This similarity may be re ﬂ ective of the fact that the North Asian Indian population shares ancestry with the Caucasian population much more than the South Asian Indian population because of frequent mixing. The only other sample of Asian Indian population in HAPMAP, the GIH [Gujarati Indian population], did not have adequate documented representation for our studied SNPs for making a comparison. This distinct ness is owing to the heterogeneity in the gene pool of the Asian Indian population. Out of eight SNPs studied, only 3 SNPs 894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A were found signi ﬁ cantly associated with stroke in univariate as well as multivariate analyses [ Tables 3 & 4 ]. While we observed a highly signi ﬁ cant association for the 894G/T SNP with stroke, a previous study in South Indian Population did not show any signi ﬁ cant association of this SNP with stroke. This difference can be attributed to the different ancestral origins for the populations of South and North-Indian origins  [39]  and further re ﬂ ects the genetic diversity in the Asian Indian population. Out of the 3 SNPs [894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A] two SNPs 894G/T and 2479G/A showed signi ﬁ cant association with NOx levels [ Table 5 ]. These data therefore infer that 894G/T and

2479G/A SNPs may act as the genetic risk factor in north Indian population.  

Although linkage d is equilibrium was not strong between all the studied SNPs [ Fig. 3 ], haplotypic analysis for the last three SNPs [894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A] showed a signi ﬁ cant association with the stroke phenotype. Haplotypic analysis [ Table 6 ] was carried out and it was observed that the haplotypes GGA and TCA are more common in stroke patients than in controls   $[0\tt R\approx6]$  ]. During UNPHASED 3.0 haplotypic analysis in which we used a 3-marker sliding window we also found that the haplotype carrying these three SNPs had a significant association with the NOx levels as well as with the stroke [ Table 7 ]. This is quite evident when we look at mean levels of the various haplotypes assessed by a 3-marker sliding window. The haplotypes corresponding to the highest and the lowest levels of mean NOx show differences in the genotypes for 894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A. The haplotype TGA which is composed of all the variant alleles shows the lowest levels of mean NOx [ Table 7 ]. The variants corresponding to these three SNPs which are present in the haplotype TGA for the lowest level of NOx   $[32.23\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}]$   are also overrepresented in the patient population [in the single marker analysis]. This is also evident from the haplotypic analysis done on Haploview 4.0 in which TGA was one of the haplotypes more frequent in the stroke population   $\left[\mathsf{p}<0.0001\right]$  , however since its frequency on Haploview 4.0 was  $\mathord{<\!}0.05\%$  , it has not been shown as part of the data. The haplotypes TCA and GGA which were found signi ﬁ cantly associated with the stroke phenotype also correspond to the second and third lowest levels of NOx   $[36.8\ \upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$   and 41.25]. The haplotype GCG which is composed of all the wild type alleles from the three SNPs doesn't correspond to the highest level of mean NOx but is on the higher side   $[51.55\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}]$   and is the second highest amongst all the haplotypes [ Table 7 ]. This clearly indicates that the genetic in ﬂ uence of these variations on plasma levels also translates to an effect on the disease phenotype. The data from logistic regression analysis completely agrees with the haplotypic analysis for all the SNPs [894G/T, 1998C/G and 2479G/A]. A larger population sample might show a higher degree of LD between all the 8 study SNPs and similarity in their respective associations.  

The present study therefore demonstrates a genotype dependent inﬂ uence on NOx levels in ischemic stroke patients. Although ample data is available on various aspects of the development of stroke in various ethnic populations, the present study adds to the current existing knowledge and has several strengths. First, multiple SNPs of  NOS3 were examined and the haplotypes were studied in our population, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the gene. Second, our study is the  ﬁ rst one to examine the association of  NOS3  variants along with NOx levels with stroke in an Asian Indian population. Third, this study involved the use of a young stroke population, which may have enhanced our ability to detect a genetic contribution to risk. The  ﬁ ndings from the present study therefore may be important in the management of the stroke particularly in Asian Indian population. However, there are certainly some limitations for our study. The primary limitation would be the small sample size, which is not allowed us for the subtyping of ischemic stroke and this study includes only survivors of thrombotic ischemic stroke, and the possibility of survival bias must also be considered. These limitations may be corrected in larger cross sectional replicate studies with the consideration of survival bias.
