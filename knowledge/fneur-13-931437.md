Background:  Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex neurological disease afected MMP2 by genetics and environment. Matrix metal lo protein as e-2 ( ) is involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, in amma tion and ang io genesis to regulate the development and recovery of IS.  

Purposes: The aim of this study was to explore the association of  MMP2 rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070 in  with the risk of IS in Chinese Shaanxi population.  

Methods: In this study, 677 IS patients and 681 normal controls were  MMP2 recruited. Rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070 in  were genotyped. Logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the association of  MMP2 rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070 in  with IS susceptibility and the  MMP2 association of environmental factors with  genetic susceptibility to IS.  

MMP2 Results:  The results of the overall analysis demonstrated that rs14070 in sign i cant ly reduced the risk of IS in Chinese Shaanxi population   $(\mathsf{O R}=0.767)$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}=0.619{-}0.952$  ,  $P=0.016,$  ). Subgroup analysis illustrated that rs243849  MMP2 in  evidently increased the risk of IS among drinkers, while rs14070 in MMP2  apparently reduced IS susceptibility among females, participants with aged  ${>}55$  , smokers and drinkers.  

MMP2 Conclusions:  Collectively, rs243849 and rs14070 in  were sign i cant ly associated with the risk of IS in Chinese Shaanxi population, and the efect of MMP2  to IS may be associated with its genetic susceptibility.

# Introduction  

Stroke is caused by cerebro vascular disorders, including ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS), of which IS accounts for 70 to  $90\%$   (1, 2) . High morbidity, high recurrence, high mortality, high disability and low cure rate are the main characteristics of IS  (3) . As a multi factorial complex neurological disorder, stroke involves clinical, environmental and genetic factors  (4) . Advanced age, smoking, drinking, hypertension and diabetes are the risk factors to IS    $(5,\ 6)$  . Study indicated that the incidence of IS after the age of 40 increased evidently with age, and the susceptibility of IS in male was obviously higher than that in female in the same age group  (7) . There was a signiﬁcant dose eﬀect between the numbers of daily cigarettes smoked and IS in young men  (8) . However, clinical and environmental factors do not adequately explain diﬀerences in IS disease progression  (9) . Epidemiological analysis shows genetic factors play a crucial role in IS susceptibility  (2, 6) , accounting for  $50\%$   (10) . Therefore, there is an urgent need to study the genetic variants associated with the occurrence of IS  (11) .  

Vascular in amma tion is a key factor in IS (11) . In amma tion can not only promote thrombus formation and improve the stability of thrombus, but also damage the blood-brain barrier (BBB)  (12) . Matrix metal lo protein as es (MMPs), as a class of pro teo ly tic zinc-dependent enzymes, can regulate cytokines  (13) , ang io genesis  (10) , extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation  (14) , and cause BBB disorders (4) , which aﬀect the pathogen es is of vascular in amma tion, stroke and atherosclerosis  (11) . It has been reported that the MMPs associated with IS were mainly concentrated in  MMP2 and  MMP9  (15) .  MMP2  also regulates ang io genesis, vascular in amma tion, ECM degradation, and BBB disruption, which are critical to IS occurrence, progression, and recovery  (13) . Genetic polymorphisms of  MMP2  aﬀect its transcription and expression  (10) , a preliminary study found that rs1132896 and rs243849 of  MMP2  evidently reduced the risk of IS in southern Chinese populations  (9) . However, genetic variation in  MMP2 were not notably associated with the risk of IS in the Han Hakka populations  (16) . Due to the diﬀerences in the risk correlation between  MMP2  and IS in diﬀerent populations, the study of  MMP2  polymorphisms and IS susceptibility in diﬀerent populations needs to be explored extensively.  

The purpose of this study was to investigate the eﬀect of MMP2  polymorphisms on the occurrence of IS in Chinese Shaanxi population. Three SNPs (rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070) in  MMP2  were selected and logistic regression analysis with OR and   $95\%$   CI values was used to evaluate the association between MMP2 polymorphisms and IS susceptibility. Our research results will hopefully provide valuable data support to the early prevention, diagnosis and treatment of IS, and contribute to the development of IS targeted therapy strategies.  

# Methods  

# Study participants  

The research subjects included 677 patients with IS in the acute phase (within   $24\,\mathrm{h}$   of onset) and 681 normal individuals, who were recruited from the Aﬃliated Hospital of Northwest University (Xi’an No.3 Hospital). The inclusion criteria of the IS case group were to use the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) to assess the degree of neurological deﬁcit, and to conﬁrm the diagnosis by neurological examination, brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  (16) . Patients with tumors, brain trauma, cerebral hemorrhage and cerebro vascular malformations were excluded. The control group was from patients who received physical examinations in the hospital during the same period without any family history of stroke, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease    $(3,$  17) . Trained st a administered questionnaires to participants to collect demographic data (including age, sex, smoking and drinking habits, and disease history), while collecting venous blood samples from recruiters who had fasted for at least   $8\,\mathrm{h}$  . The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of this hospital and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moreover, all participants signed an informed consent form.  

# SNPs selection and genotyping  

Three SNPs in  MMP2  (rs1053605, rs243849, and rs14070) were selected to identify  MMP2  candidate SNP variants based on NCBI database  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp) , minor allele frequency (MAF)  ${>}5\%$  , and SNP was better assessed in previous studies  (9, 18–20) . After the extraction and pur i cation of the above-mentioned sample DNA, primers for candidate SNPs (rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070) were designed based on the gene sequence of  MMP2  using Primer5.0 primer design software  (Supplementary Table 1).  Agena Mass Array and AgenaTyper 4.0 were applied for genotyping and data analysis, respectively. Five percent of DNA samples were chosen for repeat testing to control quality, with    ${\it>}99\%$   concordance of typing.  

# Statistical analysis  

$\chi^{2}$    The   test and t test were used to perform statistical data processing analysis on demographic characteristics, allele and genotype frequencies of cases and controls. The HardyWeinberg Equilibrium (HWE) method was applied to assess the overall representative ness of the sample. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs)  

![](images/c712d239a9573515daca6ec23e49167bce44af7878dc718268cf4452363cb9c7.jpg)  
 $\mathrm{{}^{a}P}$   values were calculated from independent sample t-test.  ${}^{\mathrm{b}}\mathrm{P}$   $\chi^{2}$   test.  values were calculated from two-sided  $\mathrm{P}<0.05$   indicates statistical sign i can ce.  

and   $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CIs) after strat i cation for sex, age, smoking, and drinking. The associations between SNPs and IS risk in various models (allele, co-dominant, dominant, recessive and additive) and the degree of genetic association among the three SNPs were assessed using Plink software (version 1.9). In addition, multivariate dimensionality reduction (MDR) software was used to analyze the interactions among SNPs. In this study,  $\textit{p}<0.05$   indicated a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence. STRING and Oebiotech databases were adopted to analyze the biological activity and function analysis of  MMP2 .  

# Results  

# Participant characteristics  

As depicted in  Table 1,  clinical characteristics of 677 IS patients and 681 normal control individuals included in this study. Notably, the mean age of the cases and the controls were  $54.92\ \pm\ 6.79$   and   $55.64\ \pm\ 9.12$  , respectively, and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in age between the two groups   $\textstyle P\,=\,0.099$  ). In the case group, there were 455 males   $(67.2\%)$  ) and 222 females   $(32.8\%)$   with a sex ratio of 2.05:1. The sex ratio of 446 males   $(65.5\%)$  ) and 235 females   $(34.5\%)$   in the control group was 1.90:1. Thus, there was no obvious diﬀerence in gender distribution between the two groups   $(P\,=\,0.528)$  ). Moreover, the distributions of smoking and drinking were not sign i cant ly diﬀerent between cases and controls, both    $P\,=\,0.704$  . In summary, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in clinical characteristics between the case and control groups, excluding the interference of confounding factors.  

# Candidate SNPs information and overall susceptibility  

The basic biological information of 3 SNPs (rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070) in  MMP2  was presented in  Table 2,  which included chromosomes, physical location, function, MAF and HWE. The three SNPs in  MMP2  are located on chromosome 16. Both the MAF of cases and controls and the HWE of cases were  ${\tt>}0.05$  , indicating that the selected samples were representative. Overall correlation analysis demonstrated that rs14070 in  MMP2 evidently reduced the risk of IS in multiple genetic models (Allele model:   $\mathrm{{OR}=0.809}$  ,   $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=0.679–0.964$  ,  $P=0.018$  ; Co-dominant model:   $\mathrm{{OR}=0.779}$  ,   $95\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=0.623{-}0.974$  ,  $P=$  0.028; Dominance model:   $\mathrm{OR}=0.767$  ,  $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}=0.619–0.952$  ,  $P=0.016$  ; Log-additive model:   $\mathrm{{OR}=0.800,\,95\%\ C I=0.668-}$  0.959,  $P=0.016$  ) ( Table 3  and  Figure 1A ). However, rs1053605 and rs243849 in  MMP2  in Chinese Shaanxi population did not show an evident association with IS susceptibility in the overall analysis.  

# Stratiﬁed analysis  

In order to exclude the interference of environmental factors on the reliability of the results, we stratiﬁed the recruited samples by gender, age, smoking and drinking ( Tables 4 ,  5 and  Supplementary Table 2 ), with the results of signiﬁcant correlation shown in  Figure 1B.  Statistical analysis results revealed that rs243849 in  MMP2  was sign i cant ly associated with the occurrence and development of IS risk under multiple genetic models of drinkers (Allele model:  $\mathrm{{OR}=1.486}$  ,   $95\%$   CI  $=1.128–1.957$  ,    $P=0.005$  ; Co-dominant model:   $\mathrm{{OR}=1.521}$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=1.079{-}2.143$  ,  $P=0.017$  ; Dominance model:  $\mathrm{OR}=$  1.604,   $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=1.151–2.236$  ,    $P=0.005$  ; Log-additive model:

  $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,1.558}$  ,   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}\,=\,1.168{-}2.079$  ,    $P\,=\,0.003$  ). Stratiﬁed results suggested that rs14070 in  MMP2  apparently reduced susceptibility to IS in additive model across females (  $(\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,0.716$  ,  $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=0.525–0.976,$  ,  $P=0.035$  ), participants with aged  ${>}55$  (  $\mathrm{{OR}=0.743}$  ,  $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=0.554–0.998$  ,  $\mathrm{P}=0.049]$  ), smoker (OR

  $=0.758$  ,  $95\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=0.579{-}0.994$  4,  $P=0.045j$  ) and drinker   $(\mathrm{OR}=$  0.749,  $95\%$   $5\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=0.573{-}0.979$  ,  $P=0.034$  ). In addition, the allelic model of rs14070 in  MMP2  evidently reduced the risk of IS in the female population   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.727,\,95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=0.541{-}0.976,\,\mathrm{P}=$  0.037) and the co-dominant model among smoking participants

  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.454$  ,  $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=0.208–0.991$  ,    $P=0.047$  ). Rs1053605 in MMP2  was not associated with the risk of IS in multiple genetic models with diﬀerent strat i cations.  

# Haplotype and MDR analysis  

The linkage d is equilibrium (LD) results demonstrated that the three candidate SNPs (rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070)

of  MMP2  formed an LD block  (Figure 2A),  which illustrated that there was a strong linkage relationship among the SNPs of MMP2 . Additionally, the results of MDR analysis claimed that the single-locus model (rs14070), the two-loci model (rs243849 and rs14070) and the three-loci model (rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070) all had high test accuracy, high cross-validation

consistency (CVC) and    $\textit{P}~<~0.05$  , as depicted in  Table 6 , Figures 2B,C . In conclusion, the three candidate SNPs in  MMP2 have strong genetic associations, and the interaction of gene polymorphisms may play an essential role in the genetic susceptibility of IS.  

# MMP2  related functions  

To further explore the potential function of  MMP2 in regulating IS, protein-protein interaction ﬁgure and KEGG enrichment were constructed. It was indicated that  MMP2  can regulate the metal lo protein as e inhibitor family ( TIMP1 , TIMP2 and TIMP3 ) and ang io genesisrelated targets such as  VEGFA  and  TGF $\cdot\beta$  (Figure 3A). Pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that MMP2 and its related proteins mainly regulate relaxin signaling pathway involved in ang io genesis, in amma tion and vascular endo the li al function  (Figures 3B,C).  In brief,  MMP2  mainly regulated ang io genesis and in amma tion and plays a pivotal role in the occurrence, development and recovery of IS.  

# Discussion  

IS is the leading cause of disability and death worldwide (10) , a complex neurological disorder involving multiple factors including genetics and environment  (4) . The International Stroke Genetics Consortium suggested that genetic factors may account for up to   $50\%$   of an individual’s risk of stroke  (10) . Previous extensive GWAS analyses have implicated genetic factors as a major contributor to stroke occurrence  (21) . Twentytwo new stroke risk loci were found to be sign i cant ly associated with stroke subtypes and pleiotropic models by GWAS analysis of 520,000 subjects from multiple countries  (22) . Studies have shown that people with high genetic risk have a   $35\%$   higher risk of stroke compared with people with low genetic risk, with a hazard ratio of 1.35 (  $\cdot95\%$   CI: 1.21–1.50,    $P\;<\;0.001$  ) (23) . In many neurological diagnoses, signiﬁcant individual diﬀerences in rehabilitation outcomes may be associated with genetic variation. For example, rs6265   $(\mathrm{{val}^{66}\mathrm{{met})}}$   on brainderived neuro troph ic factor ( BDNF ) sign i cant ly aﬀected neuro plasticity after stroke in Chinese, Iranian, Korean and East Asian populations  (24) . In a nutshell, genetic factors are the main contributors to the occurrence, development and recovery of stroke.  

As one of the major constituent enzymes in the brain  (25) , MMP2  is a crucial target in the  MMPs  family that regulates ECM degradation and blood-brain barrier disruption  (26) . MMP2 was involved in the process of stroke injury in the early stage, and its activity and protein expression were obviously increased at this time  (26) . At the same time, Claudin-5 and occludin were degraded by  MMP2 , the BBB was destroyed and the size of cerebral infarction increased  (27) .  MMP2 can also promote endogenous repair, especially ang io genesis, cerebral blood ﬂow reconstruction and repair of brain tissue damage in the recovery stage after stroke  (25) . In general,

MMP2  is an important regulatory indicator of stroke occurrence and recovery.  

The regulatory role of  MMP2  may be related to the regulation of its genetic variation. Li et al.  (13)  illustrated that compared with the normal control group, the frequency of CC genotype and C allele of  MMP2  735C/T in the ﬁrst and recurrent IS in the Chinese population were sign i cant ly increased, and the frequency of IS recurrence was more signiﬁcant. Previous studies demonstrated that rs243849 in  MMP2  evidently reduced the risk of IS in Hainan population, while rs1053605 in  MMP2 was not found to be associated with IS susceptibility  (9) . At present, no study has explored the correlation between rs14070 in  MMP2  and IS susceptibility, only found that rs14070 was positively correlated with the incidence of hypertension caused by urinary cadmium  (20) . In our study, the results showed that rs1053605 was not sign i cant ly associated with IS susceptibility in Chinese Shaanxi population, which was consistent with the results reported in the literature. This study indicated that rs243849 in  MMP2  obviously increase the risk of IS in drinkers under multiple genetic models, however, rs243849 in  MMP2  in the literature evidently reduced the risk of IS in Hainan population. Apart from drinking, the reasons for this diﬀerence may be related to environmental, climatic and dietary factors in the northern and southern Chinese populations. Furthermore, this study was the ﬁrst to conﬁrm that rs14070 in  MMP2  apparently reduced the risk of IS in Chinese Shaanxi population under multiple genetic models. In brief, the polymorphism diﬀerences of  MMP2  were sign i cant ly associated with the risk of IS in Chinese Shaanxi populations, and the key role of  MMP2  may depend on polymorphism diﬀerences.  

Genetic susceptibility to IS may be associated with race, age, smoking, and drinking. A study found that long-term smoking, body mass index (BMI)  ${\geq}30$  , inactivity or unhealthy diet will increase the risk of IS by  $66\%$   (23) . Rs1800795 in  IL-6  in Asian populations was sign i cant ly associated with stroke occurrence, whereas rs1800795 on  IL-6  in Oceania populations was not associated with IS occurrence  (1) . Another study demonstrated that SNPs in  PITX2  sign i cant ly reduced the risk of IS in Chinese Han males  (2) . In addition, SNPs in  HTRA1  were sign i cant ly associated with the risk of IS among Chinese Han smokers  (5) . In our study, analysis results illustrated that rs243849 in  MMP2  was associated with evidently increased IS risk in Chinese drinking population under allelic, co-dominant, dominant and additive genetic models. However, rs14070 in MMP2  can still sign i cant ly reduce IS susceptibility in Chinese Shaanxi population older than 55 years, females, smokers and drinkers. These study suggested that genetic susceptibility to IS is closely related to race, sex, advanced age, smoking and drinking.  

The function of  MMP2  depends on endogenous inhibitors ( TIMP ), ang io genesis factors ( VEGF ,  TGF $\cdot\beta$  ) and in amma tory factors  (28) . The regulation of ECM degradation mainly depends on the balance between MMPs-TIMP  (29) . Imbalance of  MMP - TIMP  can lead to neurological diseases (stroke, Alzheimer’s disease), atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (30) . Notably, the secretion and regulation of  MMP2  lead to BBB damage in the early stage of stroke  (31) . As a major inhibitor of  MMP2  (19) ,  TIMP2  likewise has a dual role  (29) . VEGF  interacting with  MMP2  regulated neo vascular remodeling and neuro protection after stroke injury  (32) . Similarly,  TGF $\beta$   can promote the remodeling of ECM and inhibit the disruption of BBB  (32) . Furthermore,  MMP-2  and  TGF-  $\beta$   can be bidirectional ly regulated, which is beneﬁcial to ang io genesis and reconstruction  (30) . In this study, we demonstrated that  MMP2  mainly regulated  TIMPs  and ang io genesis factors ( VEGF ,  TGF $\cdot\beta$  ). Subsequently, they participated in the Relaxin signaling pathway to regulate ang io genesis, in amma tion and vascular endo the li al function. Collectively,  MMP2  can regulate

in amma tion, ang io genesis, and ECM degradation, which play a crucial role in IS occurrence and recovery.  

Interesting ﬁndings were revealed in this study, which provided a reliable basis to future research on  MMP2  regulation of IS. However, potential limitations of our study deserve consideration. In this study, only 3 SNPs in  MMP2  were explored, and we will continue to explore the association of other SNPs in  MMP2 , MMPs and gene interactions with IS

susceptibility in the future  (16) . Additionally, the current study was limited to a single ethnic group, other ethnic groups should be validated in the future  (13, 17) . Finally, in order to further determine the potential impact of  MMP2  genetic variation on the risk of IS, cell and animal models will be required to verify its regulatory mechanism in diﬀerent stages of IS  (2) .  

# Conclusion  

In general, this study explored the association of rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070 in  MMP2  with the risk of IS in Chinese Shaanxi population. Stratiﬁed analysis indicated that rs243849 in  MMP2  obviously increased the risk of IS among drinking population, while rs14070 in  MMP2  evidently reduced IS susceptibility in females, participants with older than 55, smokers, and drinkers. This study illustrated that genetic variation of  MMP2  played an essential role in the occurrence and recovery of IS, which provided support for the early diagnosis and treatment of IS.
