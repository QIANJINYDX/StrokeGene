# Abstract  

# Background  

Cytochrome P450 system is implicated in vascular path o logie s, including stroke. Besides its role as a drug metabolize r, it also plays an important role in the metabolism of several endogenous substances like fatty acids, arachidonic acid, etc., which have pro-inflammatory effects. On the other hand, leptin and a dip one ct in are two of the most common adipose tissue-derived cytokines (adipokines), which are proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory in nature, respectively. Both of them are implicated in the pathogen es is of stroke.  

# Methods  

We prospectively recruited ischemic stroke patients (within three months of occurrence of an attack of stroke). The occurrence of composite outcome (recurrence of transient ischemic attack/ischemic stroke or death) was evaluated for association with genetic variants of CYP2C19 (allele  $^{*}2$  ,  $^{*}17$  ,  $^{*}3,$  , and  $^{*}4$  , i.e., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 1/2/3/4, identified using TaqMan assays and DNA sequencing). A dip one ct in and leptin levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immuno s or bent assay. Comparisons were made between stroke vs. control patients and between CYP2C19 intermediate metabolize r (IM)/poor metabolize r

 (PM) vs. extensive metabolize r (EM)/ultra metabolize r (UM) (PM:  $^{*}2/^{*}2$  ; IM:  $^{*}1/^{*}2$   vs. EM:  $^{*}1/^{*}1$  ; UM:

  $^{\ast}1/^{\ast}17.$  ).  $\mathrm{P}<0.05$   was taken as the threshold for statistical significance.  

# Results  

A total of 204 patients and 101 controls were recruited. With regard to the occurrence of stroke, SNP2 showed a significant positive association. Haplotypes (SNP1/SNP2) AC (  $[\mathrm{OR}=1.75$   (1.08-2.83),  $\mathsf{p}=0.024)$   and GT (  $\mathrm{OR}=5.35$   (1.53-7.22),  $\mathsf{p}=0.0026$  ) were strongly associated with the occurrence of ischemic stroke even after adjustment for age and sex (global haplotype association p-value: 0.0062). Haplotype phenotype gender interaction was evident. Among stroke patients, with regard to composite outcome, only SNP1 showed a positive association. The AC haplotype was significantly associated with the occurrence of composite outcome   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.27$   (1.17-4.41),  ${\tt p}=0.016$  ). Among stroke patients, a significant positive association was seen between death and SNP1 (  $[\mathrm{OR}=2.35$   (1.13-4.90),  $\mathsf{p}=0.021$  ) and AC haplotype   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.73$  (1.20-6.22),  $\mathsf{p}=0.018,$  ). However, none of the SNPs or haplotypes showed any association with recurrence.  

Significant higher leptin and lower a dip one ct in levels were observed among stroke patients compared to controls. Leptin levels were higher in IM/PM group. IM/PM phenotypes showed a higher incidence of occurrence of composite outcome (hazard ratio  $=2.07$   (0.96-4.47),  $\mathsf{p}=0.056)$  ).  

# Conclusion  

CYP2C19 polymorphisms may play a significant role in the pathogen es is of stroke. Leptin could serve as a prominent biomarker of atherosclerosis and inflammation in the early post-stroke period; however, further study is warranted with a larger sample size.

# Introduction  

The incidence of stroke is increasing globally. Expected global deaths due to stroke are expected to increase to over 7.8 million by 2030 and produce an immense health burden in the absence of a substantial global public health response  [1] . In India, stroke is among the leading causes of disability and death  [2] . About  $80\%$  of strokes are ischemic in nature  [3] .  

Atherosclerosis and thrombosis are two main processes involved in the pathogen es is of ischemic strokes. Inflammation is one of the major underlying mechanisms for the occurrence of atherosclerosis  [3] . Ad ipo cytokines, va so regulatory molecules, and various growth factors are enormously involved in the intricate process of atherosclerosis  [4,5] . Leptin and a dip one ct in are the most common adipose tissuederived cytokines that have shown an association with the occurrence of atherosclerosis and stroke, respectively  [6] .  

The cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is a large group of enzymes expressed predominantly in the liver and majorly responsible for drug metabolism. Besides metabolizing, some enzymes of CYP are also involved in the modulation of vascular flow and metabolism of several endogenous substances, such as fatty acids and cholesterol, including arachidonic acid, which has pro-inflammatory effects  [7-9] . CYP2C9/19 polymorphism is reported to be associated with atherosclerosis. Also, CYP2C19 has a defined role in cholesterol elimination as well as the elimination of steroid hormones and is being increasingly considered a mediator of inflammation-mediated vascular events. Taking this into consideration, we hypothesized that the common genetic variants of CYP2C19 could affect the dys regulation of ad ipo cytokine levels and may have a possible role in the occurrence and recurrence of stroke in the Indian population.  

# Materials And Methods  

# Primary objectives  

The primary objectives were as follows: (1) to study the dys regulation of ad ipo cytokines (leptin and total a dip one ct in) in ischemic stroke patients; (2) to study the association between polymorphisms in CYP2C19 system and occurrence of stroke; (3) to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in CYP2C19 system and occurrence of the composite outcome of recurrence of transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke and death.  

# Secondary outcomes  

The secondary objectives were as follows: (1) to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 system and the occurrence of the final outcome (live vs. death); (2) to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 system and recurrence of TIA/ischemic stroke among live patients;

 (3) to study the impact of CYP2C19 polymorphisms (allele  $^{*}2$   (rs424485), allele   $^{*}3$   (rs4986893), allele  $^{*}4$  (rs28399504), and allele  $^{*}17$   (rs12248560)) on the production of ad ipo cytokines production; (4) to study the effect of ad ipo cytokines (leptin and total a dip one ct in) levels on clinical outcome (occurrence of stroke);

 (5) to study the level of ad ipo cytokines (leptin and total a dip one ct in) among poor metabolize r

 (PM)/intermediate metabolize r (IM) and extensive metabolize r (EM)/ultra metabolize r (UM).  

# Definition of composite clinical outcome  

In our study, the composite outcome was defined as the composite of the occurrence of any of the following events: death, recurrent TIAs, or ischemic events.  

# Subject selection  

A prospective study was carried out on ischemic stroke/TIA patients who presented within three months of an attack. The patients were recruited from indoor/outdoor patient services of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.  

# Study population  

Regarding the inclusion of cases, we included patients  $\geqslant18$   years of age of either gender presenting with TIA or ischemic stroke occurring within the last three months (of either anterior or posterior circulation, including lacunars strokes, confirmed by an imaging modality, CT scan, or MRI) and who were on secondary prophylaxis for stroke with either clop i dog rel or clop i dog rel and aspirin. We excluded patients with intra cranial hemorrhagic stroke, card i oem boli c stroke, and non-at hero sclerotic stroke, e.g., dissection and vasculitis. Patients with chronic disease, cancer, collagen vascular disease, HIV, congestive cardiac failure, pregnancy, and contrast allergy were also excluded.  

# Control group  

Age and sex-matched unrelated controls without any history of stroke and who were not taking any antiinflammatory drug at least for 14 days were enrolled.  

# Follow up  

The TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria  [10]  were used to classify the stroke subtypes. They were followed up telephonic ally and patients were queried for any recurrence of ischemic stroke, TIAs, and death due to vascular causes. The median follow-up time was 34 months (IQR: 19-46).  

# Clinical data collection  

All data collected were assessed by two neurologists separately in a blinded manner. The standard criteria followed for the assessment of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and obesity have been mentioned in a previous report by Gairolla et al.  [11] .  

# Sample collection and genotyping  

Five milliliters of whole blood was collected from each patient in ethylene dia mine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) and sodium (Na)-heparin vials. DNA extraction was performed in an EDTA sample using PureLink Genomic DNA Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Genetic variants of CYP2C19 (allele  $^{*}2$   (rs424485), allele  $^{*}3$   (rs4986893), allele  $^{*}4$   (rs28399504), and allele  $^{*}17$   (rs12248560)) were genotyped using TaqMan-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assays on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine (Applied Biosystems Step One Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) as per manufacturer guidelines (Supplementary Table A1). Five microliter s of TaqMan universal PCR master and DNA range from 5 to  $25\,\mathrm{ng}$  were added to the final volume of  $10\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   (Supplementary Table A2). PCR data were analyzed using StepOne software version 2.2.2. DNA sequencing for  $\mathrm{CMP2C19^{*}3}$   (ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer, SciGenom Labs, Kochi, India) was performed in randomly selected samples.  

# Ad ipo cytokine measurement (leptin and total a dip one ct in)  

Estimation of ad ipo cytokines levels (leptin (Cat.  $\#$   DLP00) and total a dip one ct in (Cat. # DRP 300)) was carried out in plasma sample pull out from sodium (Na)-heparin blood using quantitative enzyme-linked immuno s or bent immuno as say technique purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Plasma levels of leptin and total a dip one ct in   $\mathrm{(n=204)}$  ) were compared between patients   $\mathrm{(n=204)}$  ) and healthy controls (  $\mathrm{{\acute{n}}=}$  50). A linearity curve was prepared for the calculation of plasma concentration using a linear equation model. Sensitivity for leptin and total a dip one ct in were less than  $7.8\;\mathrm{{pg/ml}}$   and  $0.246\,\mathrm{ng}/\mathrm{ml}$  , respectively. Intra-assay variation (coefficient of variation) for leptin   $(1\,\mathrm{mg/ml})$  ) and total a dip one ct in   $(125\,\mathrm{ng}/\mathrm{m})$  ) was  $8.6\%$   and  $14.1\%$  , respectively.  

# Ethical permission  

Informed consent was signed by all recruited patients after ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC), Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. The IEC approved the study (NK/1216//Ph.D/20259, INT/IEC/2015/706).  

# Sample size  

The sample size was calculated on the basis of the genetic frequency of CYP2C19 allele  $^{*}2$   in the Indian population keeping  $29\%$   as frequency and confidence limits at  $7\%$  . A minimum sample size of 162   $(95\%$   CI) patients is required to accomplish the study objectives. While calculating the sample size, we followed the guideline of the Department of Biotechnology, India. We recruited 101 healthy controls and 204 stroke patients for the study.  

# Statistical analysis  

Categorical variables are expressed as percentages   $(\%)$   and continuous variables, which are not normally distributed, are described in the median with interquartile range (IQR), and a non-parametric test (MannWhitney test) was done to determine the significance. Any deviation of allelic and genotype distribution from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) proportions was tested using  $\chi2$   or Fisher's exact test. Cox regression and survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to calculate the hazard ratio and cumulative event-free survival. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was done in variables that were statistically significant in univariate analysis. For base numbering and allele definitions of CYP2C, we followed the nomenclature of the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Committee (www.cypalleles.ki.se)  [12] . The genotype-phenotype associations were evaluated using both univariate and multivariate approaches using different models for genetic association studies (co-dominant, dominant, recessive, over-dominant, and log additive models). In the case of two SNPs or more, linkage d is equilibrium and haplotype association were evaluated with the clinical outcomes.  

# Poor/intermediate metabolize rs and extensive/ultra metabolize rs with CYP2C19 function description  

Based on CYP2C19 genotypes (allele  $^{*}2$   (rs424485), allele  $^{*}3$   (rs4986893), allele  $^{*}4$   (rs28399504), and allele  $^{\ast}17$   (rs12248560)), patients were categorized into two groups as poor/intermediate metabolize rs (PM:  $^{*}2/^{*}2$  ;  

IM:  $^{*}1/{^{*}2}$  ) and extensive/ultra metabolize rs (EM:  $^{\ast}1/{}^{\ast}1$  ; UM:  $^{*}1/{}^{*}17_{c}$  )  [12] . Heterozygotes with one mutated allele and other wild types of allele   $(^{\ast}1/^{\ast}2)$  ) are intermediate metabolize rs and homozygous mutated states  $(^{\ast}2/^{\ast}2)$  /heterozygous mutated (e.g.,  $^{*}2/^{*}3.$  ) are poor metabolize rs  [12] .  

The wild-type   $\mathrm{CMP2C19^{*}1}$   allele is associated with functional CYP2C19-mediated metabolism. The most common CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) allele is  $^{*}2$   (  $\mathrm{c.681G{>}A}$  ; rs4244285). Other CYP2C19 variant alleles with reduced or absent enzymatic activity have been identified (e.g.,  $^{*}3–^{*}8)$    [12] . The CYP2C19 LOF alleles are inherited as an autosomal co-dominant trait. The lowest activity is seen in LOF allele homozygotes  $(^{\ast}3/^{\ast}3)$   or compound heterozygotes  $(^{\ast}3/^{\ast}3)$  ), followed by heterozygotes  $(^{*}1/^{*}2$   or  $^{*}1/^{*}3$  ) compared to normal wild type  $(^{\ast}1/^{\ast}1)$  . In this regard, CY2C19 genotypes are categorized as extensive metabolize rs (EMs:  $^{*}1/^{*}1\bigstar$  ), intermediate metabolize rs (e.g., IMs   $^{*}1/^{**}2$   and  $^{*}1/^{*}3,$  ), or poor metabolize rs (PMs:  $^{*}2/^{*}2$   and  $^{*}2/^{*}3$  ). By contrast, the common  $\mathrm{Cyr2C19^{*}17}$   allele (  $_{\mathrm{c.-}806\mathrm{C>T}}$  ; rs12248560) results in increased activity as a consequence of enhanced transcription. However,   $^{*}2/^{*}17$   compound heterozygotes should be classified as IMs (significant linkage d is equilibrium exists between  $^{*}2$   and  $^{*}17$   alleles)  [12] .  

# Results  

# Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients  

A total of 204 patients with ischemic stroke/TIAs were enrolled from May 2013 to September 2018. The mean age (SD) of stroke patients was  $57\pm13$   years and 156  $(76.5\%)$  ) patients were male. Of the patients, 184  $(90.2\%)$   had an ischemic stroke. A total of 133   $(65.2\%)$  ) patients had a history of hypertension and 60   $(29.4\%)$  were smokers. Of the patients, 66   $(52.4\%)$   had diabetes mellitus and 28   $(13.7\%)$   had obesity. A family history of stroke was present in  $12.7\%$   of patients (Table  1 ). All the patients belonged to North India and the majority were primarily from Chandigarh (union territory)  $(41.1\%)$   and the state of Punjab  $(27.5\%)$  .

Stroke vs. No Stroke (Control): Genetic Association  

Regarding CYP genotypes as predictors for the occurrence of stroke, we used different genetic models for the association studies. The models were decided on the basis of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayes information criterion (BIC) values of that respective model. No significant association was observed between the occurrence of stroke and SNP1.  

In the case of SNP2, the lowest AIC value was 385.9 and the lowest BIC value was 401.2. The models performing within two units of this lowest AIC and BIC value were recessive and the log additive model. Interestingly, SNP2 showed a significant positive association with the occurrence of stroke in both of these two models. Data are presented in Table  5 .

IM: intermediate metabolize r; PM: poor metabolize r; EM: extensive metabolize r; UM: ultra metabolize r. Effect of Genetic Variants and Ad ipo cytokines (Leptin and Total A dip one ct in) Levels on Clinical Outcome  

A follow-up was carried out with 174   $(85.2\%)$   patients who were queried for any recurrence of ischemic stroke, TIAs, and death due to vascular causes. Patients unable to visit the hospital were followed up telephonic ally. The endpoint was TIA/stroke/any vascular death. A total of 33   $(19\%)$   patients reached the composite endpoint of death, recurrent TIAs, and ischemic events. The median follow-up time was 34 months (IQR: 19-46). The percentage of composite outcome (TIA/stroke/any vascular death) was higher in IM/PM   $(72.7\%)$   than in EM/UM  $(27.3\%)$  . A trend of association was reported between the occurrence of composite vascular events and IM/PM phenotypes (24 vs. nine events,  $\mathrm{HR}=2.07$     $95\%$     $\mathrm{{CI}}=0.96$  -4.47),  ${\mathfrak{p}}=$  0.056) (Figure  4 ).

# Discussion  

In our study, we have evaluated the effect of polymorphisms of CYP2C19 (allele  $^{*}2$   (rs424485), allele  $^{*}3$  (rs4986893), allele   $^{*}4$   (rs28399504), and allele  $^{*}17$   (rs12248560)) on the occurrence of stroke, occurrence of the composite endpoint (TIA/ischemic stroke/vascular death), death vs. live, and recurrence of stroke/TIA. From the knowledge of the literature, these genotypes were categorized into poor/intermediate metabolize rs and extensive/ultra metabolize rs  [12] . A dip one ct in and leptin levels were evaluated among patients with EM/UM and PM/IM genotypes.  

# Stroke vs. no stroke (control)  

In our study, no significant association was observed between the occurrence of stroke and SNP1. SNP2 showed a significant positive association with the occurrence of stroke in both of these two models (recessive and the log additive model). No significant covariate effect was seen with sex when adjusted by age. The AC   $[\mathrm{OR}=1.75$   (1.08-2.83),  $\mathsf{p}=0.024)$  ) and GT haplotypes   $(\mathrm{OR}=3.33$   (1.53-7.22),  $\mathsf{p}=0.0026\$  ) were found to be strongly associated with the occurrence of stroke (global haplotype association p-value: 0.0062). Among females, the haplotype phenotype interaction was not observed; however, haplotype phenotype interaction was evident among males, and compared to the GC haplotype, AC and GT haplotypes were significantly associated with the occurrence of stroke (after adjusting for age). In previous literature also, Cyp2C19 polymorphism (G681A) was found to be associated with both occurrence and recurrence of cerebral ischemic stroke  [13] . Another study found an association between CYP1A1 activity and the occurrence of stroke  [14] . Findings from these studies support our findings that CYP450 polymorphisms can be directly associated with stroke. CYP450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many endogenous molecules, which may explain the findings.  

# Stroke patients: composite outcome  

Among stroke patients, while evaluating the association between SNP1 and the occurrence of the composite outcome, the best-performing models in terms of lowest AIC and BIC score were the dominant model (2.31 (0.99-5.35),  $\mathsf{p}=0.045,$  ) and log-additive model (1.82 (1.02-3.27),  $\mathsf{p}=0.042.$  ). Interestingly, both these models showed a positive association between SNP1 and the occurrence of composite outcomes. However, no association was seen between SNP2 and the occurrence of composite outcomes. While evaluating the different haplotypes of SNP1 and SNP2 and their association with the occurrence of the composite outcome, the AC haplotype was significantly associated with the occurrence of the primary outcome   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.27$   (1.17- 4.41),  ${\tt p}=0.016$  , global haplotype association p-value: 0.044). While evaluating the interaction between haplotypes, composite outcome, and impact of important covariates (sex), no significant covariate effect was observed after adjusting for age.  

# All stroke patients: alive vs. dead  

A significant positive association was seen between the occurrence of the final outcome (death) and SNP1 (  $[\mathrm{OR}=2.35$   (1.13-4.90),  $\mathsf{p}=0.021$  ). However, no association was seen between the occurrence of the final outcome (death) and SNP2 (  $\mathrm{OR}=0.53$   (0.20-1.45),  ${\tt p}=0.19$  ).  

Among different haplotypes, the AC haplotype was found to be associated with death (OR 2.73 (1.20-6.22), p  $=0.018$  , global haplotype association p-value: 0.039). No significant interaction was seen between the occurrence of the final outcome, haplotype, and sex (after adjustment by age).  

# All live stroke patients: recurrence vs. no recurrence  

No association was seen with recurrence and SNP1   $\mathrm{{CR}}=0.38$   (0.10-1.40), 0.12) and SNP2   $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.83$   (0.44- 1.59),  $\mathsf{p}=0.58,$  ). Among live stroke patients, no significant association was seen between any of the haplotypes and recurrence. No significant covariate effect of age was observed after adjustment for age.  

# A dip one ct in and leptin levels and occurrence of stroke and metabolic phenotype  

Significant higher levels of leptin   $\mathrm{(ng/ml)}$   and lower levels of total a dip one ct in  $(\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{mol})$  ) were observed between patients and controls. The levels of leptin and a dip one ct in levels were higher in females compared to males. After comparing ad ipo cytokines levels between IM/PM and EM/UM groups, leptin levels were found to be increased in IM/PM with respect to EM/UM. The percentage of composite outcome (TIA/stroke/any vascular death) was higher in IM/PM  $(72.7\%)$  ) than in EM/UM   $(27.3\%)$  ). A trend of association was seen between the occurrence of composite vascular events and IM/PM phenotypes (24 vs. nine events,  $\mathrm{HR}=2.07$   (  $95\%\;\mathrm{CI}=0.96–4.47)$  ),  $\mathsf{p}=0.056$  ). A subsequent study with a higher sample will be helpful in further delineating the effect size.  

Up to now, several studies showed the role of CYP2C enzymes on the metabolism of xenobiotic agents and drugs. However, to the best of our knowledge, an association between the CYP2C genetic system and dys regulation of ad ipo cytokine in relation to ischemic stroke has not been studied earlier. Among all devastating neurological diseases, stroke is the leading one, which causes death or disability in developing countries, including India  [15] . Stroke pathology is complex and various cytokines are formed when the cascade of two mechanisms, namely, inflammation and atherosclerosis, is in progress  [6,16,17] . Leptin and a dip one ct in are adipose-derived cytokines that have manifold effects on human biology. Functionally, leptin is pleiotropic in nature; it shows pro-a the rogen ic effects and promotes thrombosis both in vivo and in vitro conditions through the presence of its receptor on platelet surfaces  [18] . A dip one ct in exhibited antia the rogen ic and anti-thrombotic properties  [19] . Dys regulation of these two ad ipo cytokines is associated with all types of strokes and the same has been reported in the current study while comparing the ad ipo cytokines levels between ischemic attack patients and healthy controls. CYP genes are highly polymorphic and previous literature suggests that increased serum (or plasma) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor $\cdot\upalpha$  ) are influenced by the expression of the CYP system [20,21] . A study by Akasaka et al. proved that CYP2C19 variants affect micro vascular dysfunction and CYP2C19 poor metabolize rs secrete the increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) that further suggests CYP system involvement in inflammation  [22] . In the current study, the prevalence of CYP2C19 IM/PM phenotypes is reported at a frequency of  $57.8\%$  , which is higher than previous reports from Asia  [12] . In previous reports,  $\mathrm{CMP2C19^{*}2}$   is also determined as a risk factor gene associated with recurrent vascular events in cardiovascular and cerebro vascular diseases; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear  [13,23] . The current study also found CYP2C19 as a candidate gene that increased the risk of vascular events in ischemic stroke patients.  

The current study had a few limitations. Firstly, a single-time assessment of leptin and a dip one ct in levels was done, which is insufficient to understand changes in the dynamics of inflammation and thrombosis over the follow-up period. Moreover, due to inadequate sample size, the involvement of the CYP enzyme system in ad ipo cytokines production is inconclusive.  

# Conclusions  

With regard to the occurrence of stroke, SNP2 showed a significant positive association. Haplotypes (allele  ${}^{\ast}2/{}^{\ast}17,$  , i.e., SNP1/SNP2) AC   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.75$   (1.08-2.83),  $\mathsf{p}=0.024)$  ) and GT   $(\mathrm{OR}=5.53$   (1.53-7.22),  $\mathsf{p}=0.0026)$  ) were strongly associated with the occurrence of stroke even after adjustment for age and sex (global haplotype association p-value: 0.0062). Haplotype phenotype gender interaction was evident. Among stroke patients, with regard to composite outcome, only SNP1 showed a positive association. The AC haplotype was significantly associated with the occurrence of composite outcome   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.27$   (1.17-4.41),  ${\tt p}=0.016)$  ). Among stroke patients, a significant positive association was seen between death and SNP1   $[\mathrm{OR}=2.35$   (1.13-4.90), p  $=0.021$  ) and AC haplotype   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.73$   (1.20-6.22),  $\mathsf{p}=0.018)$  ). However, none of the SNPs or haplotypes showed any association with recurrence. Significantly higher leptin and lower a dip one ct in levels were observed among stroke patients compared to controls. Leptin levels were found to be increased in IM/PM phenotypes. IM/PM phenotypes showed a higher incidence of occurrence of composite vascular events.  

To conclude, CYP2C19 polymorphisms may play a significant role in the pathogen es is of stroke. Leptin could serve as a prominent biomarker of atherosclerosis and inflammation in the early post-stroke period; however, further study is warranted with a larger sample size. Up regulation and down regulation of leptin and a dip one ct in in ischemic stroke could suggest their importance as future p harm a co logical targets of atherosclerosis and inflammation; however, this dys regulation due to enzymatic action of CYP2C19 phenotypes needs to be explored further in a large prospective study on ischemic stroke.
