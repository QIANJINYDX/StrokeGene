Abstract.  Previous studies identified that ph os ph o dies­ terase 4D ( PDE4D ) gene polymorphism might be associated  with cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic  stroke in human populations. However, as yet, no meta‑anal­ ysis has revealed any detailed association. We retrospectively  reviewed studies regarding the relationship of  PDE4D  gene  polymorphism with ischemic stroke (IS) published during  the period January 2003 to September 2012. According to  the inclusion criteria, 9 of 105 initial studies were included  in the subsequent analysis. The PubMed, Embase and CNKI  of China were searched to identify the relevant studies. A  total of 186 young patients with IS were included for the  meta‑analysis and 232 matched control subjects were enrolled  and results were presented. The association of  PDE4D  gene  polymorphism with IS in various populations was examined.  The results suggested that single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP), SNP 83 in  PDE4D  gene was significantly related  with susceptibility to IS. The meta‑analysis also showed that   $P D E4D$   gene was associated with an enhanced risk of IS.  The meta‑analysis suggested that PDE4D SNP 87 constitutes  an independent risk factor for IS development. To the best of  our knowledge, the present meta‑analysis reveals a number of  possible associations between  PDE4D  gene polymorphism  and IS.  

# Introduction  

Ph os ph odi est erase  4D ( PDE4D ) gene polymorphism is  associated with cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke (IS),  and hemorrhagic stroke in human populations worldwide (1).  Variants of the  PDE4D  gene are associated with stroke, espe­ cially with the combination of card i oem boli c and carotid stroke  identified in the population of Iceland (2). In the year 2002, the  researchers in Iceland studied the gene in the DeCode study  and identified a locus that was associated with stroke on 5q12  using a genome‑wide association study (3). The authors of that  study found that  PDE4D  gene within their region of interest  was associated with stroke, especially with car dio geni c and  carotid stroke. The meta analysis of molecular and epidemio­ logical studies of PDE, PDE‑gene polymorphisms and cerebral  infarction risks or s usc ep tibi li ties in China along with other  populations worldwide have been studied and described (4). Nevertheless, whether patients with the  PDE4D  gene are  susceptible to stroke remains to be determined.  

The  PDE4D  gene variation and cerebral infarction or IS  risks were also found in a Chinese population. A case‑control  study of a Chinese population comprising 639 stroke patients,  including 253 with cerebral thrombosis, 171 with lacunar  infarction, 215 with intra cerebral hemorrhage, and 887 healthy  controls, was conducted (5). Single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs), rs966221, rs456009 and rs2910829 in PDE4D were  selected and based on the significant association with stroke  as previously reported in a Western population (6). These were  genotyped using polymerase chain reaction‑restriction frag­ ment length polymorphism (PCR‑RFLP), and were confirmed  by DNA sequencing. The results showed only SNP  83  (rs966221) was associated with stroke. The allele C of rs966221  was a risk allele, which increased the risk for a the roth rom bot ic  strokes [odds ratio   $(\mathrm{OR}){=}1.51$  ,   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI):  1.09‑2.10] and was independent of conventional risk factors.  The haplotype analysis revealed that the haplotype G‑C‑C  was associated with increased risk for a the roth rom bot ic stroke 

  $(\mathrm{OR}{=}1.80$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.300‑2.491). The results verified that 

  ${\mathrm{SNR}}\;83$   of PDE4D was a genetic risk factor for the athero­ thrombotic strokes in a Chinese population.  

The human  PDE4D  gene spans  $1.5\,\mathrm{Mb}$   regions on chromo­ some 5q12 and contains 24 exons and 9 splice variants. The  PDE4D is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cyclic adenosine  monophosphate (cAMP)‑specific key signal transduction  molecule present in many tissues and cell types. Previous find­ ings showed that the  PDE4D  gene was a susceptibility gene for  IS primarily in elderly populations. However, to the best of our  knowledge, few studies have shown the role of  PDE4D  gene  polymorphisms in a young cohort in a Chinese population.  Genetic variants of  PDE4D  gene have been found showing the  association with an enhanced risk for IS in a young Chinese  population.  

In the present study, we retrospectively reviewed studies  focusing on the relationship of the  PDE4D  gene polymor­ phism with IS published during the period January 2003 to  September 2012.  

# Materials and methods  

A meta‑analysis of molecular and epidemiological studies  of PDE‑gene polymorphisms and cerebral infarction risks  or susceptibility in coastal residents of Wenling, China was  completed. A case‑control study of a Chinese population  comprising 639 stroke patients including 253 with cerebral  thrombosis, 171 with lacunar infarction, 215 with intra cere­ bral hemorrhage, and 887 healthy controls was conducted (5).  

A case‑control study of 205 consecutive Korean patients  with non‑car dio geni c IS, and 103 healthy controls that were  used as stroke‑free without neurological and radiological  problems were included. A meta‑analysis on 6 SNPs of the  PDE4D  gene was used to investigate the association between  this gene and IS by integrating the results of previous studies,  comprising 11,834 cases and 15,233 controls (7-14). Results of  a multi‑centre study involving a large number of samples from  2,599 IS patients and 2,093 control subjects from the south and  west regions of Sweden were identified, to replicate previous  studies regarding IS risk and rs12188950, the allele associated  with stroke (7-14).  

In total, 105 studies from January 2003 to September 2012  were identified by the literature search, of which 9 studies met  the inclusion criteria. A total of 186 young patients with IS were  included in the meta‑analysis as well as 232 matched control  subjects. The results of the meta‑analysis on  PDE4D  gene  polymorphism and IS in various populations were evaluated.  From the 96 excluded studies, 7 studies were duplicate publica­ tions; 36 were reviews, editorials or comments; 32 were from  other ethnic populations; 4 studies did not focus on SNP 83;  and the remaining 17 were studies, which were not related to  the subject of this meta-analysis. A total of 186 young patients,  aged 18‑45 years were studied for the present meta‑analysis  with IS and 232 matched control subjects were enrolled and  results presented. The results of the meta‑analysis studies are  shown from various countries of the world on  PDE4D  gene  polymorphism and IS in various populations. The meta‑analysis  results suggested that SNP, specifically SNP 83, in the  PDE4D gene was significantly associated with susceptibility to IS in  Chinese populations. The results of the meta‑analysis also  showed that PDE4D SNP 87 may not be an independent risk  factor for IS development. However, the meta‑analysis revealed  that  PDE4D  gene was associated with an enhanced risk for IS  in a Chinese population. Results of the meta‑analysis suggest  that PDE4D SNP 87 may or may not be an independent risk  factor for IS development. More current meta‑analysis studies  have identified possible associations between  PDE4D  gene  polymorphism and IS as compared to other studies.  

# Results  

A meta‑analysis of candidate gene polymorphisms and IS  in six study populations was examined in association with  lymph o toxin‑  $\alpha$   ( LTA) in non‑hypertensive patients (15). As  IS is a multi factorial disease with a strong genetic component  including pathways of lipid metabolism, systemic chronic  inflammation, blood coagulation, blood pressure regulation,  and cell adhesion and is involved in stroke path o physiology,  candidate gene polymorphisms in these pathways are consid­ ered genetic risk factors. Wang  et al  (15) genotyped 105 simple  deletions and SNPs from 64 candidate genes in 3,550 patients  and 6,560 controls from six case‑control association studies  performed in United States, Europe and China (15). Genotyping  was carried out using the same immobilized probe typing  system, and meta‑analyses for each study were based on the  summary logistic regressions. The primary analyses were  fixed‑effects meta‑analyses adjusting for age and sex with addi­ tive, dominant and recessive models of inheritance. The results  showed 7 polymorphisms with a nominal additive association,  and none remained statistically significant after adjustment for  multiple comparisons. After stratification for hypertension,  LTA polymorphisms that were in strong linkage disequilib­ rium were significantly associated among non‑hypertensive  individuals: for LTA   $252\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   (additive model),   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.41$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.20‑1.65;  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.00002$  ; for LTA 26Thr>Asn,  $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.19$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.06‑1.34;   $\mathrm{P{=}}0.003$  . LTA   $252\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   remained signifi­ cant after adjustment for multiple testing using either the false  discover rate or by permutation testing. The two SNPs showed  no association in hypertensive subjects (e.g., LTA   $252\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.93$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.84‑1.03;   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.17}$  ). These observations  indicated an important role of LTA‑mediated inflammatory  processes in the pathogen es is of IS.  

The meta‑analysis study was performed on  PDE4D  gene  and risk of non‑car dio geni c IS in a Korean population (16).  Various evidence on different populations suggested the asso­ ciation between  PDE4D  gene and IS. The  PDE4D  genotype  and IS relationship was investigated in a case‑control study  of 205 consecutive Korean patients with non‑car dio geni c  IS (7-14). The 103 healthy controls were considered stroke‑free  without neurological and radiological problems. The geno­ typed PDE4D SNP (SNP 41, rs152312) served as a candidate  marker and was selected for susceptibility to IS, because  SNP 41 showed the most significant association with stroke in  a previous meta‑analysis and a study on Iceland with regard to  PDE4D  gene (7-14). The results showed no significant differ­ ences between the cases and controls in the distribution of  the PDE4D SNP 41 genotypes. The results from the adjusted  conditional logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age,  hypertension, diabetes and smoking status showed no signifi­ cant association between PDE4D SNP 41 genotypes and an  increased risk of non‑car dio geni c IS. It was found that  $P D E4D$  gene was not a major risk factor for non‑car dio geni c IS in a  Korean population, which supported the suggestion that the  causative genetic variants of IS may differ in eastern and  western populations.  

The study of the meta‑analysis was performed for the  association between variation in the  PDE4D  gene and isch­ emic cerebral infarction risk in Asian populations (17). In the  year 2003, it was found in the populations of Iceland, PDE4D  was associated with increased risk of IS (3). These results were  different in Asian populations. A recent meta‑analysis showed  that no genetic variant of PDE4D demonstrated a reproducible  association with IS, when analyzed with respect to Caucasian  populations. In the present study, the Asian populations were  included to determine the association between PDE4D and  ischemic infarction random risk. The case‑control studies were  collected from English and Chinese populations related to the  association between PDE4D and ischemic infarction. For the  Asian populations selection criteria and exclusion criteria were  determined, and a fixed or effects model was used on the basis  of heterogeneity. For each gene variant, the strength of the  genetic association, a pooled OR and   $95\%$   CI were calculated  and publication bias was evaluated. It was found that none  of the Asian subjects were heterozygous for SNP (SNP 45 or  SNP 41). Only 7 studies showed that SNP 83 and SNP 87 had  sufficient data to allow inclusion into the meta‑analyses. The  statistically significant associations with ischemic infarction  in the Asian populations were determined for SNP  $83\,\mathrm{C}$   allele 

  $(\mathrm{OR}{=}1.22$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.03‑1.43) and SNP 83 CC genotype 

  $\mathrm{{OR}}{=}1.42$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.14‑1.77), but not for SNP   $83\ \mathrm{CC}+\mathrm{CT}$  genotypes or SNP 87. The results showed that PDE4D was  associated with ischemic infarction risk in Asian individuals,  and SNP 83 was an important biomarker.  

The meta‑analysis studies of homogeneous subgroups  have shown the association between  PDE4D  gene variants  and IS (18). Results of the Icelandic study showed a significant  positive association between  PDE4D  gene variants and stroke.  However, subsequent studies have shown conflicting results,  possibly due to small sample sizes and the heterogeneity  of these studies (7-14). A meta‑analysis on six SNPs of the  PDE4D  gene was performed to investigate the association  between this gene and IS by integrating the results of previous  studies, comprising 11,834 cases and 15,233 controls (7-14).  The pooled genotypic OR, and OR for each SNP was deter­ mined under three genetic models i.e., dominant, recessive,  and co‑dominant using fixed‑ and random‑effects models with  consideration for heterogeneity and publication bias across  the studies. The results of the SNPs included in this study,  SNP56 (rs702553) showed the most significant association  with IS in a meta‑analysis comprising seven homogenous  studies. The overall OR of the TT genotype compared to the  AA genotype was   $\mathrm{{OR}}{=}1.29$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.03‑1.61;  $\mathrm{P{=}0.022}$  ). For  SNP, SNP 83 (rs966221), a protective effect was observed of  the ancestral allele T only in Asian populations   $(\mathrm{ORTT=}0.79$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.69‑0.90;   $\mathrm{P{=}0.0005)}$  ). The meta‑analysis showed  a significant association of   $P D E4D$   gene variants with the  risk of IS. Further research is important for the evaluation of  possible ethnic‑specific effects in various populations. In the  Chinese population, the results of the meta‑analysis of  PDE4D gene polymorphism which was associated with ischemic and  hemorrhagic stroke (1).  

A large‑sample assessment for the possible association  between IS and rs12188950 in the  PDE4D  gene in a European  population from Sweden was described (19). In previous  studies, there was some ambiguity in findings regarding the  possible associations between IS, IS and SNPs, and SNPs in  the  PDE4D  gene region. The SNP rs12188950 (or SNP 45) was  studied in this regard. A multi‑centre study was performed  involving a large number of sample of 2,599 IS patients and  2,093 control subjects from the south and west regions of  Sweden to replicate previous studies regarding IS risk and  rs12188950 (3). The human participants were enrolled from  Lund Stroke Register (LSR), Malmö Diet and Cancer Study 

 (MDC) and Sahl gren ska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke 

 (SAHLSIS). The subgroups of subjects were also assessed  with hypertension and participants   ${<}55$   years of age, and the  TOAST subgroups large vessel disease, small vessel disease  and CE (3). The univariate ORs and ORs controlling for  hypertension, diabetes, and current smoking were calculated.  A meta‑analysis was performed including 10,500 patients and  10,102 control subjects from 17 publications, including the  present study (7-14). The pooled data from LSR, MDC and  SAHLSIS, were assessed, and there were no associations  between IS and rs12188950 for all the participants   $(\mathrm{OR}{=}0.93$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.83‑1.05). Significant associations were not evident  for hypertensive participants or participants aged   ${<}55$   years,  or when separately evaluating patients the three different  TOAST subgroups. The meta‑analysis showed no significant  overall estimate   $(\mathrm{OR}{=}0.96$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.89‑1.04) with a signifi­ cant heterogeneity for random effect   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.042})$  ) (3). No effect  from rs12188950 on IS was found from either the pooled  multi‑centre data or from the performed meta‑analysis. In the  present study, there was no association between the examined  subgroups and rs12188950 (19). A genetic study is needed  in this respect. As stroke is the second most common cause  of mortality and major cause of disability in the world, the  SNP 83 in the  PDE4D  gene has been suggested as a risk factor  in IS, but direct evidence from genetic association studies are  inconclusive in the Chinese population (20).  

Meta‑analysis of case‑control studies on the relationship  between SNP 83 in  PDE4D  gene and susceptibility to IS in a  Chinese population published domestically and abroad from  January 2003 to September 2012 were performed (7-14). For  the current meta‑analysis, 9 case‑control studies were selected,  and the results showed that a significant association between  SNP 83 and IS was identified under the dominant model   $\mathrm{(OR}{=}1.34\$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.20‑1.49) and recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}{=}1.45$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.19‑1.76) in the Chinese population. In the subgroup  meta‑analysis, SNP 83 and a the roth rom bot ic stroke, rather  than lacunar stroke, showed a significant association under the  dominant model   $\mathrm{{OR}}{=}1.69$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.41‑2.01) and recessive  model   $\mathrm{(OR}{=}1.47\$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.04‑2.06). These results suggested  that SNP 83 in  PDE4D  gene was significantly associated with  susceptibility to IS in Chinese populations. The  PDE4D  gene  was found at the locus on the chromosome 5q12 that encodes  cAMP‑specific 30, 50‑cyclic PDE4D, belonging to a super  family of PDEs (PDE‑4 family). The data for statistical analysis  were analyzed and processed using Review Manager 5.0 and  Stata 10.0. The heterogeneity among studies was examined  with the  $\mathrm{I}^{2}$   statistic and  $I^{2}{>}50\%$  , indicating significant hetero­ geneity between the studies. Based on the test of heterogeneity,  a pooled OR was calculated by using the fixed or random effect  model, along with the   $95\%$   CI to measure the strength of the  genetic association. Publication bias was examined by visual  inspection of the funnel plot, Begg's test and Egger's regres­ sion test (  $\mathrm{{(P{<}0.05}}$   was considered representative of statistically  significant publication bias) (Fig. 1). In total, 105 studies were  identified in the literature search, of which nine studies met  the inclusion criteria. From the 96 excluded studies, 7 studies  were duplicate publications; 36 were reviews, editorials or  comments; 32 were from other ethnic populations; 4 studies  were not involved with SNP 83; and 17 were irrelevant articles.  Meta-analysis results suggested that SNP, specifically SNP 83  in the  PDE4D  gene was significantly associated with suscep­ tibility to IS in the Chinese populations. For SNP 83, the

Figure 1. Publication bias were evaluated by Begg's test and Egger's regression test. P-value of bias equals 0.500, indicating no significant publication bias  among the included studies.  

$\mathrm{I}^{2}$  heterogeneity among the studies, measured by  statistic, was  not significant under the dominant model   $(\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}0)$   and recessive  model   $(\Gamma^{2}{=}31\%$  ). Therefore, the fixed effect model was used for  calculating the pooled OR for the the two models. A signifi­ cant association between SNP 83 and IS was identified under  the dominant model   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.34$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.20‑1.49;  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.00001$  )  and recessive model   $\mathrm{{OR}}{=}1.45$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.19‑1.76;  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.0002$  ),  as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 [adapted from Liu  et al  (20)].  

The sensitivity analysis was also performed with seven  case‑control studies whose genotype frequencies in the  control groups were consistent with the Hardy‑Weinberg  equilibrium. The heterogeneity between studies was not  significant   $\scriptstyle(I^{2}<0.5)$   and the fixed effect model was used for  calculating the pooled OR (20). The sensitivity analysis  revealed that a significant positive association was identified  between SNP 83 and IS under the dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}{=}1.35$  ,   $95\%$    CI: 1.20‑1.51;   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.00001$  ) and the recessive model   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.54$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.26‑1.88;  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.0001$  ). Our meta‑analysis  revealed that the risk of developing IS in carriers with C allele  on SNP 83 was 1.34‑fold higher than that in the individuals  without C allele in the Chinese populations. Additionally, the  risk in individuals with CC genotype was 1.45‑fold higher  than that in individuals without CC genotype.  

Since there are different genetic studies in the popula­ tions of various continents, including North America,  Europe, Asia, and Africa that show variation in genetic  results, the manner in which we explain the associations  between SNP, SNP 83 in PDE,  PDE4D  gene and IS in the  Chinese population remained to be determined. Genetic  experiments of DNA from blood showed variations from  different populations globally.  PDE4D  gene selectively  degraded the second messenger, cAMP in vascular smooth  muscle cells and activated macrophages, and a key signaling  molecule, that mediates cell proliferation and migration  associated with atherosclerosis and plaque stability (7,8).  cAMP is responsible for neuron survival and is a selective  inhibitor of cAMP‑specific PDE‑4, which can promote  the survival of newborn hippo camp al neurons after isch­ emia (9,10). SNP, SNP 83, which is located at the   $5^{\prime}$   end of  PDE4D  gene may affect the transcription, splicing, message  stability, or message transport of one or more isoforms  studied (11). Based on the TOAST classification, IS can be  divided into five subtypes: i) Large‑artery atherosclerosis 

 (LAA), ii) small‑vessel occlusion (SVO), iii) car dio embolism 

 (CE), iv) stroke of other determined etiology, and v) stroke of  undetermined etiology (12). For the Chinese population, five  studies explored the association between SNP 83 and LAA,  and six studies explored the association between SNP 83 and  SVO. Thus, the meta‑analysis was conducted in these two  subgroups. The significant association of SNP 83 was found  with IS only in the LAA subgroup. This can be explained by  the role of the  PDE4D  gene in the process of atherosclerosis.  For the remaining three subtypes of IS, the data were not  sufficient to conduct the meta‑analysis of the LAA subgroup.  Thus the meta‑analysis should be interpreted within the  context of its limitations. A retrospective case‑control design  should be followed for meta‑analysis studies that may be  biased and artifact than prospective studies.

Any variant in or near the SNP 83 in the  PDE4D  gene can  miss the true association. The different linkage d is equilibrium  patterns with the causal variant can lead to variable results in  different populations. It is possible that the potential roles of  SNP 83 in the  PDE4D  gene are diluted or masked by other  gene‑gene or gene‑environment interactions. Publication bias  is an important source of bias in any meta‑analysis study,  which can cause false‑positive results. In meta‑analysis, under  the dominant model, there was no evidence of publication bias  found by visual inspection of the funnel plot, Begg's test or  Egger's regression test. However, under the recessive model, the  publication bias was found by the visual inspection of funnel  plot and Egger's regression test. Thus, the meta‑analysis results  were interpreted with caution for the association of SNP 83  with IS under the recessive model. It has been suggested that  SNP 83 in  PDE4D  gene is associated with developing IS in the  Chinese population. Recently, genetic variants of  PDE4D  gene  have been found for the association with an enhanced risk for  IS in a young Chinese population (13).  

Previous studies showed that the  PDE4D  gene was a  susceptibility gene for the IS primarily in elderly popula­ tions. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies  have shown the role of  PDE4D  gene polymorphisms in a  young cohort in the Chinese population. A total of 186 young  patients, aged 18‑45 years were studied for meta‑analysis  with IS and 232 matched control subjects were included.  The SNPs rs918592 and rs2910829 in the  PDE4D  gene were  genotyped by PCR‑RFLP method. The OR and   $95\%$   CIs  were calculated to test the association between the genetic  factors and IS. The results showed that rs918592A/A geno­ type frequency and A allele frequency, rs2910829 CT/TT  genotype frequency and T allele frequency of young IS group  were significantly higher as compared to the control group   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.05)$  . The frequency of Hap (A‑T) was markedly higher  in the young patients than in the controls   $\mathrm{(OR=}4.047\$  ,  $95\%$   CI:  3.521‑4.652). The Hap (A‑C) and Hap (G‑C) were associated  with a decreased risk of IS   $\mathrm{{OR}{=}0.640}$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.452‑0.906;   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.675$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.466‑0.978, respectively). These findings  suggested that the rs918592 and rs2910829 polymorphisms  and haplotypes of  PDE4D  gene were significantly associated  with the IS in young Chinese population. The recent detailed  study of a meta‑analysis of gene polymorphisms associated  

with the IS in South Asians have been described in a study  from London, UK (14). The burden of stroke is higher in the  South Asian subcontinent with ethnicity of South Asians that  confer a greater risk of IS than European ancestry. The genes  associated with IS in European populations have been studied  but it is not known for Asian populations. A meta‑analysis  study was performed of known genetic polymorphisms  associated with South Asian IS, and compared effect size of  the methylene tetra hydro folate reductase, methylene tetrahy­ drofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T‑stroke association with  effect sizes predicted from homo cyst eine‑stroke association.  Databases of PubMed, Embase and CNKI were searched up  to August 2012 for published case control studies which inves­ tigated genetic polymorphisms associated with IS in South  Asians. The pooled ORs were calculated using random‑effects  model for each gene‑disease association. Twenty-six studies  were identified with 2,529 cases of strokes and 2,881 controls  which investigated 33 independent genetic polymorphisms  in 22  genes. The 10 studies described MTHFR C677T  (108 with TT genotype and 2,018 with CC genotype) ‑homo­ cysteine relationship and 6 studies with 735 stroke cases and  713 controls, described the homo cyst eine‑IS relationship. The  risk association of ORs was calculated for ACE I/D   $\mathrm{{OR}}{=}5.00$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.17‑21.37;   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.03}$  ), PDE4D SNP 83   $\mathrm{{OR}}{=}2.20$  ,   $95\%$    CI: 1.21‑3.99;   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.01}$  ), PDE4D SNP  32 (  $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.57$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.01‑2.45;  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.045}$  ) and IL‑10 G1082A (  $(\mathrm{OR}{=}1.44$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.09‑1.91;  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.01}$  ). The results showed a significant  association between elevated plasma homo cyst eine levels and  MTHFR/677 TT genotypes in healthy South Asians (mean  difference   $(\Delta\mathrm{X}){=}5.18\ \mu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{l}$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 2.03‑8.34;  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.001}$  ).  The genetic etiology of IS in South Asians showed a broad  similarity to the risk conferred in Europeans. However, the  dataset was considerably smaller to suggest the same clinical  considerations for the risk profiling of the study.  

Recently, the identification of genetic contribution to IS  by screening of SNPs in stroke patients using a case control  study design has been described (21). Stroke is the second  most common cause of mortality and disability worldwide  and is a multi factorial disease that is influenced by envi­ ronmental as well as genetic factors. Several meta‑analysis  studies have been reported from different populations and  different ethnic regions worldwide that have shown variable  results with regard to the association of a polio protein E,  MTHFR, endo the li al nitric oxide synthase, factor   $\mathrm{V}$   (F5)  Leiden, cytochrome P450 4F2,  $\upbeta$  ‑fibrinogen and  PDE4D  gene  in stroke (21). There is substantial evidence from European  descent genetic studies that have shown that genetic risk of  stroke varies as per specific subtypes of IS in the population.  The hypothesis was studied that encoding gene polymor­ phisms was associated with stroke and to determine whether  risk varied as per specific subtypes of stroke. A case‑control  study was performed and 600 cases with diagnosis of stroke  and 600 age‑ and gender‑matched controls were recruited (5).  The controls were matched at a 1:1 ratio. The baseline and  demographic data were obtained from a standardized data  collection form. Blood (4 ml) was collected in EDTA‑coated  vials and were used for DNA isolation. The genotyping was  carried out using PCR‑RFLP, and the RFLP results were  reconfirmed by PCR product of each genotype in triplet for  all the selected polymorphism which was used for DNA  sequencing. The data were analyzed using conditional logistic  regression to determine OR associated with the above genes.  The meta‑analysis study of association of the above mentioned  gene polymorphisms with IS in a North Indian popula­ tion was performed (22). The present study was useful in  determining the genetic component of stroke and to observe  whether variations in genetic risks as per different subtypes of  stroke are significant. It is known that  PDE4D  gene is located  on the short arm of chromosome number 5q12 and consists  of 24 exons. The gene expresses nine different functional  protein isoforms through alternative splicing or the use of  differential promoters. It is also known that different PDE4D  variants are expressed in various tissues which include brain,  lungs, kidneys, monocytes, B and T lymphocytes and vascular  smooth muscles (23). PDE4D is the family of enzyme that  breaks the ph os ph odi ester bond of cAMP, degrades these  and maintains the appropriate level and duration of action of  cAMP within the cell. cAMP is a secondary cell signaling  molecule that involves genes in the pre o duct ion of inflam­ matory mediators by several types of inflammatory cells and  art hro sclerosis. PDE4D degrades cAMP, and is responsible  for inhibiting the inflammatory process by blocking the  messaging through cAMP to genes that produce inflamma­ tory proteins. The polymorphism in this gene affects the  catalytic efficiency of PDE4D. The decoding group in 2002  from Iceland found the results of a genome widescreen for  stroke susceptibility genes (11). The 260 PDE4D SNPs were  examined, and 6 were significantly associated with stroke and  observed after multiple comparisons.  

In the year 2006, scientists in Iceland identified the rela­ tionship between  PDE4D  gene and IS (24). To estimate this  association, the results of many researchers are contradic­ tory. A meta‑analysis study was performed to confirm these  results with a large sample size (25). Databases of PubMed,  Embase and CNKI were searched to identify the relevant  studies to January 2013. The OR with   $95\%$   CI were used to  calculate the association between the SNP 83 polymorphism  and IS risk. The 25 publications comprising 8,878 cases and  12,306 controls were included in this meta‑analysis study. The  results showed a significant association between SNP 83 and  IS risk, especially in Asian and Chinese populations, but not  in Caucasians (dominant model:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.87$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.69‑1.11;  recessive model:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.95$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.84‑1.07; allele model:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.95$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.84‑1.08; co‑dominant model 1:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.96$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.85‑1.08; co‑dominant model 2:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.95$  ,   $95\%$   CI:  0.83‑1.09). Among the overall and Chinese populations, the  cumulative meta‑analysis indicated a stable trend of associa­ tion between SNP 83 and IS from the year 2009 to 2012.  

# Discussion  

An association between SNP 83 and IS has been found in  the overall population and in the Asian and Chinese popu­ lations, but not among Caucasian populations. The recent  study of Liang  et al  focused on the association between  PDE4D SNP 87 and IS by evaluating the meta‑analysis of  various populations  (26). The results on the association  between PDE4D SNP 87 and the risk of IS are contentious  and debatable. The new meta‑analysis studies indicated some  possible associations while other studies did not. Based on a  comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and CNKI data­ bases, 18 eligible articles were identified and examined for the  relationship between PDE4D SNP 87 and IS risk in various  populations. The strength of the association was established  using ORs with  $95\%$   CIs. The overall analysis showed that  PDE4D SNP 87 did not affect the risk of IS. The null asso­ ciation persisted in the subgroup analyses by ethnicity and  sample size. The results of the meta‑analysis suggested that  PDE4D SNP 87 may not be an independent risk factor for IS  development. However, additional genetic research is needed  to confirm the association of   $P D E4D$   gene polymorphism  and risk of IS in Chinese population. The meta‑analysis also  showed that the D allele is a modest but independent risk  factor for IS onset (27). Thus, the meta‑analysis is useful  in the study of allelic association for detecting the risks of  candidate genes in polygenic disorders.  

Further studies are needed to confirm the association of  PDE4D  gene polymorphism and risk of IS in the Chinese  population. The results on the association between PDE4D  SNP 87 and the risk of IS are contentious and debatable.
