#  Abstract  

Tumor necrosis factor $\upalpha$   (TNF-α) is a pro inflammatory pleiotropic cytokine which may contribute to the initiation and progression of ischemic stroke (IS). Thus far, numerous studies  have been performed to examine the association between –238G/A (rs361525) and –308G/A  (rs1800629) polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   gene and susceptibility to  IS, but results are still conflicting. The aim of this meta-analysis is to provide a relatively comprehensive account of the association between TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   –238G/A and –308G/A gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to IS. A literature search for eligible candidate gene studies published before April 20, 2015, was conducted in the PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google  Scholar databases. The following combinations of main keywords were used: (‘Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha’ or ‘TNF $\alpha^{\prime}$  ) and (‘ischemic stroke’ or ‘cerebral infarction’ or ‘IS’) and (‘genetic polymorphism’ or ‘single nucleotide polymorphisms’ or   $'{\mathsf{S N P}}^{\prime})$  ). Fixed- or random-effect  models were used to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI).  Meta-analysis was carried out by using RevMan 5.3 software. For TNF $\upalpha\,{-}238\,\upalpha\,{\upDelta}$   gene polymorphism, 7 case-control studies with a total of 1,846 IS patients and 1,905 controls showed  a significant association with susceptibility to IS under a dominant model   $(\mathsf{A A}\,+\,\mathsf{G A}$   vs. GG;  OR, 1.40;  $95\%$   CI, 1.11–1.76; p value 0.004). For TNF $\upalpha-308\up G/\upDelta$   gene polymorphism, 16 casecontrol studies with a total of 5,651 IS patients and 5,792 controls showed a significant protective association with susceptibility to IS under a dominant model   $(\mathsf{A A}+\mathsf{G A}$   vs. GG; OR, 0.78,   $95\%$   CI,  $0.63{-}0.97;$   p value 0.03). Our meta-analysis shows that TNF $\upalpha\,{-}238\,\upzeta/\upDelta$   gene polymorphism is more likely to be associated with the risk of IS in Caucasian populations as compared  to Asian populations. However, TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   –308G/A gene polymorphism is more likely to be protective against IS in Asian populations as compared to Caucasian populations. Further large,  well-designed prospective epidemiological studies are needed to confirm these findings.

#  Introduction  

Stroke is one the leading causes of death in the world and a common cause of disability  [1, 2]  . Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multi factorial, polygenic, complex disease resulting from the  combination of vascular, environmental and genetic factors   [3]  . Inflammation and genetics  are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogen es is of IS   [4]  . Candidate genes, stroke-susceptible alleles and their association with stroke pathogen es is have been intensely studied in the  last few years   [5–7]  . Tumor necrosis factor $\upalpha$   (TNF $\upalpha$  ) is a pleiotropic pro inflammatory  cytokine which is mainly produced by macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer cells and  neurons   [8]  . The human TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   gene is located on chromosome 6p21.3, which consists of 4  small exons and encodes a protein of 233 amino acid residues.  

TNF $\upalpha$   is known to play a significant role in the recruitment of leukocytes from the circulation, and therefore is a crucial determinant of inflammatory reaction in stroke   [9, 10]  . TNF $\upalpha$    is also considered as a strongly deleterious cytokine in stroke and is involved in the expansion  of brain infarcts. On the other hand, there is a suggestion that TNF $\upalpha$   may also play a neuroprotective role in stroke through down regulation of apoptosis   [11, 12]  . Genetic screening of  the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   gene has revealed  $-238\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   and   $-308\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   polymorphic regions in the promoter  region of TNF $\upalpha$  , which has been associated with high TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   production. The increased level  of TNF $\upalpha$   has severe effects on lipid metabolism, coagulation and endo the li al function, which  may contribute to the risk of IS   [13, 14]  . However, a higher level of TNF $\upalpha$   might be expected  to be associated with increased stroke risk, but some epidemiological evidence is of no significance.  

Previous studies examining the association between TNF $\cdot\alpha-238\mathrm{G/A}$   and   $-308\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   gene  polymorphisms and IS showed inconclusive and contradictory results. Therefore, we  performed a meta-analysis on all the published case-control studies to assess the association  of TNF $\cdot\alpha-238\mathrm{G/A}$   and –308G/A gene polymorphisms with the risk of IS.  

#  Materials and Methods  

Identification of Relevant Studies  

A literature search for eligible candidate gene studies published before April 20, 2015, was conducted  in the PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases. To avoid subjectivity in the choice of the  time point, we fixed April 20, 2015, as the cutoff date for the inclusion of new studies. The following combinations of main keywords were used: (‘tumor necrosis factor-alpha’ or ‘TNF $\cdot\alpha^{\prime}$  ) and (‘ischemic stroke’ or  ‘cerebral infarction’ or ‘IS’) and (‘genetic polymorphism’ or ‘single nucleotide polymorphisms’ or ‘SNP’). The  search was done without language restriction, but only included those studies that were conducted on human  subjects. All references in eligible articles were extensively reviewed to identify additional published articles.  Pooled odds ratios (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CI) were determined for TNF $\upalpha$   gene-disease association. The meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.3 software.  

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  

To be included in the analysis, eligible studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) case-control studies  on the association between the TNF $\upalpha\,{-}238\,\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   or –308G/A gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to IS; (2)  all patients in the candidate studies meeting the diagnostic criteria for IS, and (3) studies with sufficient  available data to calculate ORs with corresponding   $95\%$   CI. The major reasons for excluding studies were:  

![](images/e28456b7da3a6ce62b17472134178eb5a88cba5bb6dc4cb64aabb45f2b4f09b6.jpg)  
Fig. 1.   Flow diagram of the selection of studies and specific reasons for exclusion from the present metaanalysis.  

(1) not a case-control study; (2) duplicate publications with overlapping subjects from the same study, and 

 (3) no available data reported. This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items  for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline   [15]  . No author was contacted regarding the  missing information that was required for the meta-analysis to avoid the risk of retrieval bias   [16]  .  

Data Extraction  

According to the PRISMA guidance, 2 investigators (P.K. and S.M.) independently checked each full-text  report for eligibility and extracted the following data from eligible studies: surname of the first author, year  of publication, country of origin, ethnicity, definition and number of cases and controls, age, sex ratio, genotyping method and genotype frequency, etc. Disagreements were solved by discussion between all authors  until a consensus was reached.  

Quality Assessment  

We also evaluated the methodological quality of every study included in our analysis using a quality  assessment scale developed for genetic association studies   [17]  , which was modified by us to increase the  relevance of our study. This scale took into account both traditional epidemiological considerations and  genetic issues. The scores ranged from 0 (worst) to 16 (best). Details of the scale are presented in  table 1 .  Two authors independently assessed the quality of the included studies. Discrepancies over quality scores  were resolved by discussion with all authors and subsequent consensus.  

Statistical Analysis  

Genotype distributions in the controls were tested for agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  (HWE) using the  $\chi^{2}$  test. The association between the TNF $\upalpha$   genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to IS  was assessed by pooled ORs with their corresponding   $95\%$   CI under three genetic models: dominant,  recessive and co-dominant. Taking into consideration possible heterogeneity between studies, a statistical  test for heterogeneity was first conducted using Cochran’s Q statistics and I  2   metrics   [18]  . We considered the  presence of significant heterogeneity at the   $10\%$   level of significance and values of  $\mathrm{I}^{2}$  exceeding   $50\%$   as an  indicator of significant heterogeneity. When no heterogeneity was found with   $\mathtt{p}<0.10$   or   $\mathrm{I}^{2}$     $50\%$  , a fixedeffect model was used to estimate the pooled ORs and  $95\%$   CI. Otherwise, a random-effect model was applied.  In addition to an overall comparison, stratified analyses based on ethnicity were used to investigate whether  overall reported associations were present in subgroups. Begg’s funnel plot was used to assess the potential  for publication bias.

#  Results  

A total of 67 published articles were identified using the pre specified search strategy.   Figure 1  represents a flow chart of retrieved and excluded studies with their reasons for  exclusion. Out of the 67 retrieved articles, 34 studies were excluded due to their irrelevance  to our interest; 11 studies were excluded as they were in duplicate, and 4 studies were  excluded as they did not show an association with IS. Finally, a total 18 of studies were  included in this meta-analysis.

Association of TNF $_{\alpha}$   –238G/A Gene Polymorphism with Susceptibility to IS  

Seven case-control studies with a total of 1,846 IS patients and 1,905 controls also showed  a significant association with susceptibility to IS under a dominant model   $\mathrm{(AA+GA}$   vs. GG:  OR, 1.40;  $95\%$   CI, 1.11–1.76;  $\mathsf{p}=0.004\$  ). Studies were conducted in two major ethnic populations; 5 studies were in Asian and 2 studies in Caucasian populations. Four studies in this  meta-analysis had controls in HWE. Six studies had population-based controls and 1 study  had hospital-based controls. The quality scores of all included studies were moderately high.  The characteristics and methodological quality of all included studies are summarized in   table 2 .  

Based on ethnicity stratification analysis, a significant association was observed in Caucasian studies (OR, 1.76;  $95\%$   CI, 1.26–2.47;  $\mathsf{p}=0.0009]$  ), but a non significant association was  observed (OR, 1.13;   $95\%$   CI, 0.82–1.55;   $\mathsf{p}=0.45$  ) in Asian studies under a dominant model  ( fig. 2 ). Begg’s funnel plots were used to assess the potential for publication bias of the  included studies under a dominant model. The shapes of the funnel plots suggest a significant  publication bias ( fig. 3 ).  

Association of TNF $_{\alpha}$   –308G/A Gene Polymorphism with Susceptibility to IS  

Sixteen case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis with a total of 5,651 IS  patients and 5,792 controls. Studies were conducted in two major ethnic populations; 9  studies were conducted in Asian and 5 in Caucasian populations. The publication years of the  included studies ranged from 2004 to 2014. Twelve studies in this meta-analysis had controls  in HWE. Twelve studies had population-based controls and 4 studies had hospital-based

controls. The quality scores of all included studies were moderately high. The characteristics  and methodological quality of all included studies are summarized in  table 2 .  

A significant protective association with susceptibility to IS under dominant   $\mathrm{(AA+CA}$   vs.  GG: OR, 0.78;  $95\%$   CI, 0.63–0.97;  $\mathsf{p}=0.03\mathrm{\Omega}$  ), recessive (AA vs.   $\mathrm{GG+GA}$  : OR, 0.75;   $95\%$   CI, 0.51–

 1.11;   $\mathtt{p}=0.15$  ) and co-dominant models (GA vs. AA   $^+$   GG: OR, 0.79;   $95\%$   CI, 0.64–0.97;   $\mathrm{p}=$   

 0.03) was observed. Based on ethnicity stratification analysis, a more significant protective  association with IS was observed under dominant   $\mathrm{[AA+CA}$   vs. GG: OR, 0.67;   $95\%$   CI,   $0.52\mathrm{-}$  0.87;   $\mathsf{p}\,=\,0.003\big]$  ), recessive (AA vs.   $\mathrm{G}\mathrm{G}\;+\;\mathrm{G}\mathrm{A}$  : OR, 0.61;   $95\%$   CI,   $0.34{-}1.09$  ;   $\mathtt{p}\,=\,0.10_{,}^{\cdot}$  ) and  co-dominant models (GA vs. A  $.\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{GG}$  : OR, 0.69;   $95\%$   CI, 0.53–0.89;  $\mathsf{p}=0.004\big]$   in Asian studies  as compared to Caucasian studies under dominant   $\mathrm{7AA+6A}$   vs. GG: OR, 0.94;   $95\%$   CI,   $0.67-$  1.32;   $\mathsf{p}\,=\,0.73\big]$  ), recessive (AA vs.   $\mathrm{GG\;+\;GA}$  : OR, 0.89;   $95\%$   CI, 0.53–1.49;   $\mathtt{p}\,=\,0.66$  ) and  co-dominant models (GA vs. AA  $\uplambda+\mathrm{GG}$  : OR, 0.93;   $95\%$   CI,   $0.67{-}1.30$  ;   ${\tt p}=0.68$  ;  fig. 4 ). Begg’s  funnel plots were used to assess the potential for publication bias of the included studies  under a dominant model. The shapes of the funnel plots suggest a significant publication bias  ( fig. 5 ).  

#  Discussion  

According to the results of the present meta-analysis, TNF $\upalpha$   $\mathfrak{c}-238\mathrm{G/A}$   polymorphism  increases the risk of IS, but TNF $\upalpha\mathrm{~-}3086/\mathrm{A}$   polymorphism appears to protect against IS.  However, a recessive model of Caucasian studies involving 1,449 cases and 1,767 controls  suggests that the   $-308\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   variant might be a risk factor for IS. In the subgroup analysis by  ethnicity, a more significant increased risk of IS was found in Caucasian studies as compared  to Asian studies for   $-238\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   TNF $\upalpha$  gene polymorphism. Based on ethnicity stratification,  varying results were obtained, which may be due to different genetic regions and environments having different religions, languages and customs. The differences in the genetic backgrounds of smoking, alcohol intake, diet, infection, congenital or acquired heart disease, and  metabolic and hematological disorders may represent risk factors for IS. The protective  nature of TNF $\cdot\alpha-308\;\mathrm{G/A}$   gene polymorphisms may be due to the modest effect played by  this molecular gene variant along with the notion of a multi factorial and polygenic etiology of  IS, where each genetic determinant plays a small contributory role.

(For figure 4b, c see next pages.)  

We included all the recently published studies to extract more evidence and draw a  precise conclusion for the association between TNF $\upalpha$   gene polymorphisms and the risk of IS.  Our findings are in accordance with the previously published meta-analyses by Gu et al.   [18]    for –238G/A polymorphism and Gu et al.   [19]   and Pereira et al.   [20]   for  $-308\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   polymorphism. Various genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for stroke have been published  [36–41]  , but most of these study populations were of Caucasian origin, and they did not detect  the association of TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   $\iota\ -238\mathrm{G/A}$   and   $-308\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   polymorphisms in the TNF $\upalpha$  gene with  stroke. Indeed, similar negative results were obtained from the European populations reported by Freilinger et al.   [42]  . Recently, due to the small sample size in stage 1 of GWAS  screening (131 cases and 135 controls), the GWAS performed in the Japanese population   [39]    did not have a sufficient power to observe a positive association.  

The present meta-analysis must be interpreted with caution because of certain limitations. First, the studies included in this meta-analysis varied in ethnicity, age and environmental factors. Second, the use of different methodologies for the genotyping method,  

![](images/91a4a04f936389fc5328a9052b5b46355ec773b86938d626737ad4082b4819f6.jpg)  

selection of controls and matching criteria may have led to heterogeneity. Third, not all other  variants (–857C/T, –863C/A, –1031T/C) located in the human TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   promoter gene were  assessed in this study. Complete sequencing will be necessary for systematic identification of  potentially causative mutations in the TNF $\upalpha$   whole-gene function region.  

In addition, genetic tests are needed to assess the clinical utility of drugs and doses  routinely used to treat patients with stroke or at risk of stroke. The protective nature of TNF $\upalpha$    gene polymorphism may be beneficial to patients based on genotyping and functional assay  of the whole TNF $\upalpha$   promoter gene. Finding a link between inflammatory genetic markers and  cerebro vascular events will certainly require a careful study of well-characterized and phenotypically homogeneous subjects as well as meticulous analyses of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions by prospective studies. The prospective design will be important not  only to avoid survival bias, but also to address issues under explored thus far, such as age at  stroke. Also, additional approaches such as haplotypic analysis with markers in the vicinity  of TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   may provide more informative and useful data for the study of the genetic etiology  of cerebro vascular diseases than single-genotype-based data.

In summary, the present meta-analysis shows a protective effect of TNF $\cdot\alpha-308\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   gene  polymorphism on IS risk, but a significant association was observed between TNF $\cdot\alpha-238\mathrm{G/A}$    gene polymorphism and the risk of IS. However, TNF $\cdot\alpha-308\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   gene polymorphism might  be associated with IS as observed in the recessive model of the Caucasian population. More  credible evidence is required to draw solid conclusions on the association between TNF $\upalpha$    –238G/A and –308G/A gene polymorphisms and the risk of IS.  

#  Conclusion  

Our meta-analysis shows that TNF $\upalpha-238\mathrm{G/A}$   gene polymorphism is more likely to be  associated with the risk of IS in Caucasian populations than in Asian populations. However,  TNF $\cdot\alpha-308\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   gene polymorphism is more likely to be protective against IS in Asian populations as compared to Caucasian populations. Further large, prospective, epidemiological  studies are needed to confirm these findings.
