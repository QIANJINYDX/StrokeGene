To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of eicosanoid biosynthesis genes are associated with intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and ischemic stroke (IS), seven SNPs in the coding or promoter regions were selected: ALOX12 (rs434473, Asn322Ser), ALOX5 (rs2228064, Thr90Thr),  $-404\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$   '   (rs3842788, Gln41Gln) and PTGS2 (rs5275, 3 0 UTR). A total of 398 control subjects and 196 stroke patients (79 ICH and 117 IS) were genotyped by direct sequencing. The rs17222919 SNP was associated with ICH in codominant 1   $(P{=}0.008)$  , dominant   $(P{=}0.003)$  ) and log-additive   $'\!P\!\!=\!0.004\!,$   models. Allele frequencies of rs17222919 were different between ICH and controls   $'P{=}0.007$  ). However, the seven tested SNPs were not associated with clinical phenotypes (NIHSS, MBI and CRPS) in ICH and IS. These results suggest that the promoter SNP rs17222919 of ALOX5AP may be associated with the development of ICH in Korean population.

These regulators also arise through ALOX5 metabolism of 15 S - hydro per oxy ei cosa tetra en oic acid (15 S  -HPETE), the metabolism of arachidonic acid by ara chi donate 15-lip oxygen as e, type B (ALOX15B, 15-LOX-2)  [4 – 6 ] ( Fig. 1 ).  

# 1. Introduction  

Ei cosa noid s such as prostaglandin s (PGs) and leu kotri ene s (LTs) play an important role in the in amma tory process, and also contribute to the pathogen es is of stroke  [1 – 3 ]. In PG biosynthesis, two PG-endo peroxide synthases (PTGSs), also known as cyclooxygenases (COXs), convert arachidonic acid into PG endo peroxides. PTGS1 (COX1) is constitutive ly expressed, but PTGS2 (COX2) is inducible. Thromboxane and prost a cyclin (PGI2) are generated from PGH2. PGH2 is metabolized by thromboxane A synthase 1 (platelet) (TBXAS1, CYP5A1) and PGI2 synthase (PTGIS) to thromboxane A2 and PGI2, respectively. There are three PGE2 synthases: glut at hi onedependent prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), membrane-associated PTGES2 and cytosolic PTGES3 ( Fig. 1 ). Ara chi donate 5-lip oxygen as e (ALOX5, 5-LOX) together with ALOX5-activating protein (ALOX5AP, FLAP) initializes LT biosynthesis from arachidonic acid. In platelets, ara chi donate 12-lip oxygen as e (ALOX12, 12-LOX) catalyzes the conversion of LTA4, the primary product of ALOX5, to the lipoxins LXA4 and LXB4 as known lipid mediators or regulators of resolution.  

In recent, several genetic studies have reported on the relationship between variants of eicosanoid biosynthesis genes and stroke. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs20417) of PTGS2 acts as an inherited protective factor against myocardial infarction and stroke  [7] . Two PTGS2 variants (rs20417 and rs5275) have been linked with 90-days stroke functional outcome  [8] . The TBXAS1 gene polymorphisms may be a useful marker for the development of cerebral infarction, especially the small-artery occlusion type in Korean population  [9] . Frequencies of   $\mathsf{T B X A S1}+\mathsf{16184G>T}$   and TBXAS1-haplotype were signiﬁ- cantly more frequent in cerebral infarction, spec i call y in smallartery occlusion (SAO) type of cerebral infarction. The SNP SG13S114T/A (rs10597391) in ALOX5AP has been associated with an increased risk for a the roth rom bot ic stroke in Chinese males [10] . CYP4F2 is involved not only in the metabolism of LTB4, but also in that of arachidonic acid. CYP4F2 gene haplotype has been associated with cerebral infarction in Japanese males  [11] .  

Although ei cosa noid s may be related to stroke susceptibility, the genetic determinants are not fully deﬁned. In this light, analysis of their SNPs might be very important.

ICH, intra cerebral hemorrhage; IS, ischemic stroke; NIHSS, National Institutes of Health Stroke Survey; MBI, Modiﬁed Barthel Index; CRPS, complex regional pain syndrome. IS and ICH patients with inappropriate clinical data were excluded.  

In this study, we investigated the association between eicosanoid biosynthesis genes (ALOX12, ALOX5, ALOX5AP, PTGES, PTGIS, PTGS1 and PTGS2) and stroke, and their clinical phenotypes in Korean population.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. Study population and clinical phenotypes  

Stoke patients were recruited at the Stroke Center of East– West Neo-Medical Center in Kyung Hee Medical Center (Seoul, Republic of Korea) from October 2007 to December 2009. The 196 stroke patients consisted of 79 intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients (42 males/37 females) and 117 ischemic stroke (IS) patients (64 males/53 females) ( Table 1 ). Subjects with transient ischemic attack, brain tumors, congenital brain disorders, cardi- ovascular malformation, chronic in amma tory diseases, autoimmune diseases and neuro psychiatric disorders were excluded. Each stroke patient was diagnosed through neurological examinations, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography and duplex sonography. All stroke patients were classiﬁed into three clinical phenotypes using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Survey (NIHSS) score, the Modiﬁed Barthel Index (MBI) score and the presence or absence of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). For the prognosis of stroke patients, the severity of 13 neurological symptoms was assessed by the NIHSS score. For hospitalization, the quality of 10 activities of general life was estimated by the MBI score. Control subjects (  $\cdot n\!=\!398$  , 194 males/204 females) were enrolled among healthy volunteers to examine the general health check-up program ( Table 1 ). Participants with symptoms or history of neurological diseases, ischemic heart diseases and any severe diseases were excluded. This study was approved by the ethics review committee of Medical Research Institute, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, and each subject gave written informed consent.  

# 2.2. SNP selection and genotyping  

The SNPs in the coding or promoter regions of eicosanoid biosynthesis genes were searched at the dbSNP database ( www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP , BUILD 131). SNPs with unknown heterozygosity, minor allele frequency below   $10\%$   and mono m orphic/ unknown genotype in Asians were excluded. Finally, seven SNPs were selected and analyzed: ALOX12 (rs434473, Asn322Ser),  $-\,1316\,\mathrm{T}/$     $-404\,\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$    PTGS1 (rs3842788, Gln41Gln) and PTGS2 (rs5275, 3 0 UTR). Peripheral blood samples were collected from all participants. s   Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) and genotypes were determined by direct sequencing (MACROGEN, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with sense and antisense primers for each SNP ( Table 2 ). PCR comprised 40 cycles at   $94~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for   $30\,s$  ,  $58~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,s$  ,   $72~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 30 s and 1 cycle at   $72\,^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for  $5\;\mathrm{min}$   for the ﬁnal reaction. The PCR products were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3730XL analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and sequence data were analyzed using SeqManII software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA).  

# 2.3. Statistics  

Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was assessed by the Chi-squared test. SNP Analyzer Pro (ISTECH, Goyang, Republic of Korea), Helixtree (Golden Helix, Bozeman, MT, USA) and SNPStats ( http://bioinfo.icon co logia.net/index.php?module  $:=$  Snpstats ) were used to analyze genetic data. Multiple logistic regression models (codominant 1, codominant 2, dominant, recessive and logadditive) were performed to determine odds ratios (ORs),   $95\%$  conﬁdence intervals (CIs) and  $P$   values, controlling for age and

gender as co variables. For the statistical power, the required case size in each SNP was calculated using the genetic power calculator ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/&sim;purcell/gpc/cc2. html ). The statistical sign i can ce level was considered at  $P<0.05$  .  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. Clinical characteristics of stroke patients and control subjects  

The clinical features of patients with stroke and control subjects are presented in  Table 1 . The age of ICH, IS and control subjects (mean   $\mathsf{a g e\pm S D}$  ) were  $56.1\pm12.5$  ,  $65.5\pm12.1$   and  $53.8\pm{12.2}$   years, respectively. Stroke patients were divided into three clinical phenotypes according to NIHSS (scores of 13 neurological symptoms;    $<6$   or    $\geq6$  ), MBI (scores of 10 activities of general life;    $<60$   or    $\geq60$  ), CRPS (present or absent), hypertension (present or absent) and diabetes mellitus (present or absent). The number of ICH patients with NIHSS scores    $<6$   and    $\geq6$   were 24 and 55, respectively. The number of ICH patients with MBI scores    $<60$   and  $\ge60$   were 65 and 14, respectively. The number of ICH patients with CRPS present and absent were 66 and 13, respectively. The number of ICH patients with hypertension absent and present were 18 and 59, respectively. The number of ICH patients with diabetes mellitus absent and present were 65 and 12, respectively. Among IS patients, 57 and 60 subjects displayed NIHSS scores of    $<6$   and    $\geq6$  , respectively, 92 and 25 subjects displayed MBI scores of    $<60$   and  $\ge60$  , respectively, and 94 and 23 subjects displayed CRPS present and absent, respectively. The number of IS patients with hypertension absent and present were 35 and 77, respectively. The number of IS patients with diabetes mellitus absent and present were 68 and 45, respectively ( Table 1 ).  

# 3.2. Genotyping of each SNP  

Multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and gender was performed using the following: codominant 1

 (major allele homozygotes versus heterozygotes), codominant 2

 (major allele homozygotes versus minor allele homozygotes), dominant (major allele homozygotes versus heterozygotes  $^+$  minor allele homozygotes), recessive (major allele homozygotes þ heterozygotes versus minor allele homozygotes) and logadditive (major allele homozygotes versus heterozygotes versus minor allele homozygotes).  

The genotype and allele frequencies of the seven selected SNPs are presented in  Tables 3–5 . There was no deviation in HWE for any SNP   $\cdot P\geq0.05$  , data not shown). In  Table 3 , the    $-\,1316\,\mathrm{T}/\mathrm{G})$   of ALOX5AP was associated with ICH in codominant 1 (  $P{=}0.008$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.46$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}\!=\!0.26\!-\!0.82\bigtimes$  ), dominant   $'P{=}0.003$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.45$  ,   $95\%$     ${\mathsf{C I}}\!=\!0.26\!-$  0.79) and log-additive (  $P{=}0.004$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.51$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}\!=\!0.26\!-\!0.83\big]$  )  

models. The synonymous SNP (rs5628, Leu256Leu) of PTGIS was very weakly associated with ICH in codominant 1 (  $\scriptstyle{P=0.039}$  ,

  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.84$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}\!=\!1.01\!-\!3.35\!,$  ) and dominant (  ${\it P}{=}0.039$  ,   $\mathrm{{OR}}{=}$  1.84,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}\!=\!1.01\!-\!3.35\!,$  ) models. The 3 0 UTR SNP (rs5275) of PTGS2 was also very weakly associated with ICH in codominant 1 model (  $\cdot_{}P{=}0.040$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.71$  ,  $95\%\,\mathsf{C I}\!=\!1.02\!-\!2.86$  ).  

In  Table 5 , the G allele frequency of rs17222919 of ALOX5AP was higher in the ICH group than in the control group   $'86.7\%$  versus  $23.0\%$  ;  $P{=}0.007$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.95$  ,   $95\%\,{\sf C I}\!=\!1.20\!-\!3.17$  ). The T allele frequency of rs5628 of PTGIS was different between ICH and controls (  $11.4\%$   versus   $6.8\%$  ;    $P{=}0.048$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.77$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}\!=\!1.01\!-$  3.10). However, the rs17222919, rs5628 and rs5275 SNPs were not associated with IS. ( Table 4 ) As shown in  Tables 3–5 , other four SNPs (rs434473 of ALOX12, rs2228064 of ALOX5, rs7872802 of PTGES and rs3842788 of PTGS1) were not associated with ICH and IS. The results suggest that the G allele of rs17222919 in the promoter region of ALOX5AP may be a risk factor for the development of ICH in Korean population.  

# 3.3. Analysis of clinical phenotypes  

All stroke patients were classiﬁed into clinical phenotypes according to the NIHSS score (  $<6$   or    $\geq6$  ), the MBI score (  $<60$   or  $\geq60.$  ), present or absent CRPS, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. When we assessed the genetic relationships between SNPs of eicosanoid biosynthesis genes and diabetes mellitus, ALOX5 (rs2228064) and PTGS1 (rs3842788) were found to show differences between IS patients without diabetes mellitus and IS patients with diabetes mellitus (rs2228064,  $P{=}0.01$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.11$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}\!=\!0.01\!-\!\!0.93$  ; rs3842788,    $P{=}0.033$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.28$  ,   $95\%$     ${\mathsf{C I}}\!=$   $0.08{-}0.98$  , data not shown). ALOX5 and PTGS1 may be related to IS with diabetes mellitus. However, we did not ﬁnd any associations between the tested SNPs and the other clinical phenotypes of either ICH or IS (data not shown).  

# 3.4. Sample power  

For the required sample size, we calculated the sample power using a genetic power calculator. The sample powers of the SNPs in the ICH group were 0.73 for rs434473 (  $\alpha{=}0.05$  , genotype relative risk  $=$  two-fold,    $n$   of case for   $70\%$   power  $\mathrm{\Sigma=}73$  ), 0.22 for rs2228064

  $\cdot n\!=\!388)$  , 0.82 for rs17222910  $'n\!=\!58.$  , 0.46 for rs7872802

  $\cdot n\!=\!140,$  ), 0.35 for rs5628   $'n\!=\!197$  ), 0.83 for rs3842788   $(n\!=\!57)$  and 0.47 for rs5275 (  $\cdot n\!=\!173,$  ). The sample powers of the SNPs in the IS group were 0.83 for rs434473   $\cdot n\!=\!85.$  ), 0.28 for rs2228064

  $\cdot n\!=\!379)$  , 0.91 for rs17222910 (  $\cdot n\!=\!66.$  , 0.55 for rs7872802

  $\cdot n\!=\!166)$  , 0.41 for rs5628   $\cdot n\!=\!242$  ), 0.91 for rs3842788   $(n{=}65)$  ) and 0.58 for rs5275   $'n\!=\!195,$  ). In comparison to the numbers of ICH   $(n\!=\!79)$   and IS   $(n\!=\!117)$   patients in the present study, the subjects for rs434473, rs17222910 and rs3842788 were enough, whereas those for rs2228064, rs7872802, rs5628 and rs5275 were in suf cie nt ( Table 6 ). Therefore, the result of a promoter

SNP (rs17222919,  ' 1316T/G) of ALOX5AP had statistical conﬁdence, but those of a coding SNP (rs5628, Leu256Leu) of PTGIS did not.  

# 4. Discussion  

LTs play the pathological roles in in amma tory diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atherosclerosis. ALOX5AP together with ALOX5 is involved in the initial step of LTs biosynthesis in metabolism of arachidonic acid.  [12 , 13 ]. Variants of the ALOX5AP gene have been implicated in the risk for asthma  [14] , chronic rhino sinusitis  [15] , atherosclerosis  [16 , 17 ], myocardial infarction [18 , 19 ] and especially, stroke  [19 – 25 ]. Helga do ttir et al.  [19] reported that ALOX5AP variants were involved in the pathogenesis of both myocardial infarction and stroke by increasing LT production and in amma tion in the arterial wall. A signiﬁcant association between a haplotype of ALOX5AP and stroke was replicated in Scottish population [20] . ALOX5AP variants (SG13S114 and SG13S100) were sign i cant ly associated with stroke in central European population and theses associations were stronger in males than in females  [21] . DominguesMontanari et al.  [22]  also showed that the SG13S114 SNP was an independent risk factor for IS in Iberian population and was associated with ALOX5AP expression levels. The ALOX5AP SNPs (rs9579646 and rs4769874) were sign i cant ly associated with IS among Whites, but not Blacks  [23] . In contrast, a prospective study reported no evidence for an association of the speciﬁc Icelandic ALOX5AP variants/haplotypes tested with risk of incident myocardial infarction or IS in White males  [24] . Zintzaras et al.  [25]  reported that a meta-analysis showed no signiﬁcant association between the ALOX5AP SNPs (SG13S114, SG13S89, SG13S25, SG13S32, SG13S35 and SG13S42) and the stroke, while the SG13S106 and SG13S377 SNPs were weakly associated with the stroke. Although previous reports have been inconsistent, the present result reveals that a promoter SNP (rs17222919, ' 1316T/G) of ALOX5AP contributes to ICH susceptibility in Korean population ( Table 2 ).  

In the SNP database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP , BUILD 131), the G and T allele frequencies in the rs17222919 SNP have been reported to be 0.097–0.161 and 0.839–0.903 in European, 0.152 and 0.848 in African American, 0.170 and 0.830 in Japanese, and 0.244 and 0.756 in Chinese, respectively. In our control group, the G and T allele frequencies were 0.230 and 0.770, which are similar to those seen in Chinese population. There is ethnic difference in the allele distributions of rs17222919. In our study, the G allele frequency of rs17222919 in the ICH group was about 3.8-fold   $(86.7\%)$  , compared to that in the control group   $(23.0\%)$  . The result suggests that the G allele may be a risk factor for the development of ICH.

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report that the promoter SNP (rs17222919,  ' 1316T/G) of ALOX5AP is associated with ICH in Korean population. To investigate whether this genetic variant affects transcription factors, we performed the online program AliBaba2.1 ( www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs/alibaba2 ). We found that g luc oc or tico id receptor binds to the T-containing

sequences, but no transcription factor binds to the G-containing sequences in the rs17222919 site. Therefore, the difference in transcription factor binding may inﬂuence the expression of ALOX5AP.  

Moreover, we classiﬁed the ICH and IS groups into clinical phenotypes (NIHSS score, MBI score and CRPS) and tested the relationship between clinical phenotypes and the seven selected SNPs of eicosanoid biosynthesis genes. We found that ALOX5 (rs2228064) and PTGS1 (rs3842788) showed differences between IS patients with diabetes mellitus and IS patients without diabetes mellitus. As our sample sizes are small, additional studies with large samples and other populations could be conducted to conﬁrm our results.  

In conclusion, we report that the promoter SNP (rs17222919,  $-\,1316\Gamma/G)$   of the ALOX5AP gene is associated with ICH, but not IS, in Korean population.
