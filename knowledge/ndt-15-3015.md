Background:  Stroke ranks as the third-leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. ANGPTL3 plays important roles in lipid metabolism, atherosclerosis, and occurrence of stroke. The purpose of this study was to evaluate associations of genetic variants in the ANGPTL3  gene with ischemic stroke (IS) risk.  

Methods:  A case – control study was conducted to evaluate the associations of tag singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the  ANGPTL3  gene and risk of IS, as well as serum lipid levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assays in the HEK293T cell line was conducted to evaluate the promoter activity of  ANGPTL3  rs6690733.  

Results:  We found rs6690733 (C vs A: OR 1.34,   $95\%$   CI 1.13 – 1.59;    ${\it P}{=}0.001$  ) and rs12563308 (C vs T: OR 0.77,  $95\%$   CI 0.64 – 0.93,  ${\it P}{=}0.007$  ) were signi ﬁ cantly associated with susceptibility to IS. Even corrected for Bonferroni adjustment, the two variants were still signi ﬁ cant   $\left.0.007\times4{=}0.028\right\}$  ). Carriers of the minor allele of SNP rs6690733 had signi ﬁ cantly higher levels of TC and LDL-C, while carriers of the minor allele of SNP rs12563308 had signi ﬁ cantly lower levels of TC and LDL-C (all  $P{<}0.05$  ). For rs6690733, the luciferase assay showed that promoter activity was signi ﬁ cantly increased by   $67\%$   of plasmids containing the minor C allele compared with the major A allele in HEK293 cells. Conclusion:  ANGPTL3  

Our study revealed genetic variants of the  gene could contribute to susceptibility to IS through participating in the regulation of lipid metabolism.

# Introduction  

A major threat to health and quality of human life, stroke has raised public concern.   According to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study, stroke causes 6.1673 million deaths annually and is the third-leading cause of years of life lost worldwide.   In China, stroke (over 2 million new cases annually) has been associated with the highest disability.   The rising global burden of stroke-related disability provided the impetus to direct our research focus toward risk factors and effective measures of stroke prevention.   Ischemic stroke (IS) accounts for about   $87\%$   of all strokes, while atherosclerosis is a major cause of IS. ,   It is estimated that extra cranial and intra cranial large-vessel atherosclerosis account for about  $20\%$   of IS cases.   Therefore, exploration of related mechanisms of atherosclerosis is of great signi ﬁ cance for the prevention and treatment of IS.  

ANGPTL3, an endogenous inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase and endo the li al lipase, is involved in the metabolic regulation of triglycerides, LDL-C, and HDL-C, as  

,   well as atherosclerosis in mice and humans. Exon sequencing has revealed that  ANGPTL3  mutations play an important role in LDL-C metabolism in humans.   A large-scale epidemiological study also identi ﬁ ed that genetic and therapeutic antagonism of ANGPTL3 in humans and mice was associated with decreased levels of all three major lipid fractions and decreased odds of at hero sclerotic cardiovascular disease.   In the current study, we hypothesized that genetic variants of the ANGPTL3  gene could also in ﬂ uence susceptibility to IS, one major consequence of abnormal lipid metabolism. We conducted this case – control study in a Chinese population, with functional validation experiments in vitro to test our hypotheses.  

# Methods Study subjects  

Consecutive IS patients were prospectively screened for enrollment, with the diagnosis con ﬁ rmed by two neurologists. Diagnosis of IS was based on clinical history and neurological examination of patients and con ﬁ rmed by brain computed-tomography imaging and basal laboratory tests. Patients were excluded if they had a history of stroke, had received treatment before admission, including statins, or had systemic diseases. Healthy controls were recruited from people without a history of stroke, myocardial infarction, or systemic diseases receiving health examinations in our hospital during the same study period. Finally, 989 IS patients and 990 healthy volunteers were included in this study. All participants were interviewed face to face using a structured questionnaire. Venous blood  $(5\,\mathrm{\mL})$  ) was collected from each study subject by venipuncture in EDTA-containing tubes, and genomic DNA was isolated from fresh blood samples using a TianAmp blood DNA kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) and stored at    $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until further use. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Minhang Branch of Zhongshan Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from every participant, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The STROBE checklist is given in  Supplementary  ﬁ le 1 .  

# Single-nucleotide polymorphism selection and genotyping  

With Haploview 4.2 software, tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) within the  ANGPTL3  gene and its  $10~\mathrm{~kb~}$   ﬂ anking region were selected according to the criteria of minor-allele frequency  ${>}5\%$   in the Chinese Han population in 1,000-genome phase III data. Linkaged is equilibrium    $r^{2}$    values should be   ${<\!0.8}$   for candidate SNPs. Finally, four candidate SNPs (rs12048208, rs6690733, rs12563308, and rs72641123) were included in this case – control study. Genotyping was conducted with TaqMan on an ABI Prism 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). For quality control,   $5\%$   of the samples were randomly selected for repeated genotyping. Repeatability of results was   $100\%$  .  

# Plasmid constructs, cell culture, and luciferase assays  

To construct reporter plasmids with ANGPTL3 promoters, promoter fragments containing rs6690733 were ampli ﬁ ed and subcloned into KpnI and XhoI restriction sites upstream of the luciferase gene in a pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The recombinant plasmids were veri ﬁ ed by DNA sequencing. Then, HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with   $10\%$   FBS. Transfection s with   $800\;\mathrm{\,ng}$   of each ANGPTL3 reporter plasmid (pGL3-basic, pGL3-G, and pGL3-A) were conducted using Lip of ect amine 3000 (Invitrogen) for each cell line. Luciferase assays were performed 24 hours later using a dual-luciferase reporter – assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions. Three independent experiments were performed for each reporter.  

# Statistical analysis  

Differences in the distribution of demographic variables between IS cases and healthy controls were evaluated by Pearson ’ s  $\chi^{2}$    or Student ’ s    $t\cdot$  -test. The distribution of genotypes for the four tagSNPs was evaluated for violation of Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium by Pearson's    $\chi^{2}$    test. ORs and  $95\%$   CIs from logistic regression analyses were calculated to estimate the association between genetic polymorphisms of the  ANGPTL3  gene and risk of IS adjusted for age, sex, smoking and drinking status, body-mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.  $P{<}0.05$   (two-sided) was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant, and all analyses were conducted with SPSS version 22.

# Associations between genetic variants of the  ANGPTL3  gene and susceptibility to IS  

Genotype distributions of  ANGPTL3  polymorphisms and their associations with IS risk are shown in  Table 2 . TGenotype frequencies of rs12048208, rs6690733, rs12563308, and rs72641123 in the controls were concordant with Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium   $_{(P>0.05)}$  . For tagSNPs, we found rs6690733 (C vs A: OR 1.34,   $95\%$  CI 1.13 – 1.59;    ${\it P}{=}0.001$  ), and rs12563308 (C vs T: OR 0.77,  $95\%$   CI  $.\0.64–0.93$  ;  $P{=}0.007]$  ) were signi ﬁ cantly associated with susceptibility to IS. Even corrected for Bonferroni adjustment, the two variants were still signi ﬁ cant (  $\left(0.007\!\times\!4\!\!=\!\!0.028\right)$  ). For rs6690733, compared with major AA homozygotes, both AC heterozygotes

 (OR 1.35,  $95\%$   CI 1.10 – 1.66) and minor CC homozygotes

 (OR 1.81,   $95\%$   CI 1.07 – 3.04) were associated with increased susceptibility to IS. For rs12563308, compared with major TT homozygotes, both TC heterozygotes (OR

 0.82,  $95\%$   CI 0.67 – 1.00) and minor CC homozygotes (OR

 0.43,   $95\%$   CI 0.18 – 1.00) were associated with decreased susceptibility to IS. We did not  ﬁ nd signi ﬁ cant associations for variants rs12048208 and rs7264112.  

# Associations of  ANGPTL3  rs6690733 and rs12563308 and serum-lipid levels in controls  

To further explore the effect of  ANGPTL3 variants on lipid metabolism, we evaluated associations of  ANGPTL3 rs6690733 and rs12563308 and serum-lipid levels in controls. As shown in  Table 3 , we found that carriers of the minor allele of SNP rs6690733 had signi ﬁ cantly higher levels of TC and LDL-C, while carriers of the minor allele of SNP rs12563308 had signi ﬁ cantly lower levels of TC and LDL-C (all  $P{<}0.05$  ).  

# Promoter-activity analysis of  ANGPTL3 rs6690733  

To evaluate the promoter activity of variant rs6690733, we performed in vitro luciferase promoter assays. As shown in  Figure 1 , assays showed that promoter activity was signi ﬁ cantly increased by   $67\%$   of plasmids containing the minor C allele compared with the major A allele in HEK293 cells. This suggested that the C allele has higher transcription activity than the A allele.  

# Discussion  

We explored associations between genetic variants of the ANGPTL3  gene and susceptibility to IS in a large-scale case – control study in a Chinese population. We found that rs6690733 and rs12563308 were signi ﬁ cantly associated with susceptibility to IS. Also, carriers of the minor allele of SNP rs6690733 had signi ﬁ cantly higher levels of TC and LDL-C, while carriers of the minor allele of SNP rs12563308 had signi ﬁ cantly lower levels of TC and LDL-C. Further dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that the   $\mathrm{rs}6690733\mathrm{~C~}$   allele had lower levels of luciferase activity than the rs6690733 A allele. Our  ﬁ ndings indicate that  ANGPTL3  rs6690733 and rs12563308 may contribute

ANGPTL3  has been mapped to the 1p31 region, and is expressed principally in the liver.  ${}^{12}\operatorname{In}2002$  , Koishi et al 9   ﬁ rst that reported ANGPTL3 could regulate lipid metabolism in mice. It can decrease very low – density lipoprotein – triglyceride clearance by inhibition of lipoprotein lipase and stimulate endo the li al cell adhesion and migration via integrin  $\upalpha_{\mathrm{v}}\upbeta_{3}$  , and ,   induces blood-vessel formation. For these reasons, it was thought to be a new drug target for treatment of dys lipid emi a very early.   Clinical studies revealed that plasma ANGPTL3 was associated with arterial wall thickness, uremic dys lipid emi a, hepatic triglyceride lipase, and rheumatic – 18   diseases. Genetic variants of  ANGPTL3  have also been evaluated in many different kinds of diseases. , – 24   Járomi et   $\mathrm{{a}l^{25}}$    evaluated the association of  ANGPTL3  rs12130333 (minor-allele frequency in Chinese was 0.024) with risk of IS in 459 Caucasian stroke patients and 168 control subjects using PCR and restriction fragment length – polymorphism methods and got null results, which might have been caused 26   by low statistical power. Bokor et al found that the ANGPTL3  rs11207997 polymorphism (which was in high linkage d is equilibrium with rs6690733) was associated with lower plasma HDL-C in adolescents. In a previous study by

Figure 1  Effects of the promoter polymorphism rs6690733 of  ANGPTL3  gene on transcription activity.  

Notes:  Transcription activity was measured using an in vitro luciferase assay, and results are shown as means  $\pm\textsf{S D.}$   Data expressed as fold increase in luciferase activity relative to pGL3-A. One-way ANOVA was used to assess statistical signi ﬁ cance.  

Li et al,   rs12563308 SNP was associated with a decreased risk of coronary artery disease (dominant  —  OR 0.69,  $95\%$  CI 0.45 – 0.94,  ${\it P}{=}0.011$  ; log-additive  —  OR 0.73,   $95\%$   CI 0.49 – 0.89,  $\scriptstyle P=0.009$  ), but not susceptibility to IS. This might have been caused by limited statistical power. In our study, we not only found rs12563308 was signi ﬁ cantly associated with decreased risk of IS but also detected carriers of the minor allele of SNP rs12563308 had signi ﬁ cantly lower levels of TC and LDL-C.  

This study had several strengths. First, to the best of our knowledge, we con ﬁ rmed the function of rs6690733 and rs12563308 in both lipid metabolism and susceptibility to IS. Second, using Quanto 1.2.4 software, we found our studies had  $94.1\%$   statistical power to detect such an association between rs6690733 and sus ce pti bility to IS. Third, the dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that the   $\mathrm{rs}6690733\mathrm{~C~}$   allele had lower levels of luciferase activity than the rs6690733 A allele. Several limitations remained in our study. First, Neyman bias might have been present. Second, potential selection bias for this hospital-based case – control study was unavoidable.  

# Conclusion  

Our study reveals that genetic variants of the  ANGPTL3 gene can contribute to susceptibility to IS in the Chinese population through participating in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Future exploration of the functional mechanism of the  ANGPTL3  gene and its biological function in lipid metabolism should be conducted to determine the etiology of IS.
