Background:  Ischemic injury is a common mechanism in both ischemic stroke (IS) and acute coronary syndrome  (ACS). Matrix metal lo protein as e 9 (MMP-9), an endo pep tid as e that degrades extracellular matrix, is important in  the pathogen es is of IS. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between the SNP rs17576 in MMP-9 gene with (1) the risk and severity of acute ischemic stroke in Saudi Arab individuals with recent acute cor­ onary syndrome, and (2) the risk of acute coronary syndrome in Saudi Arab individuals without ischemic stroke.  Methods:  A case control study of 200 IS patients, 520 ACS patients (without IS), and 500 aged-matched healthy  controls were genotyped to detect the MMP-9 polymorphism rs17156.  

Results:  Our study demonstrated a non-significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies of the MMP9  rs17576 polymorphism between the patients with IS and patients with ACS without IS   $(\mathbf{P}=0.31$   for the GA  genotype, 0.25 for the AA genotype and   $\tt P=0.20$   for the A allele). AA genotype was found to be statistically  significant between IS and control groups;   $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.84$  ,  $95~\%$   CI (1.08-3.14),   $p=\!0.015]$  . A allele showed a sig­ nificant difference between the two groups   $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.28$  ,   $95\ \%$   CI (1.00-1.64),  $p=\!0.028]$  . By comparing ACS  without IS and controls, AA genotype was significant   $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.46$  ,   $95~\%$   CI   $(1.01\small{-}2.12)$  ),  $p=\!0.029]$  . Stratification  by NIHSS score revealed higher mortality and early neurologic deterioration in IS patients with NIHSS score  $\geq16$   $(p<0.001$  , 0.044 respectively).  

Conclusion:  We deduced the lack of association either with allele or genotype frequencies   $\scriptstyle(\mathtt{p}>0.05)$   between the  IS cases and the cases of ACS without IS. In contrast there was a significant association of mutant genotype AA  between either the IS group or ACS (without IS) group, and the control group. In addition, different rs17576  genotypes were not associated with raised mortality or a tendency to develop early neurologic deterioration.  

# Introduction  

Stroke is still one of the most common causes of death globally. About  $80\,\%$   of strokes have an ischemic cause. The most common forms  of circulatory diseases these days are ischemic stroke (IS) and acute  coronary syndrome (ACS). Through the primary common mechanism of  atherosclerosis, both entities share etiologic aspects, path o physiology,  and risk factors. Logically, we find that many of the documented risk  factors are present in both conditions, even if their contribution to the  pathological event differs. Donnan et al. reviewed this fact, noting that  common identifiable risk factors explained  $90\,\%$   of ACS but only  $60\,\%$   of  IS. A prospective cohort study was conducted in Australia on 2805 men  and women aged 60 and up over 16 years, in which the authors identify  factors that predict both IS and ACS, while others predict only one of  

# each condition.  

The extracellular matrix (ECM) can be broken down by a broad  family of zinc-dependent enzymes called matrix metal lo protein as es  (MMPs), which also play a role in both healthy and diseased tissue  remodeling. MMP-9 is involved in a wide range of physiology and  path o physiology processes involving tissue remodeling, where it is  crucial for the degradation of extracellular matrix. MMP-9 is signifi­ cantly elevated in a number of cardiovascular conditions, such as ACS,  atherosclerosis, and hypertension. Studies showing the prognostic  power of MMP levels in predicting adverse events further emphasize the  central role of MMP-9 in patients with cardiovascular disease.  

Increased MMP-9 expression has been linked to some problems in  cerebral ischemia, including ex ci to toxicity, neuronal damage, apoptosis,  and the opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which causes cerebral  edema and hemorrhagic transformation. Numerous single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter, coding, and untranslated re­ gions of the human MMP-9 gene have been reported. MMP-9 poly­ morphisms have been linked to an increased risk of IS and carotid  atherosclerosis, according to several reports.  

Several previous studies have looked into the role of MMP-9 genetic  polymorphisms in stroke susceptibility, but the results have been  inconclusive. The purpose of the present original research was to eval­ uate the association between the SNP rs17576 in MMP-9 gene with 1)  the risk and severity of acute IS in Saudi Arab individuals with recent  ACS, and 2) the risk of ACS in Saudi Arab individuals without IS. The  severity of IS was evaluated by NHISS, early neurologic deterioration  (END), and mortality.  

# Materials and methods  

Study population  

We performed a case control design that recruited 200 IS patients  from Al-Noor Specialist Hospital and King Abdullah Medical City be­ tween 2019 and 2022, with a mean age of  $67.87\,\pm\,9.60$   years old. A  group of ACS without IS consisting of 520 individuals   $(66.25\,\pm\,8.21\$  years), comparable to the IS patients in terms of age and sex, were  recruited from the Cardiology Department during the same period. The  sample analyzed were non-related individuals. A group of 500 age and  sex-matched healthy controls, with no family history of ACS or IS events  were recruited from the blood donation unit in Al-Noor Specialist  Hospital.  

Those IS patients, who are newly diagnosed after a recent attack of  ACS within the last 2 months, were identified and diagnosed with IS by  at least two independent neurologists. In addition to standardized blood  tests, all patients received baseline brain computed tomography (CT)  scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on admission.  

Using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at  admission, the initial severity of an IS was determined. Based on their  NIHSS score, patients with IS (200 patients) were divided into two  subgroups. Patients that had NIHSS score of 16 or greater were labeled  with a moderate or severe stroke (59 patients), while patients who had  NIHSS score under 16 were labeled with a mild stroke (141 patients).  Previous research determined that an increase of four or more points in  the NIHSS within ten days of admission, excluding a new infarct in a  different vascular territory, was indicative of early neurologic deterio­ ration (END).  

Selection criteria  

The inclusion criteria of IS patients were acute IS (  ${\cdot}{\leq}48\;\mathrm{hr}$   of stroke  onset) patients with non val vu lar atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter  which was confirmed by common electrocardiogram (ECG) or   $_{24-\mathrm{hr}}$  Holter ECG during in-hospital. The non-inclusion criteria for IS patients  were: (a) a history of transient ischemic attack; (b) valvular AF or AF  with prosthetic heart valve; (c) IS caused by peripheral vascular disease,  other or unknown factors; (d) autoimmune disease, blood disease, se­ vere systemic disease or malignant tumors; and (e) refusal to take part in  this research.  

ACS without IS patients had a recent attack of ACS confirmed on  coronary angiography but with no cerebral ischemic complications. The  diagnosis of ACS and patient inclusion criteria are in accordance with  the criteria described in the relevant European Society of Cardiology  (ESC) guidelines. The key non-inclusion criteria were as follows:  bronchial asthma, any systemic connective tissue diseases, on co logical  pathology, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  

# Operational definitions  

Diabetes was diagnosed in accordance with ADA (2017) and hy­ pertension was defined as having a systolic pressure  ${>}130\,\mathrm{mm\,Hg}$   and a  diastolic pressure  $>80~\mathrm{mm~Hg}$   (stage 1) on multiple occasions. Dys­ lipidemia was defined as total cholesterol   $\mathrm{(TC)}\;>\;200\;\;\mathrm{mg/dl}$  , tri­ glycerides  $\mathrm{(TG)}>180\;\mathrm{m}g/\mathrm{d}\mathrm{l}$  , or the use of lipid-lowering medication. Patients who smoked over 10 cigarettes per day for five years were  considered smokers. The formula for calculating body mass index (BMI)  was to divide weight (in kilograms) by height (in square meters).  Moreover, BMI was calculated using the cut-off points of the WHO and  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) criteria. Mortality was tracked throughout the hospitalization period.  

Biochemical assays  

A venous blood sample was taken in amounts of 10 milliliters from  each enrolled subject in the study. The blood samples were taken within  the same hour of the day (8 am to   $2\ \sf{p m}$  ) to prevent variations in  circadian rhythm biochemical parameters. For DNA extraction, a blood  volume of   $5\,\mathrm{{ml}}$   in an EDTA tube was used. The serum was isolated from  the remaining   $5\;\mathrm{{ml}}$   of collected blood and placed in suitable tubes for  biochemical measurement of fasting glucose, lipids and cardiac markers.  The tests were carried out at KAMC and Al-Noor Specialist Hospital in  Makkah ’ s clinical chemistry laboratories.  

# Genotyping  

The EZ-10 Spin Column Whole Blood Genomic DNA Isolation Kit was  used to recover genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes (Ther­ moFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA) according to the manufac­ turer ’ s instructions. A DNA spectrophotometer was used to determine  the concentration of DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE,  USA). We select one MMP-9 SNP rs17576 based on previous studies. The selected MMP-9 SNP was genotyped using allele-specific TaqMan  genotyping probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA)  and   $100\;\mathrm{ng}$   of genomic DNA.  

Statistical analysis  

SPSS (Chicago, IL, United States) version 21 was used for all statis­ tical analyses. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality non parametric test  examines if quantitative variables are normally distributed. Quantitative  variables are displayed as the mean  $\pm$   standard deviation or median  $\pm$  interquartile range (IQR), while qualitative variables are expressed as  percentages.  

The sample size for this study was determined using the open-source  Epi version 6 (available at:  https://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/support/d  ownloads/previous/ei6.html ), a standard analysis tool for managing,  summarizing, and analyzing data. The calculation was based on a power  of   $80~\%$  , a   $95~\%$   confidence level.  

The SNP site, gender, smoking status, and hypertension were  examined using the  $\mathbf{x2}$   test. The quantitative variables were tested by the  independent samples t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. One-way  ANOVA was used to test the quantitative variables in different  genotypes, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine the  remaining non parametric characteristics. Fisher ’ s exact test was  employed to determine how the alleles were distributed between the  two groups. To determine the significance of the association between  SNPs and IS, a multi no mi al logistic regression analysis was performed.  Furthermore, the odds ratio (OR) and   $95~\%$   confidence intervals (CI)  were calculated. To determine whether genotype and allele frequencies  in two groups are balanced, the Hardy-Weinberg law is applied.  $p<0.05$  was used to indicate a statistically significant difference between the two  groups.  

Ethical considerations  

Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before  enrollment in the study. The procedure of the study was authorized by  the Institutional Review Board of the Ministry of Health, Makkah  Directorate.  

# Results  

The study recruited 200 IS patients (following an acute attack of  ACS), 520 ACS patients (without IS), and 500 aged-matched controls. IS  patient group was divided according to NIHSS at admission into 2  groups, with a cut-off of 16. The characteristics of the participants 

 ( Table 1 ) revealed equal distribution by age as the patients with NIHSS 

  $\geq16$   had mean age and standard deviation of   $(68.25\,\pm\,8.21)$  ) years  versus that of IS patients with NIHSS  ${<}16$  , patients with ACS without IS  and normal controls of   $(66.45\,\pm\,9.28)$  ,   $(62.45\pm11.2)$   and   $(63.29\ \pm$  8.23) years respectively; with a p-value of 0.098, 0.257 and 0.998  respectively.  

In addition, patients with   $\mathrm{{NHSS}~\geq~16}$   largely demonstrated  distinctive clinical characteristics compared to the controls in the  following parameters: body mass index   $(29.26\pm4.11)$   vs.   $(24.45\pm5.8)$   $\tt[p=\!0.043]$  , smoking status 28   $(47.46\;\%)$  ) vs. 112   $(22.4\;\%)$     $\tt[p=\!0.003]$  ,  exercise habits 3   $(5.08\,\%)$  ) vs. 118   $(23.8\,\%)$   $\mathbf{\tau}[\mathbf{p}\!=\!\!0.037]$  , diabetes mellitus  35   $(59.32\,\%)$  ) vs. 103   $(20.6\,\%)$   $[\mathbf{p}{<}0.001]$  , hypertension 41   $(69.49\,\%)$   vs.  110   $(22\;\%)$     $[\mathtt{p}\!<\!0.001]$  ].  

Furthermore, patients with   $\mathrm{NHSS}\,\geq\,16$   had higher fasting blood  glucose levels   $(7.9\pm0.78)$   mmol/L than the control group   $(6.14\pm0.4)$  mmol/L  $[\mathtt{p}\!<\!0.001]$  ]. The lipid profile revealed significant differences in  measured total cholesterol, LDL-c, triglycerides, and curiously the  seemingly protective HDL-c showed significant dissimilarity between

In addition, patients with   $\mathrm{NHSS}\geq16$   largely demonstrated more char­ act eris tics than controls in the following parameters: body mass index, smoking status, exercise habits, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and fasting blood glucose levels.  Furthermore, lipid profile revealed significant differences in measured total cholesterol, LDL-c, triglycerides and protective HDL-c patients and controls.

The IS subtypes revealed a significantly higher card i oem boli c ten­ dency of IS with  $\mathrm{NHSS}\geq16$  [  $\bullet=\!0.012]$  , while at hero thrombosis and  small artery disease were higher in the group with  $\mathrm{NHSS}<16$   but with  no significance  $\mathrm{{[p=}}0.07$   and 0.16 respectively] ( Table 2 ). The mortality  of moderate to severe IS with  $\mathrm{NHSS}\geq16$   was significantly higher in  comparison to the group with   $\mathrm{NHSS}<16$     $[\mathtt{p}\!<\!0.001]$  . The group with  moderate to severe IS with   $\mathrm{NHSS}\geq16$   showed a higher tendency to  develop END than the comparable group with NIHSS  <  16  $\tt[p=\!0.044]$  .  

The allelic discrimination was performed by RT-PCR and the analysis  plot is shown in  Fig. 1  (A is the mutant allele and G is the wild allele).  The genotype distribution ( Table 3 ) was in decreasing order GG, 93   $(46.5\;\%)$  , GA 86   $(43\,\%)$  ) and AA 21   $(10.5\,\%)$   in the IS patients while the  pattern in cases of ACS without IS was GG 225   $(43.3\ \%)$  , GA 231 (44.4 

  $\%$   and AA 64   $(12.3\ \%)$  ) and in control group was as follow, GG, 212 

  $(42.4~\%)$  , GA 200   $(40~\%)$   and AA 88   $(17.6\ \%)$  . No deviation from the  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the polymorphism examined was  observed in the genotype distributions of the IS patients, cases of ACS  without IS, and controls.  

Among the two genotypes of rs17565,  Table 3  shows that none were  statistically significant as the odd ’ s ratios between the cases of IS and  cases of ACS without IS were as follows: AA   $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.26$  ,   $95~\%$   CI (0.73-  2.18), $p=\!0.25]$  and GA  $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.11$ ,  $95~\%$  CI (0.79–1.57), $p=\!0.31]$ . Al­leles distribution among the two previous groups was more with G than  A, however, they were not statistically significant as the   $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.12$  , 95   $\%\mathrm{CI}$   (0.88-1.43),  $p=\!0.20]$  .  

When comparing IS and control groups, AA genotype was found to be  statistically significant in both separate and recessive model analysis; AA 

  $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.84$  ,  $95~\%$   CI (1.08 – 3.14),  $p=\!0.015]$   and in the recessive model 

  $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.82$  ,  $95\,\%$   CI (1.10 – 3.02),  $p\!=\!0.011]$  . A allele showed a significant  difference between the two groups   $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.28$  ,   $95~\%$   CI (1.00 – 1.64),  $p$   $\mathtt{=}0.028]$  . By comparing ACS without IS and controls, AA genotype was  significant in both separate and recessive model analysis AA   $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.46$  ,   $95~\%$   CI (1.01 – 2.12),  $p=\!0.029]$  ] and in the recessive model   $[\mathrm{OR}{=}1.52$  ,   $95~\%$   CI (1.07 – 2.16),  $p=\!0.011.$  ].  

The distribution of the genotype frequencies according to IS severity  was displayed ( Table 4 ) with no difference for NIHSS scaling   $(\geq$  or   $<$  16), presence of early neurologic deterioration, or mortality among  genotypes   $\mathbf{(p=}0.367$  , 0.152, and 0.092 respectively).  

Comparison of risk parameters across the genotypes ( Table 5 )  demonstrated statistical insignificance. Multivariate logistic regression  analysis of associated factors in IS patients ( Table 6 ) demonstrated the  insignificance of A Allele and other parameters.

# Discussion  

The present study aimed to evaluate the association between the SNP  rs17576 in MMP-9 gene with 1) the risk and severity of acute IS in Saudi  Arab individuals with recent ACS, and 2) the risk of ACS in Saudi Arab  individuals without IS. The severity of IS was evaluated by NHISS, END,  and mortality. The results of this study confirm the lack of association  either with allele or genotype frequencies   $\scriptstyle(\mathtt{p}>0.05)$  ) between the IS cases  and the cases of ACS without IS. While there was a significant associa­ tion of mutant genotype AA between either the IS group or ACS (without  IS) group, and the control group.  

ACS and IS are both common conditions with similar pathophysi­ ology based on arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis usually affects the pa­ tient all over, putting him at risk for both ACS and IS. In both cases, there  is a sudden change in circulation, resulting in decreased blood supply to  a portion of the heart or brain. Occasionally, IS has been like a "heart  attack" in the brain. As a result, data on epidemiology, risk and etio­ logical factors, and therapeutic measures are shared between ACS and  IS. Furthermore, some studies have shown that ACS is common among IS  patients. – 25

MMP-9 is a key enzyme for the ECM metabolism in many Central  Nervous System developmental and regenerative processes such as  neuro genesis, myelin formation, and axonal growth and regeneration.  MMP expression and activity are tightly regulated. To become activated,  most MMPs require pro teo ly tic processing by proteases or other MMPs  and can be inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metal lo protein as es (TIMPs).  Dys regulated MMP activity will result in uncontrolled degradation of  ECM and basal lamina proteins, which will have serious consequences  for BBB integrity as well as neuro inflammatory or neurotoxic effects. ,  27  

MMP dys regulation is known to occur after IS, leading to neuro­ vascular matrix degradation, disrupting cell-matrix homeostasis, and  weakening the BBB, all of which contribute to cell death, neuro toxicity,  edema, and hemorrhage. , MMP variation profiles in blood following  an event of IS suggest that these molecules may one day be used as  biomarkers for brain damage, while their contribution to tissue  destruction makes MMP inhibitors potentially interesting therapeutic  targets for IS. ,  

MMP-9 levels have been found to be elevated in both peripheral and  central cells following IS, including neurons, glia, endo the li al cells, and  neutrophils. , In non-human primates 33  rats 34  and mice 35  increased  expression of pro/active MMP-9 was detected within hours to days after  IS. Clinical studies have also shown that MMP-9 is elevated in the serum  of IS patients and is associated with a worsened outcome. , These  lines of evidence have led us to the conclusion that MMP-9 may play a  pathogenic role in IS.  

Several previous studies have looked into the role of MMP-9 genetic  polymorphisms in IS susceptibility, but the results have been inconclu­ sive. MMP-9   $\cdot1562\mathrm{~C/T}$   polymorphism was found to be significantly  associated with IS risk in the population studied by Bur a czy nsk a et al. and Zhang et al. According to Kaplan et al. MMP-9 haplotypes or  SNPs are not associated with ACS or stroke. Pollanen et al. confirmed the  link between the MMP-9 gene polymorphism -1562C/T and the insta­ bility and rupture of at hero sclerotic plaques.  

Our study located in the Western region of Saudi Arabia classified  200 IS patients according to NIHSS score at admission, into 2 groups.  Patients with an NIHSS score of 16 or higher were classified as having a  moderate or severe stroke. They were compared to 520 ACS patients 

 (without IS) and 500 aged-matched healthy controls.  

The frequencies of genotypes in our study (GG, 46.5; GA, 43 and AA, 

  $10.5\ \%$  ) were similar in these studies as Yi et al. recorded (GG, 53.8;  GA, 35.6 and AA,  $10.6\;\%$  ) while Li et  $\mathbf{a}\mathbf{l}^{43}$    reported slightly similar (GG,  58.9; GA, 35.9 and AA,  $5.2\,\%$  ). These studies proved the fact that MMP-9  polymorphism could not be used as an independent genetic risk factor  for IS.  

The group of moderate to severe IS with   $\mathrm{NHSS}\geq16$   showed higher  mortality   $(p<0.001)$  ) and a higher tendency to develop END than the  comparable group with   $\mathrm{NHSS}<16$  ,  $\mathtt{p=}0.044$  . Manso et al. found that  no SNP or haplotype in the MMP-9 gene was associated with stroke  outcome at three months in the ischemic subset.  

Yi et al. found that the incidence of moderate or severe stroke and  END was very common in IS patients with AF. MMP-9 polymorphisms  other than rs17576 were independently associated with severe stroke  and a higher risk of END, and pre-stroke anti thr ombo tic treatment was  associated with less severe stroke and a lower risk of END in patients  with AF.  

Despite the significant differences in lipid profile between cases and  controls, the MMP-9 rs17576 polymorphism did not exert an indepen­ dent vulnerability to the development of IS. Our study revealed insig­ nificant odd risk ratios among the haplotypes in both IS cases and ACS  cases without IS. The findings were similar to studies done among the  Southern Chinese population.  

We found that AA genotype and A allele showed a statistically sig­ nificant difference between the IS and control groups. In ACS without IS  and control groups, AA genotype was significant in both separate and  recessive model analysis.  

These studies proved the fact that MMP-9 polymorphism could not  be used as an independent genetic risk factor for IS in patients with  recent ACS in Saudi Arab populations. Both genetic and environmental  factors like HTN, diabetes, obesity, and smoking are important and main  risk factors for the development of IS and ACS.  

In North Africa, the polymorphisms assessed by restriction assay in   $184\,\mathrm{MI}$   patients and 180 healthy controls demonstrated that individuals  with the MMP-9-1562 T allele were more frequent in patients than in  controls   $[\mathrm{OR}=1.65$  ,   $95\,\%\mathrm{CI}\,1.09–2.15$  ,  $\tt{P=}0.011$  ). The frequency of CT   $+\,\mathrm{TT}$   genotypes was higher in patients with morbidity   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.85$  ,  $95\,\%$    CI 1.29 – 6.29,   $\mathrm{~P~}=\ 0.008)$   and with mortality   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,3.21\$  ,   $95\ \%{\mathrm{CI}}$    1.28 – 8.02,  $\tt{P}=0.012$  ) than in those without ACS complications.  

American research studied the p harm a co genetic associations of  MMP-9 and MMP-12 variants with ACS in patients with hypertension.  Participants having the MMP-9 R668Q minor allele homozygote (AA)  genotype had a lower risk of combined ACS when randomized to  chlo rtha li done versus amlodipine (Hazard Ratio  $=0.64.$  ). No significant  differences in ACS or combined ACS were observed across AG or GG  genotype-treatment groups. The P-value for the p harm a co genetic effect  of combined ACS in the recessive genetic model was 0.038.  

In an appraisal of the associations between six MMP-9 poly­ morphisms, Yi et  $\mathbf{a}\mathbf{l}^{42}$    showed that six variants of MMP-9 gene were not  associated with the risk of hemorrhagic transformations in acute IS with  at hero thrombosis, small artery disease, and card i oem boli c stroke using  single-locus analysis.  

A cohort of 1274 patients and 1258 age-matched healthy controls  were genotyped to detect the four MMP-9 polymorphisms (rs17156,  rs3787268, rs3918241, and rs3918242) using SNaPshot. MMP-9  rs3918242 polymorphism is linked to a higher risk of IS, confirming  the role of MMP-9 in the path o physiology of IS, with potentially  important therapeutic implications.  

The limitations of our study are; (i) we were unable to provide the  validation results (ii) Participants were ascertained from two hospitals  in the western region and (iii) we missed the plasma levels for MMP-9  through ELISA. Selection bias would have been difficult to avoid in a  multi-center study. Furthermore, the statistical power of the study could  be impacted because cost was a mitigating factor in ensuring a 1:3 case-control ratio.  

The originality of the present research lies in the exploration of  environmental and genetic risk factors in individuals with recent arterial  ischemia in two different territories (cerebral and myocardial). There  was a lack of association of rs17576 with ischemic stroke in adult in­ dividuals with acute coronary syndrome, even those with a moderate to  severe ischemic stroke onset. Also, there was a lack of association of  rs17576 with acute coronary syndrome in adult individuals without  ischemic stroke. In contrast, traditional cardiovascular risk factors were  associated with ischemic stroke and its severity in adults with acute  coronary syndrome, and in adults with acute coronary syndrome  without ischemic stroke. Because the mean age of the sample groups,  data suggest a higher influence of environmental risk factors than the  genetic one analyzed in MMP-9 gene for ischemic stroke regardless of its  severity and for acute coronary syndrome in adult Saudi Arab in­ dividuals. The clinical spectrum of cerebral and myocardial ischemic  diseases is wide, probably because of the diversity of interaction be­ tween risk factors, and the intensity and duration of exposition. Future  studies must evaluate more SNPs in different genes of the hemostatic  system and their phenotypic interactions.
