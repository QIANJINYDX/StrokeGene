Abstract:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS) are manifestations of  atherosclerosis, with a high death rate. miR-146a is a microRNA that participates in the  progress of CAD and IS. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the precursor of   miR-146a, rs2910164, was found to be associated with the risks of CAD and IS. However,  the results were inconsistent and inconclusive. A meta-analysis was performed to assess  the relationship of rs2910164 and CAD as well as IS susceptibility. The database Pubmed,  Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese National  Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)  were searched for related studies. Crude odds ratios with   $95\%$   confidence intervals were  used to investigate the strength of the association by random- or fixed-effect model. A total  of eight studies, with 3138 cases and 3097 controls were identified for the meta-analysis.  The results shows that rs2910164 is associated with the risk of CAD significantly in allelic  model   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.86)$  , homozygous model   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.70)$  ), heterozygous model   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.80)$  ) and  dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.76)$  ). The subjects carrying the GG genotype,   $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{GC}$   genotype  or   $\mathrm{G}$   allele are at lower risks of CAD. For the susceptibility of IS, there are no significant  

associations between rs2910164 and total studies. However, in subgroup analysis by sample  size and ethnicity, the GG,   $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{GC}$   and G allele of rs2910164 are found to be associated  with higher risks of IS in large sample size group and in Koreans, under homozygous and  dominant models. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis suggests lower risks of CAD for  GG,   $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{GC}$   genotype and G allele of rs2910164, while rs2910164 is not associated with  the risk of IS. Thus rs2910164 might be recommended as a predictor for susceptibility of  CAD, but not IS.

# 1. Introduction  

Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of death and disability worldwide. According to   the World Health Organization report in 2011, more than 17 million people died of cardiovascular   diseases. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is characterized by occlusive epicardial coronary artery  stenosis. Ischemic stroke (IS) is a major kind of stroke, which causes a high death rate and adult disability  in the world. According to the report of Liu, the annual stroke mortality rate was 120–180 per 100,000  in China [1]. In the United States, stroke ranks as the third leading cause of death [2]. IS has exceeded  heart diseases to become the most frequent cause of death. IS and CAD are principal clinical manifestations  of atherosclerosis, and have caused a huge burden for society. Previous studies demonstrated that single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with the risks of CAD and IS [3,4].  

MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs which regulate the gene expression in post-transcriptional  levels. The regulation effects of microRNAs are obtained by binding to the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of target mRNAs,  and lead to degradation or translation repression of target genes. Previous reports predicted that 1/3 of  human genes were regulated by microRNAs [5]. Thus, the microRNAs interfere with many ph y sio logic  and pathological processes. The changes in the sequences of microRNAs, such as single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs), may result in diseases.  

miR-146a is a microRNA located at the human chromosome 5q33. Previous studies have demonstrated  that miR-146a participates in inflammatory processes, thus interferes with the pathology of cardiovascular  diseases [6]. A SNP has been found to exist at the precursor miRNA-146a, which mutates G:U to C:U  and results in a low production of mature miR-146a [7]. Studies have reported the relationship between  miR-146a polymorphism and susceptibility of coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke. However,  the results are somehow inconsistent. For example, some studies demonstrated that miR-146a polymorphism  was associated with the risk of CAD and IS [8–12], while others thought it was not [13,14].  

Thus it is necessary to make a precise and comprehensive estimation of the association between   miR-146a and the risks of CAD and IS. In the present study, eight studies, including 3138 cases and  3097 controls, were included in the meta-analysis.  

# 2. Results  

# 2.1. Characteristics of Eligible Studies  

A total of 19 studies were obtained from the literature search after duplicates were removed. Among  them, three studies were excluded for irrelevance, two for being reviews, three for being master degree  theses and three were only abstracts. Finally, eight studies meeting the criteria were preserved, which  included 3138 cases and 3097 controls. The Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and   meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow chart is shown in Figure 1 and the information for the selected studies  was presented in Table 1.  

# 2.2. Results of Meta-Analysis  

The results of meta-analysis for the association between miR-146a (rs2910164) and CAD, IS risks  were shown in Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3.  

For CAD, significantly decreased risks were found to be associated with rs2910164 under all genetic  models, allelic model (  $)\mathbf{R}=0.86,\,95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=0.77–0.96,\,p=0.01)$  ), homozygous model   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.70$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.55{-}0.88$  ,   $p\,=\,0.003\$  ), heterozygous model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.80$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.65{-}0.98,$  ,   $p=0.03)$  ) and  dominant model   $\mathrm{DR}=0.76,\,95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=0.63–0.93,I$   $p=0.007]$  ). When we conducted a subgroup analysis  by sample size and ethnicity, the same significant associations were observed in the large sample size  group and the Chinese group. However, in the small sample size group, a significant decrease in CAD  risks was only found in the homozygous model.  

On the other hand, no significant association was found between rs2910164 and IS susceptibility in  the analysis as a whole. However, subgroup analysis by sample size indicated a significant association  between rs2910164 and IS susceptibility in large sample size groups and in Koreans, under homozygous  and dominant models (Table 2). No other evident associations between rs2910164 and risk of IS were  observed among subgroup analysis by Trial of Org 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST), gender,  smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyper lipid emi a in the dominant model (Table 3).

# 2.3. Sources of Heterogeneity  

For IS, the subgroup analysis indicated the sample size was the source of the heterogeneity among  studies   $(p=0.001\$   for allelic model;   $p=0.0006$   for homozygous model; and   $p=0.02$   for dominant  model) (data not shown). For CAD, there are no significant heterogeneity existing among all studies.  

# 2.4. Sensitivity Analysis  

The influence of each study on the pooled ORs and   $95\%$   CIs were evaluated by excluding one   single study at a time. The corresponding pooled OR was not significantly altered in all genetic models   (Figure 4).

# 2.5. Publication Bias  

We performed the Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s test to evaluate the publication bias. The  $p$    value  for Egger’s linear regression tests is shown in Table 4. As the results indicated, no obvious publication  bias was observed. And these results were also demonstrated by the shape of funnel plot (not shown).

# 3. Discussion  

The main findings of our meta-analysis show that rs2910164 is associated with the risk of CAD  significantly in allelic model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.86)$  , homozygous model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.70)$  , heterozygous model    $(\mathrm{OR}=0.80)$  ) and dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.76)$  . The subjects carrying GG genotype,   $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{GC}$   genotype  or G allele are at lower risks of CAD. For the susceptibility of IS, there are no significant associations  between rs2910164 and total studies. However, in subgroup analysis by sample size and ethnicity, the  

GG,  $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{GC}$   and G allele of rs2910164 are found to be associated with higher risks of IS in large size  group and in Koreans, under homozygous and dominant model.  

Although a very recent meta-analysis was performed to reveal the relationship of rs2910164 and  cardio-cerebro vascular diseases, He  et al.  [15], they included fewer studies on CAD and IS than those  in our meta-analysis. In our meta-analysis, we included two more studies, with 737 cases and 731  controls, for CAD and IS analysis. We further conducted a more comprehensive subgroup analysis for  IS by TOAST, gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyper lipid emi a. Furthermore, we  found some surprisingly different results between our meta-analysis and He  et al. ’s in CAD. Although  we found a similar lower CAD risks for G allele  vs.  C allele, our meta-analysis also demonstrated   a lower risks of CAD for GG/GC and GG genotype  vs.  CC carriers (Figure 2 and Table 2). However,  He  et al .’s meta-analysis stated a higher risk for GG carriers  vs.  CC carriers.  

In the sensitivity analysis, no significant changes were found after omitting each study one at a time,  indicating the relative stability and credibility of the results of our meta-analysis.  

We conducted a subgroup analysis by sample size and ethnicity, and observed that rs2910164 was  associated with the risks of CAD and IS in the large sample group. However, only one study was  included in the large size subgroup in CAD, and two studies were included in IS. We also found a higher  risk of IS in Korean for G allele, GG/GC and GG genotypes of miR-146a, and once again, only one  study is included in this subgroup. Thus, further studies are needed to confirm these results.  

Since no associations were found between rs2910164 and IS, we performed subgroup analysis by  TOAST, gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyper lipid emi a (Table 3). No significant  relations were found in all the analyses. But some studies lack sufficient data for the subgroup analysis.  For example, the study of Huang  et al . [11] lacks TOAST data, while Jeon  et al . and Zhu  et al . lack  gender, smoking, hypertension, hyper lipid emi a and diabetes mellitus data [12,16]. Interestingly, in the  study of Zhu  et al . [16], no significant correlations were found between rs2910164 and overall subjects,  though when they divided the patients to LAA and SVD according to TOAST typing, significantly  higher frequencies in LAA-caused IS were found in the CC genotype and C allele. However, the results  of Zhu  et al . [16], focusing on LAA-caused IS was contradictory to the study of Jeon  et al . [12]. This  may be the result of different target genes, geographical ethnic groups, sample size,  etc.  Further studies  are still needed to resolve this discrepancy.  

CAD and IS are both manifestations of atherosclerosis. Most studies included in the present   meta-analysis found dys lipid emi a in the case group. Previous studies have indicated atherosclerosis as  an inflammatory process. Thus, anti-inflammatory treatments decrease the risk of atherosclerosis. miR-146a  regulates the NF-κB-induced inflammatory process by targeting interleukin-1 receptor-associated   kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6). IRAK-1 and TRAF-6 are upstream  regulators of NF-κB activation, and major signal transducers of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) system [9].  The SNP in the pre-miR-146a changed the G to C allele, thus influence the mature miR-146a production,  and subsequently influence the inflammatory process of atherosclerosis. Interestingly, the GG,   $\mathrm{GG}+$    GC genotype and G allele are associated with lower susceptibility of CAD in overall subjects and large  sample size group. On the contrary, GG,  $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{GC}$   genotype and G allele are related to higher risk of IS  in large sample size group. This could be explained by the target gene selection of miR-146a and the  pathological differences of these two diseases [10,17–20]. Furthermore, the endo the li al dysfunction  induced by the inflammatory process is considered to be the first step of atherosclerosis. Further  

investigations are needed to reveal whether or not rs2910164 affects endo the li al mature miR-146a  production and the effects of this variation might have on endo the li al functions.  

The results of the present meta-analysis should be interpreted carefully because of the following  limitations. Firstly, the number of patients was relatively small, and may influence the outcomes. After  a very comprehensive literature search from several different databases, only a total of eight studies   were included in the present meta-analysis. Among them, four are related to CAD (1265 cases and   1241 controls) and four are related to IS (1873 cases and 1856 controls). The overall OR only indicated  the associations between rs2910164 and CAD. However, no associations were found between rs2910164  and IS risk. The second limitation is that the clinic o pathological characteristics or disease subtypes are  limited in most of these studies. Although we conducted subgroup analysis by clinic o pathological  characteristics in IS, only half of the included studies provide the necessary data. And for CAD, no such  characteristics were available. Thirdly, CAD and IS are both multi-factorial diseases influenced by   both genetic and environmental factors. The gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may play  important roles in the function of rs2910164, but most studies lack information about environmental  exposure and multiple SNPs in miRNA-encoding genes. The fourth limitation lies in the ethnicity of the  subjects. Most of the patients were Asians in the present study and this limited the general application  of the results to other populations.  

In conclusion, the current meta-analysis suggests a decreased risk of CAD for GG,  $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{GC}$   genotype  and G allele of rs2910164, while rs2910164 is not associated with the risk of IS. Thus rs2910164 might  be recommended as a predictor for susceptibility of CAD, but not IS. However, the results of this   meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity among study designs.  Further study is needed to evaluate the association of rs2910164 and these two diseases, especially in   a large sample size, in Caucasians, and with clinic o pathological characteristics.  

# 4. Methods  

# 4.1. Publication Search Strategy and Inclusion Criteria  

Published studies were systematically searched by Mei-hua Bao and Yan Xiao; the electronic  databases Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese  National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)   were searched for the following terms: “Coronary artery disease (CAD)” or “ischemic stroke (IS)” and  (“miR-146a” or “miRNA-146a” or “microRNA-146a”) and (“polymorphism” or “mutation” or “variant”  or “SNP” or “single nucleotide polymorphism”), without restriction on language. The deadline for  publication was 15 March, 2015. All the results from the databases were screened. First, we screened  the title. If the titles fulfilled our criteria, we then screened the abstract. We retrieved the full text if the  abstract was interesting. All eligible studies were retrieved manually for other potentially relevant studies  from their references. We contacted the authors for related data when they were unavailable in the  original publications.  

Inclusion Criteria: (a) Case-control design; (b) The association of miR-146a (rs2910164) and   CAD or IS risks should be evaluated; (c) The genotype in the control group should be agreed with the  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE); (d) The data in the publication are sufficient for present  

estimation. Studies were excluded if any of the following applies: (1) Repeat publications, abstracts,  letters or reviews; (2) Studies not meeting all of the inclusion criteria.  

# 4.2. Data Extraction  

We extracted the information from each eligible publication manually by two investigators  independently (Qing-song Zhang and Ji Luo). For each study, the extracted information included: First  authors’s name, year of publication, country, ethnicity, genotype method, sex ratio, age, source of  controls, diseases, genotype numbers of cases and controls. If we encountered discrepancies during data  extraction, it was resolved by a consensus achieved by the third author (Jian-ming Li).  

# 4.3. Quality Assessment  

The quality of the included studies was evaluated by the following aspects: source of cases, source of  controls, specimens used for determining genotypes, total sample size and evidence of HWE. The quality  scores ranged from 0–15, higher scores indicating better quality [21]. The quality evaluation was  performed by two authors independently (Juan Zhao and Guang-yi Li). Meetings were held to resolve  any discrepancies in the assessment process.  

# 4.4. Statistical Methods  

$\chi^{2}$  -test was used to evaluate the HWE of the control group polymorphism. If   $\textstyle p\,<\,0.05$  , it was  considered to be deviated from HWE. To evaluate the association between miR-146a (rs2910164) and  disease (CAD and IS) risk, the crude odds ratio (OR) with   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI) was used. The  pooled ORs were calculated using genetic model of allelic model (G  vs.  C), homozygous (GG  vs.  CC),  heterozygous (GC  vs.  CC) and dominant (GG/GC  vs.  CC) model, and the statistical significance was  determined by the  $Z$  -test, and  $p<0.05$   was considered to be statistically significant. Subgroup analysis  was conducted according to the sample size. Total samples less than 1000 was treated as small, and  otherwise as large.  

The statistical heterogeneity between studies was evaluated by  $\mathit{I}\cdot$  -square statistical test, which was not  dependent on the number of studies in the meta-analysis [22]. If there was an obvious heterogeneity  among the studies   $(\hat{I^{2}}>50\%)$  , the random-effects model (the Der Simoni an and Laird method) was   used for the meta-analysis [23]. Otherwise, the fixed-effect model using the Mantel-Haenszel method  was used [24]. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effects of individual study on pooled  results and the stability of results. The publication bias was detected with Begg’s funnel plot, and Egger’s  linear regression method, and  $p<0.05$   was considered to be statistically significant [25]. All statistical  analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and  Revman 5.3.
