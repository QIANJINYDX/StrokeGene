Abstract Cerebro vascular and cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. They are complex disorders resulting from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, and may share several susceptibility genes.Several recent studies have implicated variants of the Kalirin (KALRV) gene with susceptibility to cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes, but no studies have yet been performed in stroke patients. KALRN is involved, among others, in the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase,in the regulation of ischemic signal transduction, and in neuronal morphogenesis, plasticity, and stability. The goal of the present study was to determine whether SNPs in the KALRN region on 3q13, which includes the Ropporin gene mic stroke (IS) in a cohort trols. We genotyped 34 tag ROPN1 chromosomal regi unrelated controls, and perl 405 markers on chromos( marker association of the (rs4499545) in the ROPN1 two SNPs in KALRN (rs172 significant (  $(P<0.05)$  allelic adjusted for hypertension, association with IS risk. showed an association at  $P$
