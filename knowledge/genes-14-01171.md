Abstract:  HSPA8 is involved in many stroke-associated cellular processes, playing a pivotal role in the protein quality control system. Here we report the results of the pilot study aimed at determining whether  HSPA8  SNPs are linked to the risk of ischemic stroke (IS). DNA samples from 2139 Russians (888 IS patients and 1251 healthy controls) were genotyped for tagSNPs (rs1461496, rs10892958, and rs1136141) in the  HSPA8  gene using probe-based PCR. SNP rs10892958 of  HSPA8  was associated with an increased risk (risk allele G) of IS in smokers   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.37$   $1.37;\,95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.07{-}1.77;\,p=0.01)$  ) and patients with low fruit and vegetable consumption   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.36;95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=1.14{-}1.63;\,p=0.002)$  ). SNP rs1136141 of  HSPA8  was also associated with an increased risk of IS (risk allele A) exclusively in smokers   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.68$  ;    $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.23–2.28;$   $p=0.0007)$  ) and in patients with a low fruit and vegetable intake   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.29$  ;   $95\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=1.05{-}1.60;$     $p=0.04\$  ). Sex-stratiﬁed analysis revealed an association of rs10892958  HSPA8  with an increased risk of IS in males (risk allele G;  $\mathrm{OR}=1.30$  ;  $95\%$   CI = 1.05–1.61;  $p=0.01\$  ).  Thus, SNPs rs10892958 and rs1136141 in the  HSPA8  gene represent novel genetic markers of IS.

# 1. Introduction  

Ischemic stroke is the most frequent type of brain attack, the leading cause of death worldwide [ 1 ]. IS is considered a multi factorial disease due to the involvement of genetic and environmental factors [ 2 ]. A lot of studies have been done to evaluate the genetic nature of IS [ 3 – 7 ] and IS-related modiﬁable risk factors, like hypertension [ 8 , 9 ], atherosclerosis [ 10 , 11 ] , thrombosis [ 12 ]. However, disclosure of genetic correlates of IS remains an important task on the way to predicting and ﬁghting the disease.  

In ischemic conditions, a cell relies on multiple inter playing ensembles preserving macromolecules from degradation caused by oxygen deprivation, acidosis and oxidation.  

Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are a type of chaperones that are considered to be the most  Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are a type of chaperones that are considered to be the most conservative molecular machines providing homeostasis in ischemic conditions.

Accordingly, a large body of evidence has shown HSPs to be among the impactful players in response to ischemia as well as in recovering after ischemia-reperfumost impactful players in response to ischemia as well as in recovering after ischemiasion injury [14]. reperfusion injury [ 14 ].  

The  HSPA8 The  HSPA8  gene encodes a member of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family known as the heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70). HSP70 is known for its neuro protective protective functions [15–18], and as well as other members, HSP70 maintains cellular ho], and as well as other members, HSP70 maintains cellular homeostasis [ 19 ]. Precise roles of HSC70 include folding and transport of newly synthesised polypeptides polypeptides and assembly of protein complexes [20–22], regulation of mitochondrial im23 ], and port [23], and the ER-associated degradation quality control system [24]. According to our  ]. According to our knowledge, no knowledge, no research has looked into the relationship between   genetic variants and IS. Therefore, and IS. Therefore, the objective of our study was to challenge whether polymorphisms of   gene are  gene are related to IS risk.

Figure 1 depicts the research designʹs general layout.  

For the study, a total of 2139 unrelated Russians (888 IS patients and 1251 healthy Figure 1.  individuals) from Central Russia were enrolled. The study protocol was approved by the Kursk State Medical University’s Ethical Review Committee. All participants provided written informed consent prior to being accepted into the study, with the following inclusion requirements: self-declared Russian ancestry and a birthplace in Central Russia. Table  1 Kursk State Medical University s Ethical Review Committee. All participants provided  

The participants were enrolled in the study in two time periods: between 2010 and sion requirements: self-declared Russian ancestry and a birthplace in Central Russia. Table  ] and between 2015 and 2017 at the Regional Vascular Centre of Kursk Regional Clinical Hospital [ 26 ]. A team of qu ali cate d neurologists assessed each case. The diagnosis of IS during the acute phase of stroke was conﬁrmed using the ﬁndings of brain computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. The patients were recruited consecutively. Intra cerebral hemorrhage, he mo dynamic or dissection-related stroke, traumatic brain injury, hepatic or renal failure, autoimmune, on co logical, or other disorders that can produce an acute cerebro vascular event were considered exclusion criteria. All of the IS patients had a history of hypertension and were receiving anti hypertensive medications.

Statistically signiﬁcant differences between groups are indicated in bold; “-”— the characteristic is absent in healthy individuals; ND—no data.  

According to the WHO recommendations, low fruit and vegetable consumption was deﬁned as an intake of less than  $400\,\mathrm{g}$   per day. Normal consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits was deﬁned as an intake of   $400\,\mathrm{g}$   or more in 3–4 servings per day (excluding potatoes and other starchy tubers). [ 27 ]. The control group was made up of healthy volunteers with normal blood pressure who did not take anti hypertensive therapy and did not exhibit any clinical symptoms of cardiovascular, cerebro vascular, or other major diseases. Healthy persons were included in the control group if their systolic blood pressure was less than  $130\:\mathrm{mm\:Hg}$   and their diastolic blood pressure was less than  $85\;\mathrm{mm}\;\mathrm{Hg}$   on at least three different measurements. In the Kursk region, controls were chosen from the hospitals in Kursk during routine medical exams at public institutions and industrial businesses [ 28 , 29 ]. This group was recruited from the same population and during the same period.  

The following criteria were used to choose the SNPs: they had to be tagging, have a minor allele frequency of at least 0.05 in the European population, and be distinguished by a high regulatory potential. The bio in format ic tools LD TAG SNP Selection (TagSNP) and SNPinfo Web Server ( https://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/(accessed  on 15 March 2022)), which were utilised to choose SNPs based on the reference haplotypic structure of the Caucasian population (CEU) of the project HapMap, showed that the  HSPA8  (heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 8, ID: 3312) gene contains three tag SNPs (rs1461496, rs10892958, and rs1136141). SNPs rs1461496 and rs1136141 are located in the 3 prime UTRs; rs10892958 is located in the intron.  

Several bio in format ic approaches were used to examine the  HSPA8  tag SNPs’ regulatory potential. SNP FuncPred reports that the rs10892958 has a Regulatory Potential Score of 0.154 and the rs1136141 has a Regulatory Potential Score of 0.132 ( https: //snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/snpfunc.html  (accessed on 15 February 2023)) [ 30 ].  

The RegulomeDB instrument revealed that rs1461496 is characterized by a regulatory coefﬁcient of 3a (TF binding  $^+$   any motif  $^+$   DNase peak); rs10892958 and rs1136141 are characterized by a regulatory coefﬁcient of 4 (TF binding   $^+$   DNase peak) ( https: //regulomedb.org/regulome-search/  (accessed on 15 February 2023)) [ 31 ].  

According to the HaploReg (v4.1) database, these SNPs have properties such as enhancer histone tags in various tissues (rs1461496), regions of hypersensitivity for DNAse 1 (rs1461496, rs10892958, rs1136141), binding sites for regulatory proteins (rs10892958, rs1136141), and DNA regulatory motifs (rs10892958, rs1136141) ( http://archive.broad institute.org/mammals/ haploreg/haploreg.php  (accessed on 15 February 2023)) [ 32 ].  

According to information from the NCBI source ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ snp/  (accessed on 15 February 2023)), these genetic variants are identiﬁed by an average frequency of the minor alleles in European populations of  ${>}0.05$  . As a result, all three SNPs were chosen for our investigation, which satisﬁed the requirements for study inclusion.  

# 2.1. Genetic Analysis  

The Laboratory of Genomic Research at the Research Institute for Genetic and Molecular Epidemiology of Kursk State Medical University (Kursk, Russia) performed genotyping. Up to  $5\,\mathrm{mL}$   of venous blood from each participant was collected from a cubital vein, put into EDTA-coated tubes, and kept at    $-20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until it was processed. Defrosted blood samples were used to extract genomic DNA using the standard methods of phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purity, quality, and concentration of the extracted DNA solution were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA).  

Genotyping of the SNPs was done using allele-speciﬁc probe-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) according to the protocols designed in the Laboratory of Genomic Research. The Primer3 software was used for primer design [ 33 ]. Table S1 lists the primers and probes used for genotyping. A real-time PCR procedure was performed in a  $25\,\mathrm{mL}$   reaction solution containing 1.5 units of Hot Start Taq DNA polymerase (Biolabmix, Novosibirsk, Russia), approximately  $1\;\upmu\mathrm{g}$   of DNA,   $0.25\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$   each of the primers  $0.25\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$   each primer, 250  $\upmu\mathrm{M}$   dNTPs,  $3.0\;\mathrm{{mM}}\:\mathrm{{MgCl}}_{2}$   (for rs1136141 and rs1461496),  $4.5\,\mathrm{{mM}}\,\mathrm{{MgCl}}_{2}$   (for rs10892958);  

$1\!\times\!\mathrm{PCR}$   buffer (67 mM Tris-HCl,  $\mathrm{pH}\,8.8,$  ,   $16.6\:\mathrm{mM}$     $(\mathrm{NH_{4}})_{2}\mathrm{SO_{4}},$   $0.01\%$   Tween-20). The PCR procedure comprised an initial de natura tion for 10 minutes at 95  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  C, followed by 39 cycles of  $92\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\,\mathrm{s}$   and  $65\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  ,  $61.5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$   $51\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $1\,\mathrm{{min}}$   (for rs10892958, rs1136141 and rs1461496 respectively). Figures S1–S3 show allelic discrimination plots for  $H S P A8$   assays designed for this study.   $10\%$   of the DNA samples were genotyped twice, blinded to the case-control status, in order to assure quality control. Over  $99\%$   of the data were concordant.  

# 2.2. Statistical and Bio in format ic Analysis  

The statistical power for the study was determined using the genetic association study power calculator, a tool available online at  http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/gas_ power calculator/  (accessed on 16 February 2023). Given a sample size of 888 cases and 1251 controls, an association study between the  HSPA8  gene polymorphisms and IS risk might identify a genotype relative risk of 1.20–1.32 assuming 0.80 power and a  $5\%$   type I error (  $\alpha=0.05,$  ).  

The STATISTICA software (v13.3, Santa Clara, California, USA) was used to conduct all statistical analyses. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the distribution of quantitative data. The median (Me) and ﬁrst and third quartiles [Q1 and Q3] were used to express the biochemical parameters and body mass index because they deviated from the normal distribution. The Pearson’s chi-squared test with Yates’s continuity correction was used to determine the statistical sign i can ce of differences for categorical variables.  

Using Fisher’s exact test, the genotype distributions were evaluated for HardyWeinberg equilibrium compliance. Using the SNPStats software ( https://www.snpstats. net/start.htm  (accessed on 18 January 2023)), the genotype frequencies in the study groups and their relationships to disease risk were analyzed [ 34 ]. For the analysis of associations of genotypes, additive models were used. The associations of genotypes in the whole group of IS patients and controls were adjusted for age, gender, and smoking status. When the environmental risk factor in the control group was unknown, relationships were examined based on whether the risk factor was present or absent in the IS group relative to the entire control group. The Bonferroni correction was also used in this instance.  

The functional effects of  HSPA8  SNPs were examined using the bioinformatics resources listed below:  

• The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the brain, whole blood, and blood vessels have been evaluated using the bio in format ic tool QTLbase ( http://www. mulinlab.org/qtlbase/index.html  (accessed on 21 February 2023)) [ 35 ].

 • The STRING database’s bio in format ic tools were utilised to analyse the main functional partners of HSPA8 ( https://string-db.org/  (accessed on 21 February 2023)) [ 36 ]. Additionally, the STRING database was used to assess biological processes and molecular functions data describing interactions between HSPA8 and its functionally signiﬁcant partner proteins. For the interpretation of interactions only experimentally conﬁrmed data was used.

 • The effect of  HSPA8  SNPs on the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to DNA was assessed using the atSNP Function Prediction online tool ( http://atsnp.biostat.wisc. edu/search  (accessed on 21 February 2023)) [ 37 ]. Based on a positional weight matrixbased calculation of the impact of SNPs on how well TFs interact with DNA, certain TFs were added.

 • The online Gene Ontology tool was used to conduct the subsequent study of the potential joint involvement of TFs linked with the reference and SNP alleles in overrepresented biological processes that are related to the mechanisms of IS ( http: //gene ontology.org/  (accessed on 21 February 2023)) [ 38 ]. As functional groups, we employed biological processes governed by transcription factors connected to HSPA8  SNPs.

 • HaploReg (v4.1), a bioinformatics tool ( http://archive.broad institute.org/mammals/ haploreg/haploreg.php  (accessed on 20 February 2023)) was used to evaluate the the relationships between  HSPA8  SNPs and the following histone modi cations that  relationships between  HSPA8  SNPs and the following histone modi cations that mark mark promoters and enhancers: acetyl ation of the lysine residues at positions 27 and  promoters and enhancers: acetyl ation of the lysine residues at positions 27 and 9 9 of the histone H3 protein, as well as mono-methyl ation at position 4 of the histone  of the histone H3 protein, as well as mono-methyl ation at position 4 of the histone H3 protein (H3K4me1) and tri-methyl ation at position 4 of the histone H3 protein  H3 protein (H3K4me1) and tri-methyl ation at position 4 of the histone H3 protein (H3K4me3).

In the control group, the distribution of genotype frequencies for each of the investigated SNPs matched the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  $(p>0.05)$  . The observed he ter oz y gos it y for rs1136141 (0.2280) in IS patients, nonetheless, was lower than expected (0.2495);  $p<0.05$   (Table S4).  

There were no links between IS risk and HSPA8 SNPs in the analysis of the entire cohort (Table  2 ). Following sub-group analysis, it was revealed that rs10892958 was linked to a higher risk of IS only in males (risk allele G;  $\mathrm{OR}=1.30$  ;  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.05–1$  1.61;  $p=0.01$  ). The genetic variants rs10892958 (risk allele G;  $\mathrm{OR}=1.37$  ;   $95\%$   $,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.07–1.77$  ;    $p=0.01$  ) and rs1136141 (risk allele A;   $\mathrm{OR}=1.68$  ;  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.23–2.2$  8;    $p=7.0\times10^{-4})$  ) were associated with the development of IS only in smokers. It is noteworthy that the associations between rs10892958 (risk allele G;   $\mathrm{OR}=1.36,$   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.14–1.63$   $\dot{p}=9.0\times10^{-4}$   $\mathsf{P b o n f}=0.002)$  and rs1136141 (risk allele A; OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.05–1.60;  $p=0.02.$  ; Pbonf = 0.04) with IS risk were observed only under the condition of low fruit and vegetable intake (Table  2 ; Table S5).

SNPs rs10892958 and rs1136141 are located in the region of DNA binding to H3K4me1 in brain tissues (rs10892958), blood (rs10892958, rs1136141), as well as H3K4me3 in the brain tissues and blood (rs10892958, rs1136141). The effect of these histone tags is increased by the H3K27ac, marking enhancers in blood cells and all brain tissues (rs10892958, rs1136141), as well as the H3K9ac, marking promoters in blood cells and all brain tissues, except the Brain Hippocampus Middle (rs10892958, rs1136141). It is noteworthy that the SNPs rs10892958 and rs1136141 are also localized in DNA regions hypersensitive to DNase-1 in the blood (Table  4 ).

Moreover, using the resource HaploReg (v4.1), it was found that these SNPs are highly regulated by regulatory proteins: rs1136141 is located in the binding site DNA with 23 regulatory proteins: CMYC, ELF1, ELK4, GTF2B, GTF2F1, HEY1, MXI1, NELFE, NFKB, OCT2, P300, POL2, POL24H8, POL2B, POL2S2, POU2F2, SIN3AK20, TAF1, TAF7, TBP, TCF12, TCF4, YY1. SNP rs10892958 is localized at the DNA binding site with 6 regulatory proteins: CMYC, OCT2, POL2, POL24H8, POU2F2, TAF7.  

# 3.3.3. Analysis of Transcription Factors  

The risk allele G rs10892958 of  HSPA8  generates DNA binding sites for 31 TFs that are simultaneously implicated in 6 overrepresented GO regulating oxidative stress and neuro genesis: “regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to oxidative stress” (  $\mathrm{(GC)}=0043619$  ;   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.02$  ), “glial cell fate commitment” (  $(\mathrm{GC}=0021781,$  ;

  $\mathrm{FDR}=0.04$  ), “regulation of oli god end ro cyte differentiation” (  $(\mathrm{GC}=0048713$  ;   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.01$  ),

Meanwhile, protective allele C rs10892958  HSPA8 provides DNA binding regions for 53 TFs jointly involved in the regulation of pro a the ros clerotic mechanisms, in amma tion, cell signaling, neuro genesis, and apoptosis: “macrophage derived foam cell differentiation”   $(\mathrm{GC}=0010742)$  ;   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.0149)$  , “cellular response to transforming growth factor beta stimulus” (  $(\mathrm{GC}=0071560$  ;   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.02$  ), “cellular response to cytokine stimulus” (  $(\mathrm{GC}=0071345$  ;   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.008$  ), “negative regulation of interferon-beta production”   $(\mathrm{GC}=0032688)$  ;   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.035,$  ), “glial cell fate commitment” (  $(\mathrm{GC}=0021781)$  ;  $\mathrm{FDR}=0.03)$  ), and “regulation of apoptotic process” (  $(\mathrm{GC}=0042981$  ;  $\mathrm{FDR}=0.01$  ) (Table S6).  

Risk allele   $\mathrm{A},$  , rs1136141, of  HSPA8  creates DNA binding sites for 43 TFs, which together participate in 5 overrepresented GOs co-controlling “positive regulation of CD8- positive, alpha-beta T cell differentiation” (  $(\mathrm{GC}=0043378)$  ;   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.007$  ), “regulation of blood vessel endo the li al cell migration”   $(\mathrm{GC}=0043535$  ;   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.04)$  ), “positive regulation of ang io genesis”   $(\mathrm{GC}=0045766$  ;  $\mathrm{FDR}=0.02$  ), “response to growth factor”   $(\mathrm{GC}=0070848)$  ;  $\mathrm{FDR}=0.015,$  ), and “negative regulation of apoptotic process”   $({\mathrm{GO}}=0043066)$  ;   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.04$  . Meanwhile, no common GO was deﬁned for 19 TFs, binding with the protective allele G (Table S7).

# 4. Discussion  

Our study is the ﬁrst to show that  HSPA8  SNPs are associated with the risk and clinical features of IS, and this relationship is sign i cant ly modiﬁed by gender and environmental risk factors. SNP rs10892958 (risk allele G) was found to be associated with an increased risk of IS exclusively in males, smokers, and individuals with low fruit and vegetable consumption. SNP rs1136141 was associated with an increased risk of IS only in smokers and on the condition of in suf cie nt fruit and vegetable consumption.  

HSPA8 is a molecular chaperone highly expressed in vessels, brain tissues, and blood [ 19 , 41 – 43 ]. Bio in format ic analysis revealed that HSPA8 also interacts with other proteins that control the regulation of protein constancy, protein folding, refolding, response to unfolded proteins, regulation of protein ubiquitin ation, and cellular response to unfolded proteins. The possible sign i can ce of HSPA8 (HSC70) in the molecular mechanisms of ischemic stroke has already been noted in previous studies. For example, according to Bustamente et al., elevated serum HSC70 levels are typical of ischemic stroke compared to hemorrhagic stroke [ 44 ]. Stankowski et al. noted that the heat shock C-terminus related to 70 interacting proteins increases after stroke and impairs survival in acute oxidative stress [ 45 ]. Previous studies also demonstrated that vascular expression of  HSPA8  had been up-regulated in individuals with at hero sclerotic diseases, perhaps as a compensatory response [ 46 , 47 ]. HSPA8 was shown to interact with NLRC5 and suppress the NF-kB pathway [ 48 ] in macrophages, suggesting its role in vascular wall in amma tion [ 49 ]. Noteworthy is that apparently HSPA8 may also display pro thr ombo tic activities [ 50 ].  

The functional impacts of genetic variants were interpreted using a bio in format ic approach because there has not been any research investigating the association of  HSPA8 SNPs with IS risk up to this point. This approach made it possible to study the molecular mechanisms behind the involvement of  HSPA8  polymorphic loci in IS pathogen es is.  

Firstly, IS-linked SNPs are characterized by high regulatory potential: they sign i cant ly affect histone modi cations in brain and blood tissues, mainly tri methyl ation in the 4th lysine residue of histone H3 and acetyl ation of lysine residues in the N-terminal position 27 of histone; they are largely regulated by regulatory proteins.  

Secondly, according to bio in format ic resources, the risk alleles G rs10892958 and A rs1136141 have a relationship to cis-eQTL-mediated down-regulation of  HSPA8  in brain tissues. Allele A rs1136141 also affects an increase in  CLMP  expression in the brain. Probably, CLMP  plays a substantial role in the formation of cerebral atherosclerosis since it encodes a type I trans membrane protein that is found in junctional complexes between endo the li al and epithelial cells. This protein may also play a function in cell-cell adhesion [ 51 ].  

Thirdly, risk allele G rs10892958 and risk allele A rs1136141  HSPA8  produce DNA binding sites for TFs involved in oxidative stress, neuro genesis, ang io genesis, apoptosis, and migration of blood vessel endo the li al cells; this adds more support to the notion that HSPA8  plays a signiﬁcant role in the molecular mechanisms underlying IS.  

Fourth, information obtained with the bio in format ic tool CDKP revealed that the risk allele A rs1136141 is linked to a higher risk of cerebral stroke (TOAST other determined), increased level of systolic blood pressure, and an increased heart rate. As a result, this genetic variation may have a signiﬁcant impact on the development of hypertension, the main risk factor for IS. Atrial brillat ion, another key risk factor for the card i oem boli c type of IS, is also made more likely by a higher heart rate. Notably, CDKP data also indicates that the A allele rs1136141 has a role in risking peripheral artery disease in ever-smokers —a path o genetically related cardiovascular pathology. This ﬁnding correlates with the data obtained in our study, which provide proof of the involvement of this genetic variant in the formation of IS risk in smokers.  

On the other hand, HSPA8 may play a protective role in IS the process of ischemic stroke by protecting nerve cells and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis [ 52 – 54 ]. As a chaperone, HSPA8 orchestrates the folding and compartment aliz ation of the client proteins, contributing to the cellular stress response [ 55 , 56 ]. HSPA8 also down-regulates apoptotic cell death, both via direct suppression of several members of the apoptotic pathway and via activation of the anti-death protein bcl-2 [ 56 ]. Additionally, HSP70s have been shown to be critical for the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles, participating in neurological recovery after stroke [ 57 ]. Moreover, HSPA8 is considered a negative regulator of oxidative stress. Some authors revealed that constitutive ly expressed HSPA8 plays a role in protecting car dio myo cyte s from oxidative damage, increasing cell survival [ 58 , 59 ]. Finally,  Hspa1a/ Hspa1b  knock-out mice subjected to different thrombotic challenges developed thrombosis sign i cant ly earlier than their wild-type counterparts, suggesting the important role of members of HSP70 family in regulation of hae most as is [ 60 ]. More recent studies have reported that HSPA8 is released from car dio myo cyte s under oxidative stress [ 61 ]. Altogether, these data indicate that HSPA8 may take an important place during the cellular response to ischemia, and future research should address its role in the course of IS.  

In our study, we also revealed sex-speciﬁc correlates of  HSPA8  genetic variants. Numerous proofs are presented in the literature that candidate genes for cardiovascular diseases are characterized by pronounced gender-speciﬁc effects in the manifestation of associations [ 62 – 66 ]. The association of rs10892958 with the development of IS in men found in our study is explained by the regulation of  HSPA8  expression by sex hormones. There is a lot of evidence that estradiol increases the expression of  HSPA8  [ 67 – 71 ]. Considering that the carriage of the G rs10892958 allele is associated with  HSPA8  down-regulation, the absence of a compensating effect of estrogens on the  HSPA8  mRNA level increases the risk effects of this genetic variant. In addition, it has been found that in women,  HSPA8  levels are inversely correlated with the level of Toll-like receptor 4, which triggers oxidative stress and in amma tion, which are key elements of vascular diseases [ 72 ]. At the same time, no such correlation has been found in men.  

In the present research, we also report environmentally-dependent effects of  HSPA8 polymorphisms. It is known that environmental risk factors can modify the contribution of genetic variants on the risk of diseases [ 28 , 73 , 74 ]. Our study provided signiﬁcant evidence of the role of smoking and low consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits in the manifestation of associations rs10892958 and rs1136141  HSPA8  and the development of IS. It is noteworthy that both of these risk factors are associated with high levels of reactive oxygen species [ 75 , 76 ] and, accordingly, oxidative stress, a major link contributing to the development of cardiovascular disorders [ 25 , 77 – 79 ]. Smoking-speciﬁc correlates of candidate genes with risk of IS and stroke-related phenotypes have been demonstrated in many of our prior investigations [ 65 , 80 ], suggesting a signiﬁcant role for smoking-induced endo the li al dysfunction, vascular tone disorders, and atherosclerosis in the development of IS. The Comparative To xi genomics Database offered proof of smoking’s effects on the reduction of  HSPA8  expression [ 81 ] as well as accelerating the metabolism of HSPA8 protein [ 82 ]. Thus, most likely, smoking exacerbates the effect of IS-related alleles on the risk of disease by down-regulating  HSPA8  expression.  

In addition to smoking, low fruit and vegetable intake is linked to high levels of reactive oxygen species, in particular hydro peroxides [ 83 , 84 ], and increased consumption of antioxidant-rich foods may have prompted a decrease in the total amount of lipid peroxide [ 85 ].  In vitro  research demonstrates that poly phenol s, which are rich in fresh vegetables and fruits, shield arteries and neural cells from the toxicity of oxidative glutamate and  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   [ 86 , 87 ]. Many poly phenol s have strong anti-in amma tory activities in addition to their anti-oxidant characteristics [ 88 ]. The conducted studies have shown that hydrogen peroxide may affect the level of  HSPA8  mRNA [ 89 ], resulting in decreased expression of the HSPA8 protein [ 90 ]. Thus, low fresh fruit and vegetable consumption related to oxidative stress and high levels of reactive oxygen species may affect the decrease in  HSPA8 expression, thereby showing more pronounced effects of the risk alleles rs10892958 and rs1136141  HSPA8 .  

In conclusion, the results of our case-control study indicate that susceptibility to IS may be determined by genetic variants in  HSPA8 . However, we examined only tagSNPs and excluded from the analysis SNPs that are in linkage d is equilibrium with tagSNPs, which can lead to false-positive results since the relationships we identiﬁed may reﬂect the effects of genetic variants linked to analysed SNPs. This is a limitation of our study. Further research is needed to conﬁrm our ﬁndings and explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying the associations between IS risk and polymorphisms in the  HSPA8  gene.
