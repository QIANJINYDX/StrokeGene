Abstract:  Objective: 5-lip oxygen as e-activating protein gene ( ALOX5AP ) has been recognized as a susceptibility gene  for stroke. In this work, we explored the association of 6  ALOX5AP  SNPs with cerebral infarction (CI) in a northeastern Chinese Han population, using a case-control design. Methods: A group of patients with cerebral infarction were  randomly chosen as case group in northeastern Chinese Han population. Another comparative group of individuals without stroke were chosen as the control group. By utilizing TaqMan probe based real-time fluorescent PCR  and DNA sequencing method, this study focused on 6 SNPs of  ALOX5AP  gene and analyzed the association with  the hereditary susceptibility of cerebral infarction. Results: We found that, the rs9579646 G allele frequency was  significantly associated with higher ischemic cerebral infarction. There was no significant difference of rs9551963,  rs9315050, rs4769874, rs10507391 and rs4147064 genotype frequencies between the case and control group.  Haplotype-based association analysis of the block involving rs9579646 and rs10507391 revealed that the increased risk of stroke was significantly associated with haplotype GT and GA. Conclusion: These results suggested  that the genetic variants in  $A L O X5A P$   might be related to the risk of stroke in northeastern Chinese Han population.  The SNP rs9579646 may be a diagnostic index of cerebral infarction.

# Introduction  

Ischemic cerebral vascular diseases (ICVDs)  are common diseases of the nervous system,  and the leading causes of disability and death  in developed countries [1]. ICVDs have become  one of the three major causes of human death  currently. Complex environmental factors and  genetic background play an important role in  the occurrence and development of ICVDs.  

A number of different pathogenic events may  lead to ICVDs, including atherosclerosis, small  vessel disease, cardiac arrhythmia s, and hypercoagulation [2]. At hero thrombosis is considered to be the main cause [3]. Previous studies  had established age, sex, obesity, smoking,  hypertension, diabetes, and dys lipid emi a as  reliable stroke risk predictors [4]. Recent studies found that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including stroke [5]. A metaanalysis reported patients with T2DM had 2.27  times higher risk for ischemic stroke [5]. Given  the rising prevalence of T2DM due to the epidemic of obesity, the number of patients suffering cerebral diseases due to T2DM is expected  to further increase [6]. However, the molecular  association between diabetes and ICVDs are  unrevealed.  

In addition, these conventional risk factors do  not fully account for the overall risk of stroke.  Evidences from twins, family, and animal studies have consistently suggested a genetic contribution to the risk of ischemic stroke [7].  Although the detailed genetic mechanism of  ICVDs remains unclear, studies on gene polymorphism in diabetes or cerebral infarction  have reported several potential pathogenic factors. The De Code study highlighted the implication of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  

Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Me-dical University (Harbin, Heilongjiang,  China) between January 2013 and Fe-bruary 2014 and include in the case  group. Among the cases, 165 patients  were diagnosed with type 2 diabetic  mellitus according to the 1997 Ameri-can Diabetes Association criteria [12].  Patients complicated with hypertensi-on, blood diseases, tumor, thyroid diseases, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral  embolism, and cerebral infarction indu-ced by infection and severe liver and  kidney diseases were excluded in this  study.

We also recruited unrelated individuals as controls from the Health Medical Center of the  Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical  University. The control group composed of 452  individuals who were not related to the case  group and had no history of cerebral infarction  or transient ischemic attack. The first and second degree relatives of the controls had no  cerebro vascular diseases or hypertension. All  blood samples were collected following infor-med written consent of the participating indi- viduals and the study protocol was approved by  the institutional ethics committee.  

and haplotypes in the 5-lip oxygen as e-activating protein gene ( ALOX5AP  or  FLAP ) in ische-  mic stroke in the Icelandic population through  genome-wide linkage scan [8, 9].  ALOX5AP   encodes ara chi donate 5-lip oxygen as e-activating protein, which plays a key role in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory leu kotri ene B mediators, providing a potential link between infla-mmation and cardiovascular disease. The SNPs  of  ALOX5AP  have been a research focus in st-udies of ICVD populations. In 2012, we investigated the association of the SNPs of  ALOX5AP   with stroke in the Han population in northea-stern China. The rs9579646 GG genotype of  ALOX5AP  was found to be associated with a  marginally decreased risk for stroke [OR   $\langle95\%$     $\mathsf{C}\mathsf{I})\,=\,\bot.73$   (1.01-2.97)], compared with the AA  genotype [10]. Since the number of patients  with ischemic stroke was not large enough, we  investigated 6 SNPs across  ALOX5AP  sequence  in a larger number of stroke patients and ma-tched controls from northeastern China, as pa-rt of our ongoing hospital-based case-control  study.  

All experiments were performed in compliance  with the relevant laws and institutional guidelines. Informed consent was obtained from all  the subjects.  

# Genotyping  

Peripheral venous blood was withdrawn from  each subject for genotyping of  ALOX5AP . Ge-nomic DNA was extracted using standard phenol-chloroform protocols. The genotyping was  based on TaqMan ®  SNP Genotyping Assays  (Applied Biosystems). The primers and probes  were synthesized by Gene Tech (Shanghai) and  Applied Biosystems (ABI). For PCR, the reaction  mixture included the following: 20 ng genome  DNA   $(2.25~\mathsf{\mu L})$  ,   $2.5~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   TaqMan Universal PCR  Master Mix   $(2\times)$  , and   $0.25~\upmu\mathsf{L}$   SNP Genotyping  Assay stock   $(\varOmega\times)$  . The reaction volume a total  of   $5~{\upmu\mathrm{L}}$   each well was loaded into 384-well  plates for PCR. Amplification cycle was as follows: pre-de natura tion at   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for 10 min,  de natura tion at   $92^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $\tt L5\ \mathrm{s}$  , annealing and  extension at   $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 1 min. The total reaction  had 60 cycles and was carried out in an ABI  9700 PCR instrument.  

# Subjects and methods  

Subjects  

A total of 456 patients with unrelated ischemic  cerebral infarction of the northeastern Chinese  Han population were included in this study and  were taken as the case group. All cases were  diagnosed using the Fourth edition of Cereb-rovascular Disease Diagnostic Standards [11].  These patients have lived in the northeastern  provinces of China for more than 3 generations,  with no genetic relationship. The patients were  enrolled in the department of neurology of the  

and their  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) were also calculated  using the R Project. HardyWeinberg equilibrium tests to  evaluate the genotype distributions were performed with the  R package “genetics” (version  1.3.8.1, http://CRAN.R-project. org/package   $=$  genetics). A   $P$  value of less than 0.05 was  considered to be statistically  significant. The D’ (D-Prime) me-asurement was used to de-termine linkage d is equilibrium  (LD) with the software Haplo-view 4.2.

# Results  

# Clinical characteristics of  cases and controls  

In this work, we collected the  clinical data and blood samples of 456 patients with unrelated ischemic cerebral infarc- tion in total, which are classified  as the case group. 452 individuals without ischemic cerebral  infarction were also included in  this work as the control group.  The clinical characteristics of  cases and controls are presented in  Table 1 . Briefly, the  mean age was   $59.7\ \pm\ 11.5$    years for the cases and   $53.7\ \pm$  8.2 years for the controls (me-an   $\pm$  standard deviation,   ${^{***}P}$   $<0.00\varSigma,$  ). As diabetic and ICVD  patients, cases had a higher  triglyceride level (TG,   $^{**}\!{\cal P}^{\;<}$  0.001) and a lower level of high  density lipoprotein-cholesterol  (HDL-C,   $***P<0.001,$  ). The differences also exist in total cholesterol (TC,    $***P\ \ <\ \ 0.001)$

a Fisher’s exact test was performed.  

ALOX5AP . All the allele distributions of  ALOX5AP  SNPs we-re consistent with the HardyWeinberg equilibrium model  ( Table 2 ,  $P>0.05,$  ). No signifi- cant difference of the 6 SNPs  was found in allele frequencies among the cases and co-ntrols, which suggests a good  representation of the popu-lation.  

The allele and genotype dis-tribution of 6 SNPs of  ALOX5-   $A P$   was summarized in  Tables  3  and  4 . The frequencies of  rs9579646 SNP allele A and  G were significantly different  between ischemic stroke pa-tients and the controls ( Table  3 ,   $^{\star}P=0.014<0.05$  ).  

We also calculated the genotype distributions of   $A L O X5A P$  SNPs in the case and the control groups ( Table 4 ). The persons with a genotype of rs-9579646 GG had higher risks  of developing a cerebral in-farction than individuals with  other genotype [rs9579646  GG: OR   $(95\%~{\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{I}})=1.72$   (1.15- 2.55),   $^{\star}P=0.010<0.05$  ]. The  individuals with a genotype of  rs9579646 AG were also positively associated with cerebral  infarction [OR   $(95\%\,{\sf C I})=1.48$   

 (1.02-2.16)], with a  $P$  value of 

 0.050. No significant difference was found in the other  SNP genotypes ( Table 4 ).  

We performed stratification  analysis according to sex, age  and diabetes, and found that  there was no significant association of rs9579646 with is-chemic stroke risk in females  ( Table 5 ,   $P=0.472$  ). The frequency of rs9579646 GG had  a marginal    $P$  value between  males of the two groups (  $\prime P=$    0.060). In individuals under  60, rs9579646 GG was positively associated with cerebral

Figure 1.  LD structure of the  ALOX5AP  gene. The results of linkage d is equilibrium tests were generated  by Haploview 4.2 from the genotype of  ALOX5AP   polymorphisms. Linkage was found to be significant  between rs9579646 vs. rs10507391, rs4147064  vs. rs9551963, and rs4769874 vs. rs9315050 (  $\mathsf{\Gamma}\mathsf{D}^{\prime}=$  0.933,  $\mathsf{D}^{\prime}=\bot0$   and  $\mathsf{D}^{\prime}=\bot0$   respectively).  

infarction [ Table 5 ,   $^{**}\!P\,=\,0.007\,<\,0.01$  , OR   $(95\%\,\mathsf{C l})=2.07$   (1.24-3.46)]. Moreover, individuals with a genotype of rs9579646 GG had  higher risks of developing cerebral infarction,  who were not diabetics [ Table 5 ,   $^{*}P=0.047<$  0.05, OR   $(95\%~{\mathsf{C l}})=1.63$   (1.03-2.58)]. No significant association of rs9579646 GG with  cerebral infarction in patients with diabetes (  $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{{}P}}$   $=0.181)$  ) was found, which may be due to the  small sample size of diabetics in the control  group   $(\mathsf{n}=2\bot)$  ).  

For further analysis, we performed the haplotype distribution tests. Using Haploview 4.2, we  found that there were significant linkages be-tween rs9579646 vs. rs10507391, rs4147064  vs. rs9551963, and rs4769874 vs. rs9315050  ( Figure 1 ,   $\mathsf{D}^{\prime}\,=\,0.933$  ,   $\mathsf{D}^{\prime}\,=\,\bot.0$   and   $\mathsf{D}^{\prime}\,=\,\bot.0$  respectively). The haplotype distribution in the  case and control groups is shown in  Table 6 .  Only haplotypes with estimated frequency  $>\bot\%$  were represented. Patients with haplotype  rs9579646 & rs10507391 GT or GA had higher  risks to have ischemic stroke than haplotype  rs9579646 & rs10507391 AA   $[0\mathsf{R}\ =\ \bot.54$  (1.08-2.18),   $^{*}P=0.021<0.05$  , and   $\mathsf{O R}=4.07\$  (1.71-9.72),   $***P=0.002<0.01$  , respectively].  

# Discussion  

In this work, we selected 6 SNPs of  ALOX5AP  in  a northeastern Chinese Han population to  investigate their associations with the risk of  stroke. The cases and controls were stratified  into subgroups according to sex, age and diabetes to evaluate the correlation of   $A L O X5A P$  SNPs with cerebral infarction in patients. We  found that the rs9579646 GG genotype was  associated with a significantly increased risk of  stroke, compared with the rs9579646 AA genotype. Our findings indicate that the G allele in  rs9579646 is markedly increased in cerebral  infarction patients in comparison to control  subjects of Han ancestry in northeastern China.  Furthermore, the rs9579646 GG genotype was  also associated with elevated risk of stroke in  patients under 60. Together, these findings  suggested that these two sequence variants in  ALOX5AP  gene might be linked to the risk of  stroke in northeastern Chinese Han population. Patients without diabetes who carried  rs9579646 GG genotype were more susceptible to suffer cerebral infarction. We did not find  significant association of rs9579646 GG with  risk of stroke in diabetic patients, which may be  due to the small sample size of diabetics in the  control group.  

The SNP rs9579646 is an intron variant on  chromosome 13 of  Homo sapiens , and the  detailed mechanism of rs9579646 regulating  gene function remains unknown. In 2007,  Kaushal R et al reported that rs9579646 were  found to be significantly associated at both  allelic and genotypic level with ischemic stroke  among USA whites but not blacks [13], which  suggests the associations of rs9579646 with  stroke differ among populations. In 2011,  Zhang et al showed that the rs9579646 AG  genotype was associated with a marginally  decreased risk for stroke compared with the AA  genotype [14]. The subjects assessed in this  work were recruited from Jiangsu province, and  from an eastern Chinese Han population. In  Zhang’s follow-up study, they found rs9579-  646 AG genotype significantly decreases the  risk of stroke in male subjects, but not in female  or total subjects [15]. However, in our previous  study in 2012, we found that rs9579646 G  mutation associated with higher risk of stroke  [10], which is inconsistent with Zhang’s report.  Thus we enlarged the sample size of subjects  

[8].  ALOX5AP  encodes 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein [17],  which is required for the synt-hesis of leu kotri ene s [18-20].  Through encoding 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein,  ALOX5AP   plays a role in the initiation and  development of inflammation  and atherosclerosis. 5-lipoxyge-nase pathway has been demonstrated elevated in the artery  wall of patients with atherosclerosis [21, 22], which induces  vascular erosion by inflammatory factors and formation of lipid  plaque in the disease area.

![](images/572c6011e2ba80e6126ccffb01d7e3853707164a4a129972ecfdbb26f5bc0011.jpg)  
HapA: rs9579646 & rs10507391; HapB: rs4147064 & rs9551963; HapC:  rs4769874 & rs9315050.  

It was reported that variants of  ALOX5AP  are  involved in the pathogen es is of both myocardial infarction and stroke by increasing leukotriene production and inflammation in the arterial  wall [8]. A study of 639 consecutive stroke  patients and 736 unrelated population-based  controls suggested that sequence variants in  the  ALOX5AP  gene are significantly associated  with stroke in in a central European population  of stroke patients, particularly in males [23].  The  ALOX5AP  SG13S114 variant was report-ed as an independent risk factor for IS in   the Iberian population and is associated with  ALOX5AP  expression levels [9]. Recent work  demonstrated that the SNPs of  ALOX5AP  gene  have associations with ischemic stroke, particularly in the case a the roth rom bot ic stroke.  However, the precise mechanism of  ALOX5AP   variants contributing to the risk of stroke is still  unclear. It is possible that the SNP mutation  affects the transcriptional process and the  gene regulation in other areas such as the promoter region influence the level of the  ALOX5AP   gene transcription regulation. The role of this  gene in stroke merits further investigation.  

and the results were consistent with our previous reports in 2012. Meanwhile, Merhi M et al  reported that the genetic variant rs9579646 G  is significantly associated with a increased risk  of CAD in 2015 among Lebanese patients [16],  which is consistent with our findings. The underlying reason of this difference is unknown, but  might be due to different populations, sampling  strategies, or phenotype hetero-geneity. The  minor allele of rs9579646 among whites was  the major allele among blacks (G allele: whites   $=0.34$  , blacks  $=0.75.$  ) [13]. Merhi M et al con- sidered that the rs9579646  $\mathsf{G}>\mathsf{A}$   variant may  lead to a decreased expression of the  ALOX5AP   gene and its gene product FLAP, diminishing  the drastic effects of the leu kotri ene pathway  [16]. There could be linkage d is equilibrium (LD)  between rs9579646 and different functional  SNPs in the  ALOX5AP  gene, which leads to  up regulation of the leu kotri ene pathway in no-rtheastern Chinese Han population and downregulation in eastern Chinese Han population.  More work is needed to investigate this.  

It is known that cerebral infarction is a group of  polygenic diseases, affected by the interaction  of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic  variation is the molecular basis for human  genetic diversity and also the genetic susceptibility of cerebral infarction. In recent years,  some ischemic stroke (IS) related genes were  found through genome-wide linkage analysis,  such as  PED4D  and  ALOX5AP .  ALOX5AP  was  found associated with a greater risk of myocardial infarction in Iceland by a genome-wide  scan of 296 multiplex Icelandic families including 713 individuals with myocardial infarction  

# Conclusion  

In conclusion, this work suggested that the  ALOX5AP  rs9579646 G polymorphism variant  has associations with cerebral infarction risk  within a northeastern Chinese population. The  relation between  ALOX5AP  SNPs and stroke  remains unclear. More studies should be carried out to explore the detailed mechanisms by  which  ALOX5AP  polymorphism variants incre-ase susceptibility to cerebral infarction.
