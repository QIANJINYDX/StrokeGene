Background:  Ischemic stroke (IS) was a multi factorial disease, which was the main cause of death and adult disability. Genetic  factors cannot be ignored.  

Objective:  The present study discussed the relationship between  MMP17  variants and the susceptibility of IS.  

Methods:  Based on the Agena MassARRAY platform, we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the  MMP17  gene in  1345 participants (670 controls and 675 cases). We used logistic regression analysis to analyze the association of  MMP17  SNPs with  the risk of IS in the Chinese population, with odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs). False-positive report probability  (FPRP) detected false positives on the significant results. Besides, we detected the SNP–SNP interaction to predict IS risk by multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis.  

Results:  In the total analysis,  MMP17  rs7975920 conferred an increased susceptibility to IS. After a stratified analysis by age and  gender, the significant association between rs7975920 and IS risk was displayed in the subjects aged  ${>}55$   years old and females. After  stratified analysis by smoking and drinking,  MMP17  rs6598163 was related to the risk of IS in smokers and rs7975920 was associated  with the risk of IS in smokers and was in correlation with IS risk in drinkers.  

Conclusion:  In short, we first observed that  MMP17  rs7975920 and rs6598163 were related to the risk of IS. The above results  provided a theoretical basis for the elaboration of the role of MMP17 in IS in the Chinese population.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a multi factorial disease that is considered to be the leading cause of adult death and disability in many countries.  About  $85\%$   of stroke patients are due to ischemia. In the United States, it is one of the fifth deadliest diseases. According  to the statistics of stroke data in 2016, from 2009 to 2012, the number of people over 20 years old reached 6.6 million. The prevalence of the disease increases with age. In the latest report on the American Heart Association in 2020, that  number was expected to reach 7 million. In China, the incidence rate of this disease is also increasing year by year,  which has caused a certain degree of economic and mental burden to the country and the patients’ family. In 2013, some  researchers conducted a survey in 155 urban regions and rural centers in 31 provinces, with a total of 480,687 adults aged   ${\geq}20$   years old. Of these, 7672 people (4217 males and 3455 females) were diagnosed with mild stroke (1596/100,000)  and 1643 people (903 males and 740 females) with sudden stroke (345.1/100,000). Areas with high incidence of IS were  most prominent in the northern and central regions. Therefore, it is urgent to explore the pathogenic factors of IS. The  prevalence of overweight, smoking, hypertension and diabetes has been found to increase the risk of IS. But most  importantly, genetic factors played an important role in the exploration of stroke risk, especially IS.  

Matrix metal lo protein as es (MMPs) are calcium-dependent zinc endo pep tid as es of the metzincin superfamily. It is  usually expressed as an inactive proenzyme with a propeptide domain. Pro peptides are cleaved during exocrine secretion  to activate MMP enzymes. Currently, human MMP homologues have been reported, which are divided into six  subfamilies: collagen as e, gelatinase, matrix hemolysin, membrane metal lo protein as es and other MMPs. , MMPs  played a role in the physiological processes of neuro inflammatory response 12  and ang io genesis. MMPs were also  involved in many physiological and pathological processes of the brain and blood–brain barrier. Gelatin as es MMP2 15   $\mathrm{MMP9^{16}}$    and  were the most studied in the destruction of blood–brain barrier (BBB) after IS. Also, in an article reported  by Takeuchi et al, altering MMP9 activity reduced BBB damage. However, the function of  MMP17  has not been  reported in the physiological process of IS.  

In the study, we selected variants of  MMP17  (rs6598163, rs34515698 and rs7975920) on the basis of the 1000-genome  project. Based on Agena MassARRAY platform, we designed amplification primers and extension primers for these sites.  Later, we analyzed the genotype distribution of  MMP17  polymorphisms in cases and controls and their correlation with the  risk of IS population from Shaanxi province in China, so as to provide insights into the pathogen es is of IS.  

# Method  

# Study Subjects  

Of the study, 1345 subjects (670 controls and 675 cases) were randomly recruited from Xi’an No.3 Hospital. The cases  were confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The exclusion criteria  for IS patients were to exclude patients who have suffered from systemic inflammatory disease, coronary artery disease,  cerebral hemorrhage, and so on. The healthy people were determined by the annual health assessment from the physical  examination center of the hospital and they had no history of cerebro vascular disease or myocardial infarction,  hypertension and so on. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of declaration of Helsinki  in 1975. And the study was approved by the ethics Committee of Xi’an No.3 Hospital, each participant had written  informed consent.  

# Clinical Data Collection  

In the study, we collected data on age, gender, family history, smoking and drinking from the participants’ medical  records. Based on the physical examination report of subjects, some biochemical parameters, such as alanine amino­ transfer as e, aspartate amino transfer as e, platelet count, platelet-specific volume, albumin, total bilirubin, leukocyte count,  triglyceride, percentage of monocytes, basophil count, red blood cell count, mean hemoglobin concentration, etc. were  collected. All indicators were tested by professional technicians according to standard operating methods.  

# DNA Extraction, SNPs Selection, and Genotyping  

In the fasting state,   $3\ \mathrm{mL}$   blood sample was collected from each participant by a professional and stored with an  anticoagulant tube of EDTA. Genomic DNA was then extracted from the participants’ blood samples by GoldMag-Mini  Whole Blood Genomic DNA Purification Kit (GoldMag Co. Ltd., Xi′an, China) as the amplification template. The  concentration and purity of genomic DNA were determined by Nanodrop 2000. Based on the 1000-genome project  ( https://www.international genome.org/ ), we chose loci with minor allele frequencies (MAFs)  ${>}5\%$   and Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium (HWE)   ${\tt>}0.01$   in the global population. Primers (amplification and extension) design were complete by  Agena MassARRAY Assay Designer 3.1 (shown in the  Supplementary Table 1 ). Based on Agena MassARRAY platform,  genotyping of  MMP17  SNPs were fulfilled. The sequencing data were sorted and analyzed by Agena Bioscience TYPER,  version 4.0.  

# Statistical Analyses  

All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 19.0 and Microsoft Excel 22.0. The continuous variables were  expressed as mean  $\pm$   standard error (SE) and compared by Student’s   $t\cdot$  -test. The expected genotype frequencies of SNPs  were compared with the actual genotype frequencies in the control group with the chi-square test assay to detect  whether these sites were consistent with HWE. The allele and genotype frequencies of the selected SNPs were  analyzed with chi-squared tests. Then, based on PLINK software, version 1.07, the odds ratios (OR) and   $95\%$    confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression analysis to assess the association between   $M M P l7$    polymorphisms and IS risk. Significant results were tested by FPRP analysis (power   $\mathrm{OR}\,=\,2.0$   and prior probability  level of “0.25, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001”). MDR software observed the interaction (synergy or antagonism) among  SNPs to predict its relationship with IS risk.   $P<0.05$   indicated statistical significance.

# The Basic Information of Study Subjects and Variants  

In total, 670 controls (440 males and 230 females) and 675 cases (455 males and 220 females) were randomly recruited  ( Supplementary Table 2 ). The basic information of subjects’ characteristics was shown in the table The mean age of 670  controls and 675 cases were   $55.61{\scriptstyle\pm0.35}$   years old and  $54.91{\scriptstyle\pm0.26}$   years old, respectively. By calculation, the two groups  were matched by age   $(p=0.107)$   and gender   $\left(p=0.500\right)$  ). Moreover, smokers and drinkers were evenly distributed in the  two groups   $\textstyle f=0.608$  ,  $p=0.684$  ). Additionally, we collected some clinical parameters of the participants (not shown).  

In  Table 1 , the basic information of the selected SNPs in  MMP17  gene, including chromosome, position, alleles,  minor allele frequency (MAF) in cases and controls, consequence and HWE  $p$  -value. In the allele model, subjects with  rs7975920-C were more likely to develop IS (OR: 1.25,   $p=0.010\$  ).  

# The Association Between  MMP17  Polymorphisms and Ischemic Stroke Risk  

We introduced four genetic models (codominant, dominant, recessive and log-additive) to further study the effect of these loci  on the risk of IS ( Table 2 ). Rs7975920 conferred an increased susceptibility to IS (Heterozygous  $\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{C}$  : OR: 1.27,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.035$  ;  Homozygous  $\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{C}$  : OR: 1.57,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.044$  ; log-additive: OR: 1.26,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.009)$  ). Also, we used FPRP analysis to verify the  significant results in the allele model (Power  $=0.983$  , FPRP values  $=0.029$  , 0.081), the heterozygous model (Power  $=0.921$  ,

Besides, we assessed the relationship between genotypes at different loci and clinical parameters (alanine  amino transfer as e, aspartate amino transfer as e, platelet count, platelet-specific volume, albumin, total bilirubin, leu­ kocyte count, triglyceride, percentage of monocytes, basophil count, red blood cell count, mean hemoglobin  concentration, etc.) shown in  Supplementary Table 3 . We observed that patients with different genotypes (A/A,   $\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}$   and G/G) of rs6598163 had significantly different clinical parameters (alanine amino transfer as e, aspartate  amino transfer as e, platelet-specific volume, albumin, total bilirubin) in cases. Healthy people with different geno­ types (A/A, G/A and   $\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{G}$  ) of rs6598163 had significantly different clinical parameters (alanine amino transfer as e,  aspartate amino transfer as e, platelet count, platelet-specific volume) in controls. In addition, carriers of rs7975920  genotypes (G/G, G/C and C/C) in controls and cases had different clinical parameters (leukocyte count, triglyceride,  percentage of monocytes, basophil count, platelet-specific volume, red blood cell count and mean hemoglobin  concentration).  

# Association Between  MMP17  Polymorphisms and Ischemic Stroke Risk Stratified by  Age and Gender  

gAge and gender stratification analysis was also done in the assessment of the association between  MMP17  polymorphisms and IS stroke risk ( Table 4 ). In the subjects aged   ${>}55$   years old, the significant association between  rs7975920 and IS risk was displayed in the allele (OR: 1.43,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.005)$  , heterozygous (OR: 1.51,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.013)$  ),  dominant (OR: 1.54,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.007)$  ) and log-additive (OR: 1.42,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.008)$  ) models. In females, the locus was  closely associated with IS risk in the allele (OR: 1.47,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\ =\ 0.008)$  , heterozygous (OR: 1.77,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\ =\ 0.006$  ),

# Association Between  MMP17  Polymorphisms and Ischemic Stroke Risk Stratified by  Smoking and Drinking  

Smoking and drinking stratification analysis was also done in assessing the relationship between  MMP17  variants and IS risk  ( Table 5 ). The results indicated that rs6598163 was related to the risk of IS (allele G: OR: 1.36,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.006$  ; Heterozygous  $\mathrm{G}/$  A: OR: 1.6  $0,p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,{=}\,0.016$  ; Homozygous G/G: OR: 1.  $77,p_{\mathrm{adj}}\!=\!0.013$  ; dominant G/A-G/G: OR: 1.65,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,{=}\,0.006$  ; log-additive:  OR: 1.34,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.011$  ) in smokers. Rs7975920 was associated with the risk of IS (allele C: OR: 1.35,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.017$  ;  Heterozygous   $\mathrm{G/C}$  : OR: 1.41,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.044$   dominant   $\mathrm{G/C-C/C}$  : OR: 1.42,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.033$  ; log-additive: OR:   $1.30,p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.046$  )  in smoker and was in correlation with IS risk (allele C: OR: 1.3  $3,p_{\mathrm{adj}}\!=\!0.022$  ; log-additive: OR: 1.31,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,{=}\,0.037)$   in drinkers.  However, the two variants were not found to be associated with IS risk in non-smokers and non-drinkers.  

# SNP-SNP Interaction Analyzed by the MDR Software Was Used to Predict Ischemic  Stroke Risk  

Then, we used MDR software to analyze the impact of potential SNP–SNP interaction on IS risk ( Table 6 ). The two-locus model containing  MMP17  variants (rs34515698 and rs7975920) was considered to be the best model for the effect  of SNP–SNP interaction on IS risk (cross-validation consistency   $=10/10$  , testing balanced accuracy  $\d s=53.6\%$  , OR: 1.37,   $95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=1.11{-}1.71$  ,  $p=0.004)$  ). We displayed the interaction between each site with the dendrogram (In  Figure 1A ) and  circle graph ( Figure 1B ). In  Figure 1B , the interaction between rs34515698 and rs7975920 was antagonistic, with the  information gain value   $-0.42\%$  .

# Discussion  

Globally, IS is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality. It may be the result of multiple factors,  among which genetic factors are the least negligible. In the present research,  MMP17  rs7975920 conferred an increased  susceptibility to IS. In subjects aged   ${>}55$   years old and females, there was a significant association between rs7975920  and IS risk. Also, the results indicated that  MMP17  rs6598163 was related to the risk of IS in smokers. In addition,  rs7975920 was associated with the risk of IS in smokers and drinkers. We hope that the results of this study will lay  a foundation for the role of  MMP17  gene in the pathogen es is of IS, and also provide theoretical clues for the  pathogen es is of IS.  

MMPs are a family of pro teo ly tic enzymes that played a key role in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, as well  as in mediating inter cellular adhesion and cytokine signaling. Except MMP-28, all MMPs are widely expressed in  mammals. In general, the expression level of MMP was low, but MMP-2 and MT1-MMP were constitutive ly expressed  in precursor and activated forms in the brain. On the contrary, TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of metal lo protein as es), an  inhibitor of MMP-mediated pro teo ly tic activity, can inactivate MMP activity by combining with MMP, , which can  prevent excessive tissue degradation and damage under physiological conditions. In other conditions, MMPs can also be  activated by reactive oxygen species and other influencing factors.  

Recent reports indicated that MMP-related factors played an important role in cerebro vascular diseases, such as  IS. , MMP17 , a member of membrane metal lo protein as es, has been involved in the studies of intra cranial aneurysm  (IA) and thoracic aortic aneurysm. In an article published by Kim et al, they comprehensively investigated the  relationship between MMP variants and IA susceptibility using GWAS. The results indicated that MMPs genes, including  MMP17  gene, increased susceptibility to IA. In a separate paper reported by Martín-Alonso et al,  MMP17  was crucial for  the maturity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and played an important role in the function of arterial walls. Not only that, in mice, loss of Mmp17 leaded to dysfunction of VSMCs and changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of  vascular wall. Mmp17 deficiency also increased susceptibility to angiotensin II–induced aortic thoracic aneurysms by  altering the ECM in arterial walls. In addition, Kim et al found that  MMP17  rs79572159 had a protective against IA  formation. However, so far, the possible role of  MMP17  SNPs in IS has not been reported. The present report first  showed that  MMP17  rs7975920 and rs6598163 were related to the risk of IS, especially in smokers and drinkers. The  above results revealed the importance of smoking and drinking for IS-related studies.

Figure 1  MDR software was used to analyze the impact of potential SNP-SNP interaction on IS risk. From the ( A ) dendrogram and ( B ) circle graph, the two-locus model  containing rs34515698 and rs7975920 was considered to be the best model.  

In conclusion, we first observed that  MMP17  rs7975920 and rs6598163 were related to the risk of IS. The above  results provided a theoretical basis for the elaboration of the role of  MMP17  in IS in the population from Shaanxi  province in China.
