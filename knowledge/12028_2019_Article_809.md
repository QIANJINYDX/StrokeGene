# Abstract  

Background:   Patients with aneurysmal sub ara ch noid hemorrhage (aSAH) require close treatment in neuro inten‑ sive care units (NICUs). The treatments available to counteract secondary deterioration and delayed ischemic events  remain restricted; moreover, available neuro-monitoring of comatose patients is undependable. In comatose patients,  clinical signs are hidden, and timing interventions to prevent the evolution of a perfusion disorder in response to fixed  ischemic brain damage remain a challenge for NICU teams. Consequently, comatose patients often suffer second‑ ary brain infarction s. The outcomes for long-term intubated patients w/wo pupil dilatation are the worst, with only   $10\%$   surviving. We previously added two nitroxide (NO) donors to the standard treatment: continuous intravenous  administration of Mol si domine in patients with mild-to-moderate aSAH and, if required as a supplement, intraven‑ tricular boluses of sodium nitro prussi de (SNP) in high-risk patients to overcome the so-called NO-sink effect, which  leads to vasospasm and perfusion disorders. NO boluses were guided by clinical status and promptly reversed recur‑ rent episodes of delayed ischemic neurological deficit. In this study, we tried to translate this concept, the initiation  of intra ventricular NO application on top of continuous Mol si domine infusion, from awake to comatose patients who  lack neurological–clinical monitoring but are primarily monitored using frequently applied trans cranial Doppler (TCD).  

Methods:   In this observational, retrospective, non randomized feasibility study, 18 consecutive aSAH comatose/intu‑ bated patients (Hunt and Hess IV/V with/without pupil dilatation) whose poor clinical status precluded clinical moni‑ toring received standard neuro-intensive care, frequent TCD monitoring, continuous intravenous Mol si domine plus  intra ventricular SNP boluses after TCD-confirmed macrospasm during the daytime and on a fixed nighttime schedule.  

Results:   Very likely associated with the application of SNP, which is a matter of further investigation, vasospasmrelated TCD findings promptly and reliably reversed or substantially weakened   $(p\!<\!0.0001]$  ) afterward. Delayed cerebral  ischemia (DCI) occurred only during loose, low-dose or interrupted treatment (  $17\%$   vs. an estimated  $65\%$   with sec‑ ondary infarction s) in 17 responders. However, despite their worse initial condition,   $29.4\%$   of the responders survived  (expected  $10\%$  ) and four achieved Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE)   $^{8-6,}$   modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0–1 or  National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 0–2.  

Conclusions:   Even in comatose/intubated patients, TCD-guided dual-compartment administration of NO donors  probably could reverse macrospasm and seems to be feasible. The number of DCI was much lower than expected in  this specific subgroup, indicating that this treatment possibly provides a positive impact on outcomes. A randomized  trial should verify or falsify our results.

# Introduction  

Following  aneurysmal  sub ara ch noid  hemorrhage  (aSAH), oxygenated, high-pressure blood accumulates in the sub ara ch noid space [ 1 ] where it increases  intra cranial pressure (ICP) and evokes early brain  injury (EBI) [ 2 – 4 ], ultra-early   $(<6~\mathrm{h})$   vasospasm [ 5 ] and  cortical and/or global cerebral ischemia [ 6 ,  7 ]. Dur- ing the subsequent week(s),   $70\%$   of all-grade patients  develop delayed macrospasm and an uncertain number of spasms in the micro vas cula ture and up to   $50\%$  have delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) with poor outcomes. After a ruptured aneurysm is fixed, this natural history of aSAH shifts therapeutic responsibility  from the neuro surgical to the neuro intensive care unit 

 (NICU) team, which has limited therapeutic choices 

 (Nimodipine and/or induced hypertension) [ 8 – 10 ]  while monitoring clinical status, blood and ICP, laboratory parameters and blood flow velocity by trans cranial  Doppler (TCD).  

The exact path o mechanisms of EBI, early and/or  delayed vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) followed by DCI and poor outcomes remain  debated [ 6 ]. It is, however, widely accepted that oxyhemoglobin and its degradation products, which are  potent nitroxide (NO) scavengers, derail the vasodilatory activity of endo the li al and neuronal NO synthases,  further evoking endo the li al dysfunction ([ 11 – 13 ], please  see “ Appendix ”). Decreased NO availability in the arterial  wall endothelium coupled with the depletion of brain NO  stores [ 14 ], which affects conductive arteries and microcirculation and limits the perfusion of the cortex by triggering local vasospasm, spreading de polarizations and  leading to spreading ischemia [ 15 ,  16 ].  

Previously, an intravenous infusion of NO-donor  Mol si domine [ 17 ,  18 ] (see “ Appendix ”) demonstrated  a significant improvement in outcomes with lower  rates of DCI [ 17 ] in all-grade aSAH patients but had no  impact on macro va so spasm; its effect is thought to be  on micro circulation. Additionally, in an awake female  patient and guided by her clinical status, multiple  clinical DCIs and radio logically confirmed vasospasms  were rapidly reversed by combining intravenous Molsidomine with intra ventricular sodium nitro prussi de  (SNP) boluses, which achieved excellent outcomes [ 18 ].  

Whether an intravenous and on-demand intra vent ric ular NO substitution can also be useful in extremely difficult to monitor, comatose, Hunt and Hess grade IV/V  patients in a bedside NICU setting is addressed in this  study.  

# Materials and Methods  

This study took place in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a  maximum care hospital in 2016–2017. The design of this  feasibility study is observational, non randomized and  retrospective. The endpoints of the study were the relief  of vasospasm as measured by TCD and the numbers of  secondarily developed delayed brain infarction s; the latter were compared to the results expected in this subgroup. We included 18 subsequent long-term comatose  patients (8 males, 10 females) aged 38–83  years (mean  59  years; SD 13  years; range 32–83  years) post-aSAH  (modified Fisher IV [ 1 ]) in Hunt–Hess grades IV (without) and V (with) pupil dilatation ([ 19 – 21 ], definitions in 

 “ Appendix ”) who did not recover after cerebrospinal fluid 

 (CSF) drainage and treatment of the aneurysm. Including  eight patients with intra cerebral and one with subdural  hematomas, seven patients presented with ultra-early  vasospasm (  $\langle<6\mathrm{~h~}$   after aSAH, Table  1 ). All patients had  poor prognoses with an expected survival rate of   $10\%$   [ 22 ,  23 ] and the maximal risk of developing delayed vasospasm and delayed brain infarction s. Additionally, an  NO-based treatment was offered to supplement standard  therapy. Verbal and subsequent written informed consent  was obtained from relatives or legal guardians within   $^{12-36\mathrm{~h~}}$   after aSAH. This retrospective, non randomized  feasibility study met the principles of the Declaration of  Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee  (PV5410).  

As clinical worsening is concealed in comatose  patients, currently available surrogate parameters are  difficult to interpret and prone to failure [ 24 ]. Even the  use of continuous TCD, electro co ch leo graph y or elect roe ncep halo gram (EEG) recordings in unconscious  individuals does not replace the clinical alarm signal of  DIND because their placement, sensitivity and specificity  are inconsistent. The clinical relevance of findings could  therefore be unclear or is often recognized only after the  ischemic lesion has already occurred.

Monitoring of the comatose patients in this study  included internationally recommended ICU standards,  near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS, CASMED Fore-Sight  ELITE, Branford CT, USA), real-time assessment of  regional cortical oxygenation and ICP monitoring. For  dedicated surveillance of these unconscious patients,  we frequently applied TCD screening of all major brainsupplying arteries, with special attention to the aliasing,  pul s at ili ty, flow turbulence s, flow velocities, a spectral  broadening and shape changes, especially the appearance  of tardus and parvus waves.  

After the ruptured aneurysm was secured, each patient  started an oral   $(6\times60~\mathrm{mg})$   or intravenous   $(1{-}2\ \mathrm{mg/h})$  Nimodipine [ 9 ,  10 ] regimen according to accepted  standards.  

Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was kept at   $\mathrm{>65\mmHg}$   when there was no evidence of vasospasm on  diagnostic imaging or TCD and at   $80{-}105~\mathrm{mmHg}$   (zeroing at cardiac atrium) when vasospasm was detected. The  estimated degree of vasospasm, the presence or absence  of suspected disorders of micro circulation, general  medical conditions, preexisting p are nch y mal bleeding  or coiling and clipping-related infarction s, the amount  of va so press or s (if) needed and the possible impact of  Nimodipine on systemic blood pressure were considered. Mol si domine was started intravenously at   $1.6~\mathrm{mg/h}$    (2 ampoules  $/20~\mathrm{mg}$   diluted in   $50~\mathrm{{ml}}$  saline and started at   $2\ \mathrm{m/h})$  ) within   $^{12-36\mathrm{~h~}}$   after aSAH. The Mol si domine  dose was increased in a stepwise manner   $(1.6\;\mathrm{\meg/h})$    every   $\ensuremath{{3-4}}\,\mathrm{{h}}$   to achieve a dose of   $16\;\mathrm{mg/h}$   within 2–3 days  [ 17 ]. No more than   $500\ \ \upmu\mathrm{g/h}$   of noradrenaline was  needed to keep   $\mathrm{MAP}\!>\!65\:\:\mathrm{mmHg}$  . During episodes of  infection, low cardiac output, or isoflurane administration, noradrenaline was increased   $(900{-}8350~\upmu\mathrm{g/h})$   with  occasional adjustment of the Mol si domine dose. At the  end of therapy, in parallel with Nimodipine, the Molsidomine dose was tapered for 5–8 days.  

TCD was used to detect vasospasm in conductive  arteries. It was performed at least three times during daytime and on-demand during periods of increased risk of  vasospasm. Macrospasm was assumed when (a) the mean  flow exceeded   $150\,\mathrm{\cm}/\mathrm{s}$   (probable),   $190\,\mathrm{\cm}/\mathrm{s}$   (severe)  or   $290~\mathrm{cm/s}$   (critical) in the middle cerebral artery and  the anterior cerebral arteries); (b) when it exceeded 

  $>\!120\,\mathrm{~cm}/\mathrm{s}$   (severe) in the vertebral/basilar artery; and 

 (c) when significant changes were observed in TCD flow  signals (appearance of an alias phenomenon, increase in  mean velocity with spectral broadening, elevated pulsatility index, turbulent flow, tardus and parvus waves). Mean  flows in stenoses prior to tardus and parvus segments  were extrapolated  $>\!350\,\mathrm{~cm}/\mathrm{s}$  . Caution was advised for  any sudden flow acceleration or a Lindegaard’s index  $>3$  [ 25 ,  26 ]. Almost all TCD measurements were performed  by the same examiner to avoid inter observer variability.  

If despite the general treatment, including the induction of hypertension, a TCD-confirmed severe macros- pasm occurred, a bedside SNP bolus was applied via an  external ventricular drain (EVD). Each bolus contained   $2{-}10~\mathrm{mg}$   of SNP (mean 5.6 mg, SD 2.5 mg) [ 18 ]. The vol- ume of the SNP bolus was adjusted for the dead space of  the catheter   $(3\;\mathrm{{ml})}$  ). If the ICP prior to SNP was elevated  (up to   $20{-}22~\mathrm{mmHg},$  ), the concentration of the SNP was  doubled or quadrupled to reduce the volume burden, and   $5~\mathrm{{ml}}$  of CSF was removed; each application was applied  on a case-by-case basis. No SNP was applied if the baseline ICP was higher than this limit. After the SNP bolus  as administered, the EVD was closed for  $<5\;\mathrm{min}$  , and ICP  and MAP were monitored. If ICP reached   $\mathrm{>}\,30\ \mathrm{mmHg},$  ,  the EVD was opened to release a few milliliters of CSF/ SNP mixture until the ICP returned to a level under   $20\ \mathrm{mmHg}$  . No post-SNP elevation in ICP persisted, and  all patients returned to baseline limits after a few minutes. ICP increases were frequently accompanied by  tachycardia. The cranial computed tomography controls  showed no associated brain edema.  

After saturation with Mol si domine, each SNP bolus  (except in the case of the non responder) led to a generally  enormous increase in systemic blood pressure that was  interpreted as a brainstem reflex on intra cranial/intracerebral va so dilation [ 27 ]. No brady car dia occurred, making  a Cushing reflex implausible.  

Control TCDs were performed after SNP administration once MAP reached values prior to application  again (within   $20{-}30\ \mathrm{min})$  ) to exclude an impact of systemic hypertension. Therapeutic success was assumed if  a normalization of TCD values and regular signals (re) occurred (Fig.   2 ), because a high-grade macrospasm  commonly persists for a much longer interval than   $30{-}60\ \mathrm{min}$  .  

The presence of serious, recurrent vasospasm on  TCD prompted first an SNP bolus and, if advisable, a  computed tomography angiography (CTA) and/or CT  perfusion (CTP) study to quantify the findings   $(n\!=\!28)$  ). If  advisable and achievable in a timely manner, digital subtractive angiography (DSA) was performed in the preparation for an intra-arterial administration of Nimodipine  (chemical va so spasm o lysis: 18 events in 10 patients,   $n\!=\!6$   in the non responder). A few patients received SNP  bolus(es) just prior to CTA, CTP diagnostics or DSA, and  this allowed an assessment of effects.  

CT was performed on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 after aSAH,  before discharge, on-demand, and   $24\textrm{h}$  after each neu- rosurgical or neuro radiological intervention. Supplementary CTP, CTA and DSA were used to diagnose  vasospasm and perfusion disorders and as a possible  trans lumina l intervention. As the patients were critically  ill, imaging was performed only when clinically justifiable with a preference for the less risky CT than magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI). In surviving patients, MRI was  performed before discharge and during follow-up.  

Findings were independently assessed for vasospasm  and hypo densities by a blinded, experienced neuroradiologist who was not a member of the study team. The  neuro radiological assessments included an evaluation  of the threshold-based interpretation of CT perfusion  using mean transit time (MTT) and cerebral blood flow/ volume (CBF/CBV) measurements. Pathological values  were defined according to [ 28 ]: MTT values  $>6.4$   s, CBF  and CBV values  $<39.3$   and  $<4.4$   cm   $3/100\ \mathrm{g},$   respectively,  in comparison with the degree of reduction in vascular  caliber measured by a caliper on DSA.  

Additionally, the impact on micro circulation was  assessed by estimating the flooding and washing out  times of contrast media in affected vessels. A comparison of arterial stenosis findings between CTA and conventional DSA was performed using an electronic caliper.  If applicable, perfusion disorders and their resolution  were examined by comparing them prior to post-SNP  application. Newly arisen hypo densities observed on CT  were evaluated for possible classification (postoperative, other causes, related to spasm) by an experienced  neuro radiologist.  

Initially, intra ventricular TCD-guided SNP boluses  were administered in two patients during the daytime.  A normalization of malignant 4-vessel vasospasm was  achieved after the administration of repeated boluses of  SNP. However, vasospasm recurred during the following  nights, and both patients died with massive brain infarctions. Consequently, SNP administration at fixed intervals was introduced during the nights when TCD was  unavailable.  

First, nocturnal bridging was used every   $^{8\mathrm{~h},}$   but the  occurrence of a small watershed infarction in one patient  prompted a change to SNP boluses every   $^{3-4\mathrm{~h~}}$   (Fig.  1 ).

Subsequently, no further secondary brain ischemia  occurred, except for treatment interruptions in two  patients.  

For cumulative daily quantities  $,>50~\mathrm{mg}~\mathrm{SNR}$  , a prophylactic intravenous administration of sodium th io sulfate   $(50~\mathrm{mg/kg}$   of body weight) was considered to minimize  the risk of cyanide poisoning.  

To control a hypertensive crisis evoked by SNP-induced  intra cerebral vasodilatation,   $40{-}360~\mathrm{mg}$   of Urapidil and/ or   $50{-}300\ \mathrm{mg}$   of propofol were used, and accompanying tachycardia or t achy arrhythmia was reverted after  Metoprolol. To limit nausea and vomiting after SNP  bolus administration, most patients required intravenous On danse tron and the evacuation of gastric content- delaying oral Nimodipine administration.  

Silver-coated ventricular catheters were replaced every  14 days to minimize the risk of vent ric ul it is. CSF samples  were analyzed every 2 days.  

Determinations of Mol si domine levels and SNP degradation products in CSF were not technically possible.  Laboratory monitoring was limited to blood gas, lactate  and met hemoglobin levels.  

The follow-up of survivors was performed by independent physicians at 6 and 18  months after discharge  and included an MRI and a visit.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version  9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., USA). Beyond descriptive statistics, TCD and NIRS values were compared between  pre- and post-SNP using linear mixed models, and the  corresponding   $p$   values were calculated. The models  included a subject-specific random intercept to account  for repeated measurements of TCD and NIRS values  in the same patient using a restricted maximum likelihood approach. Based on the fitted models, the mean  differences in TCD and NIRS values between pre- and  post-SNP were evaluated for significance. All results  are considered exploratory, not confirmatory.   $p$   values  are regarded as noticeable (“significant”) when   $p\!\leq\!0.05$  without adjustment for multiple testing. An overall significance level was not determined and could not be  calculated. Power analysis revealed that in our study, 17  patients with an average of 10 (pathological) measurements per patient and an expected intraclass correlation   $\rho\!=\!0.5$   provided at least   $80\%$   power to detect a clinically  relevant effect of SNP on mean flow velocities and NIRS.  This means that after SNP administration, mean flow  velocities decreased by   $13\%$   (a measurable change in the  mean between pre- and post-SNP, with a standard deviation  $\cdot\pm50\%,$  ), and NIRS values increased by   $15\%$     $(\pm\,25\%)$  or more.  

# Results  

Seventeen  patients  (including  the  non responder)  received and tolerated well the continuous intravenous  high-dose administration of Mol si domine at   $16\,\mathrm{\meg/h}$  .  One patient, due to septic conditions, reached a maximum of  $6.4\,\mathrm{mg/h}$  .  

All patients developed delayed cerebral vasospasm with  perfusion disturbances between the 3rd and 13th day

(mean 7 days; SD 2.5 days) as diagnosed by TCD, CTA,  CTP or DSA.  

In 16/17 patients who achieved   $16\,\mathrm{\meg/h}$   of Molsid- omine, severe vasospasm was documented in 380 complete TCDs (per patient mean 23; SD 21; range 4–86).  In all, 208 TCD recordings revealed mean flow values  exceeding 150–290 in anterior circulation or   $>\!110~\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s}$  in BA, 172 TCDs documented broadening, mal-pulsatile and filiform (parvus or tardus) signals (assessed as  an estimated flow of   $>\!350\ \mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s}$   in the upstream sten- otic segment). Each control TCD was performed soon  after normalization of MAP and ICP elevations due to  SNP administration to reduce the impact of “induced  hypertension” or the natural course of vasospasm. Pathological findings substantially weakened or reversed  in   $96\%$   of the cases instantly after single or repetitive  boluses of SNP (mean dose   $5.6\ \mathrm{mg};\ \mathrm{SD}\ 2.5\ \mathrm{mg};$   range   $_{2-10\mathrm{\meg})}$  . Broadening, filiform/parvus and tardus signals normalized either fully or almost completely within   $30{-}90~\mathrm{min}$   after SNP (Fig.  2 , Table  2 ). On 51 occasions,  2–3 boluses (a total of 128 repetitions) with or without  increasing SNP doses were required for TCD to return to  normal flow profiles. One patient was a non responder to  both Mol si domine and SNP.  

In responders, the mean flow velocities decreased after  single and repeated SNP administrations by   $43\%$   (mean

$100\ \mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s};$  ; SD   $44~\mathrm{{cm}}/{\bf s};$  ; range   $40{-}300\ \mathrm{cm/s};$  ;   $p\!<\!0.0001\!,$  )  and  $52\%$   (mean  $96\;\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s};$  ; SD   $56\;\mathrm{cm}/s;$  ; range  $40–350\;\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s};$  ;   $p\!<\!0.0001\rangle$  ).  

The low-dose patient showed a relief of the spasms on  TCD as well as a circulatory reaction (hypertension) from  approximately   $6~\mathrm{m}\mathrm{g/h}$   on, and we therefore assumed a  threshold dose of Mol si domine would influence both  spasms and systemic blood pressure by SNP.  

After each SNP bolus, ICP increased immediately. A  short-term rise in   $\mathrm{ICP\!<\!30\,\ m m H g}$   was not addressed,  whereas an increase   $\mathrm{of}\,{>}\,30\,\mathrm{\mmHg}$   prompted intermittent CSF drainage until ICP returned to initial ranges,  usually within  $<5$    min. Each bolus was carefully monitored for changes in MAP, which was kept at or below   $105\:\mathrm{\mmHg}$  . Systemic hypertension was often accompanied by tachycardia and evoked by an SNP bolus and  lasted approximately  ${20}{-}{60}\operatorname*{min}$  ; during that time, MAP,  cranial perfusion pressure (CPP) and ICP were closely  monitored. CPP changes were not documented due to  rapid MAP changes, and ICP quickly returned to the initial value. No evidence for a Cushing reflex was observed.  

Per TCD, a recurrence of a previously resolved vasospasm was often detected within   $^{3-5\mathrm{~h~}}$   after SNP bolus  administration. Such progression, resolution and recurrence of vasospasm after SNP persisted for 8  days (SD  4 days; range 2–16 days).  

If imaging was performed before (CTA and CTP) and  after (DSA) an application of SNP, the subsequent DSA  showed the resolution of existing perfusion disorders and  vasospasm (example: Fig.  3 ).  

Moreover, after the introduction of a bridging scheme  for nightly administrations of SNP without TCD guidance and during high-dose instances of Mol si domine  administration, no more ischemic events occurred   $(n\!=\!15$   responding patients;   $83\%$  ). No diffuse brain  edema was observed.  

The NIRS values after single and repeated SNP  administrations increased by   $17\%$     $(p\!<\!0.0001)$   and   $15\%$   $(p\!=\!0.02)$  , respectively (SD   $14\%$  ; range   $5{-}85\%$  hese  values remained unchanged in three patients (4%) and  showed similar changes bilaterally, very probably indicating an augmentation of tissue oxygenation and suggesting a lack of a steal phenomenon.  

The survival rate was   $29.4\%$   among responders. Twelve  patients died, two because of re occurrence of vasospasm  at night and the remaining ten because of their critical illness or while within therapy limitations as per their living  will. The non responder died of a massive stroke.  

A follow-up performed by an independent physician  (6  months after discharge) revealed that three patients  had completely recovered and returned back to their former life and job   $(17.7\%)$  . One patient suffered left-sided,  low-grade paresis but remained independent while working part-time (GOSE8/6; mRS0/1; NIHSS0/2; please see  “ Appendix ”). No cognitive deficits occurred in any of  these four patients   $(23.5\%)$  . One patient required highgrade care.  

# Adverse Effects  

In the context of Mol si domine, a rebound phenomenon  can occur [ 29 ]. One patient developed a septic shock  during the escalation of the Mol si domine dose, which  required interruption for   $24\ \mathrm{~h~}$   and high-dose vasopressors followed by its reintroduction at a low dose   $(1.6{-}3.6~\mathrm{mg/h})$   for 5 days. The patient rapidly developed  severe vasospasm-associated brain infarction s after Molsidomine was stopped. Notably, despite the re initiation  of low-dose Mol si domine therapy, this patient did not  respond with an expected MAP elevation to any SNP  bolus (given every   $^\textrm{\scriptsize4h}$  ,   $n\!=\!36$  ) until the Mol si domine  dose w  $\mathrm{{as}\,{>}\,6\ m g/h,}$  , suggesting that a “saturation” dose of  Mol si domine was necessary to exert a va so dilatory effect  of SNP [ 18 ]. Afterward, no further infarction s occurred,  and interestingly, each SNP bolus was accompanied by  hypertension requiring an adequate response.

2: After unintended Mol si domine interruption  

ACA​  anterior cerebral artery,   ${\mathsf{C T A}}\subset{\mathsf{T}}$   angiography,  $C T P\subset T$   perfusion,  DSA  digital subs traction angiography,  MCA  middle cerebral artery,  NA  not applicable,  SNP  sodium  nitro prusside,  TCD  trans cranial doppler sonography  

A second patient, who had an unintended interruption of Mol si domine infusion for  $>3.5$   half-lives, devel- oped massive vasospasm with vessel truncation on CTA  and CTP with critical perfusion disturbances (Fig.   3   and Table   3 ). After the urgent restarting of Molsidomine infusion and repeated SNP applications   $(n\!=\!5$  ;   $_{6-10\ \mathrm{mg}}$  , severe hypertension developed, and TCD values promptly normalized with DSA, revealing a dramatic  improvement in perfusion. A next-day CT revealed small  spotty infarction s in areas that formerly showed cerebral  blood volume decreases. A rebound phenomenon is not  expected with SNP boluses due to its very short half-life.  

In one patient, a preexisting norm o frequent atrial  fibrillation converted into an atrial t achy arrhythmia  that was reversed by Metoprolol. Often, a sinus tachycardia emerged after SNP boluses. A single asymptomatic increase in met hemoglobin   $(2.5\%)$   occurred, and  two patients received prophylactic sodium th io sulphate  for cyanide poisoning. Vomiting and nausea were frequent. In CSF samples, one infection with  Staphylococcus  aureus  was reported.  

# Discussion  

Despite the use of standard therapy, high Hunt–Hess  grade (IV/V° w/wo pupil dilatation) patients have a  heightened risk of DCIs, delayed brain infarction s (up to   $65\%$  ) and poor outcomes (up to  $90\%$  ) [ 30 – 32 ].  

Overall, among all-grade surviving patients, DCI develops in  $27\!-\!37\%$  ,  $5{-}10\%$   return to their former job [ 33 ] and   $75\%$   suffer from cognitive deficits [ 34 ].  

Numerous therapeutic attempts have been used to  address this serious prognosis. These include the use  of SNP only as a bolus or continuously after aSAH. The  results have been disappointing, inconsistent and unpredictable. Possible explanations are that these experiments  mainly focused on spasms in large vessels and not on  micro circulation at the p are nch y mal and cortical levels.  

As the dilatation of these small vessels and the large  brain arteries depend on the intra vascular, intra cerebral  and paravasal availability of NO, we supplied exogenous  NO (Mol si domine and SNP) to counteract the progressive loss of NO after aSAH.  

In neurologic ally assessable patients, the trigger for the  “local” administration of SNP was the development of  DIND, which reversed promptly after SNP application.  

Unfortunately, comatose patients elude the neurological examination required to initiate in-time intervention in cases of DIND. Moreover, previously, no perfect  replacement of neurological monitoring was available  because no monitoring device is perfect [ 36 ], and even  continuous TCD or EEG recordings are prone to, for  example, dislocation or misinterpretation. Unnoticed,  perfusion disorders can develop at any time with the  following infarcts. These patients can develop delayed  ischemia unnoticed at any time after aSAH.  

Being aware of this dilemma, we chose frequent TCD  controls to obtain a certain overview of the possibly  changing condition of each basal artery knowing that we  could not obtain a reliable view of the micro circulation  and parenchyma perfusion via TCD.  

To schedule any necessary rescue interventions, the  following monitoring criteria were measured: mean flow,  the Lindegaard index and changes in the signal waveform  (see above).  

We also used bifrontal NIRS measurements to measure the general oxygenation of the tissue and any possible  changes due to therapeutic procedures.  

If a natural temporal window for ultrasound examination was not available, we drilled artificial windows on  each side after obtaining consent from relatives.  

Rapidly after SNP application, precarious pathological TCD findings weakened or reversed to a significant  extent   $(p\!<\!0.0001)$   and a significant increase   $(p\!<\!0.0001)$    in tissue oxygenation was measured by the NIRS technique. Very likely, this indicates a success of the treatment, because (a) control measurements were performed  after re-establishment of the baseline MAP and ICP, (b)  a high-grade macrospasm persists despite the standard  treatment and (c) pertinacious macro spasms extremely  seldom resolve spontaneously in a rapid fashion. However, we cannot unequivocally exclude an impact of other  variables than SNP and, therefore, further investigations  are planned.  

However, likely as a result of the use of abundant and  repetitive TCD monitoring for the timing and control of  bedside SNP application, the attenuation of spasms was  fast enough to prevent a relevant number of secondary  brain infarction s, thus reducing it to below the expected  quantities in this subgroup (  $\cdot17\%$   vs.   $65\%$  ).  

An analysis of therapy interruptions, based on the context of the available literature reporting on mono-therapy  through SNP alone, revealed that pre saturation with    $\geq6~\mathrm{mg/h}$   Mol si domine prior to the SNP bolus seems to  be required to evoke an impact on TCD and NIRS values  [ 12 ].  

It could be a synergistic effect, which avoids the NOsink effect [ 13 ], thereby supporting endo the li al integrity  and vascular reactivity and allowing SNP to exert its vasodilatory effect.  

Because Mol si domine does not seem to have a clear  influence on the spasms of the large vessels but instead  appears to exert its effects on the micro circulation, a  synergism may have developed from the combination of  Mol si domine and SNP, which exerts its effect both on the  macro- and in the micro circulation. This notion is supported by earlier reports, both experimental [ 14 ,  35 ] and  clinical [ 17 ,  18 ], of the path o physiological importance  and clinical usefulness of NO-based therapy after aSAH.  

Hypertension in response to SNP commonly occurs  in combination with Mol si domine but is very rare with  SNP alone. This systemic hypertension is believed to be  a brainstem reflex to intra cranial/intra cerebral vasodila- tation of spastic vessels [ 27 ] and should not be mistaken  for a Cushing’s reflex that is accompanied by brady car dia.  Additionally, ICP increases were promptly reversible, and  no pupillary dilatation occurred.  

It is very likely that some of the scheduled nightly SNP  boluses delivered without TCD guidance were administered without vasospasm occurrence as we did not see  major systemic hypertension after all applications. This  observation supports the hypothesis that systemic hypertension was induced by effective vasodilatation of spastic  vessels.  

If these assumptions are correct, the surprising aboveaverage outcome   $17.7\%$   returned to their former lives,   $23.5\%$   were able to work, and   $29.4\%$   survived) of some of  our special patients who remained comatose long-term  could be explained.  

If so, TCD monitoring could be a useful strategy to  achieve better-than-predicted outcomes in patients after  aSAH and comatose patients because this may support  the in-time use of rescue therapies to prevent the transition of reversible cerebral perfusion disorder into a per- manent infarction.  

We are presenting a small cohort, that was treated aside  a standardized study condition, we are reporting on our  clinical experience. A registered trial including sufficient  numbers of patients with different World Federation of  Neuro surgical Societies (WFNS)/Hunt and Hess grades  will be necessary to validate our results. Fortunately, the  German Government is going to sponsor a 3-armed multicenter study. Notably, hypertension evoked by SNP will  preclude blinding during the treatment phase.  

# Limitations  

A small number of patients precluded random iz ation and  a control group. Unfortunately, German law restricts the  liberal use of uncommon compassionate or last resort  therapies to only a few individuals and case-by-case decisions only. As mentioned above, a well-powered randomized study is planned.  

Because we included the poorest grades in terms of  the Hunt and Hess grading modified by Yasargil, selection bias and disease severity bias occurred. Furthermore,  we compared our results with data obtained in roughly  similar selected patients (these studies do not provide  an exact description of patients’ conditions) in the literature, but definitions of gradings can vary (please see  “ Appendix ”). However, an independent neuro radiologist  analyzed the diagnostic imaging results, and follow-ups  were performed by blinded independent physicians.  

No measurement of serum or CSF levels of NO donors  or associated products was possible due to technical limitations in our and associated laboratories. However, single and  cumulating doses of both the Mol si domine and SNP used in  our study are common in clinical practice (Mol si domine) or  in the literature (SNP). Mol si domine amounts reached the  highest recommended dosage in cardiac surgery, and SNP  doses were at a medium range compared to the literature.  Of notice, the rebound phenomenon that can occur during  the use of Mol si domine strictly needs to be avoided.  

For rescue therapy, we used intra-arterial va so spas molysis also—this could be a confounder. However, to date,  a benefit for patients treated with this therapy has not  been proven and could be described as poor, especially in  cases with high Hunt and Hess/WFNS gradings [ 37 ].  

We could not address possible SNP-related neurotoxicity. However, in a different case series in which SNP  was applied continuously, reaching total amounts of   $200\,\mathrm{\mg/24\,\textmu}$  , no toxicity was reported. (The maximal  dose of SNP used in our study was  $76\:\mathrm{mg/24\:h}.$  )  

# Conclusions  

In long-term intubated comatose patients with or without pupil dilation after severe aSAH, dual-compartment  administration of two NO donors seems to be feasible  and safe. Most likely, combined NO donors promptly  as well as reliably led to a significant reduction in highgrade macrospasm and a reciprocal rise in tissue oxygenation as measured by TCD and NIRS prior and after SNP  application. However, seldom a rapid resolution of highgrade macrospasm could occur either in the spontaneous  course or by standard emergency treatment.  

Frequent TCD evaluation detected critical changes in  TCD flow velocities and shapes that promptly induced  the bedside application of SNP without loss of time due  to transportation, preparation of other rescue treatments  or diagnostics.  

It is likely that SNP diminished macro spasms before the  development of irreversible brain infarction s evolved. The  planned nocturnal SNP boluses were delivered on a fixed  time schedule and were carried out by the doctors on  duty in the NICU, and this probably also contributed to  the reduction in relevant vasospasms and perfusion disorders. This instantly applicable bedside tool for the NICU  team could prevent severely affected patients from having to undergo transport, examinations and emergency  treatments, which are dangerous and costly in terms of  patients and personnel but have not been proven effective. In our small cohort, we observed much lower rates  than expected of delayed brain infarction s in long-term  comatose patients, and this perhaps led to better-thanestimated outcomes. Obviously, an evaluation of our preliminary results is needed. The German government is  going to sponsor a prospective, randomized, statistically  sufficiently powered study.

NO in the Context of SAH  

Hemoglobin degradation is probably the most important factor that leads to nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, but  other factors may also induce NO shortage via additional  path o mechanisms (transient ischemia, reactive oxygen  species (ROS) production, etc.) evoked by aneurysmal  sub ara ch noid hemorrhage (aSAH).  

To understand the NO hemoglobin/cerebral blood  flow (CBF) relationship after aSAH, it is important to  recognize that   $70\%$   of regional (rCBF) and total CBF  [ 38 ] are regulated by micro circulation, which is strictly  dependent on the local presence of NO [ 6 ,  14 ]. In turn,  only   $30\%$   of rCBF is contributed by major arterial vessels.  Therefore, it has been concluded that brain ischemia can  easily occur without evidence of visible spasm in conductive arteries and that, in turn, if micro circulation remains  patent, a measurable spasm will not necessarily lead to a  cerebral infarction [ 15 ,  39 ,  40 ]. The relevance of microcirculatory disorders has also been supported by the finding that the complete elimination of detectable spasms in  the macro circulation by a selective endothelin receptor  antagonist (c la zo sent an) did not improve outcomes or  the delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) rate and decreased  the rate of vasospasm-associated infarcts only marginally  [ 41 ,  42 ]. Moreover, brain vessels feature a basal constrictive tone (39) that must be continuously counteracted by  NO. Consequently, a lack of NO affects the CBF at both  the micro- and macro-level after aSAH [ 4 ,  7 ,  13 ].  

Aside from va so regulatory tasks, NO also regulates  platelet activity, which explains why NO deficiency can  lead to micro embolism, particularly in (cortical) end vessels. This mechanism has been suggested as a possible  cause of thrombosis and infarction s [ 43 ,  44 ].  

Mol si domine  is a NO donor with unique and favorable  p harm a co dynamic and p harm a co kinetic profile characteristics. The active component of Mol si domine is SIN-1,  which is cleaved in the liver. The release of NO from SIN-1  takes place by spontaneous decomposition; the metabolites are p harm a co logically inactive, and when applied  at a clinical dose, SIN-1 does not display toxicity, has no  known relevant plasma protein binding ability or associated interactions, and does not accumulate. Mol si domine  has a linear dose–effect and a large therapeutic dose range  and has been used in the treatment of coronary heart  diseases for the prophylaxis of coronary spasms for several years. Moreover, its use does not lead to any relevant  compromise of systemic he mo dynamics. It can be applied  intravenously and does not evoke tolerance. Dosage  adjustment is not required in cases with liver or kidney  impairment or congestive heart failure [ 45 – 48 ].  

The main effect of SIN-1 is to increase the intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentration.  This induces the relaxation of arterioles and large venous  and arterial vessels independent of the endothelium, a  decrease in the tone of smooth vascular muscles, the  concentration-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation, and the release of platelet-derived vasoactive compounds. SIN-1 increases nitrite/nitrate levels and inhibits  adenosine, thrombin, serotonin, collagen and “plateletactivating factor” [ 45 ,  46 ,  49 ].
