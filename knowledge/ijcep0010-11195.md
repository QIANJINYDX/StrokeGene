Abstract:  The tetra t rico peptide repeat domain protein 39B gene ( TTC39B ) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  of rs581080 has been associated with serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. However, little is  known about such association in the Chinese populations. The present study was performed to assess the association between the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP and serum lipid levels and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and  ischemic stroke (IS) in the Guangxi Han population. Genotypes of the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP in 1741 unrelated  subjects (CAD, 578; IS, 537; and healthy controls; 624) were determined by the Snapshot Technology. The genotypic  and allelic frequencies of the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP were different between the CAD/IS patients and controls   ${\cal P}<$    0.01 for all). The CG/GG genotypes and G allele were associated with an increased risk of CAD   $P=0.001\$   for CG/ GG  vs . CC,  $P=0.003\$   for G  vs . C) and IS   $P=0.002\$   for CG/GG  vs . CC;  $P=0.004\$   for G  vs . C). The CG/GG genotypes  in the healthy controls, but not in CAD or IS patients, were also associated with a decreased serum HDL-C concentration. These results suggest that the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP is associated with the risk of CAD and IS in our study  population. It is likely to increase the risk of CAD and IS by reducing serum HDL-C levels.

# Introduction  

Both coronary artery disease (CAD) and isch- emic stroke (IS) have been recognized as widespread causes of death and disability for more  than a century [1-3]. More than 700,000 people die from CAD each year in China [4]. The  major path o physiology mechanisms of the two  diseases are atherosclerosis [5], which is a  chronic process characterized by the deposition of excessive cholesterol in the arterial inti- ma [6], and an ambitious inflammatory disorder. CAD and IS are complex and multi factorial  disorders resulted from the joint effects of multiple environmental factors including gender,  time to life, hyper lipid emi a, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, and genetic background [7-10]. A large number of genes and loci  associated with CAD [11] or IS [12] were reported in previous genome-wide association studies (GWASes). In addition, some genetic variants initially associated with CAD were detected  to be related to IS soon afterwards [13, 14].  

Resent GWASes have identified multiple novel  loci associated with serum lipid levels in the  European population [15, 16], including a single  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of rs581080 in  the tetra t rico peptide repeat domain protein  39B gene ( TTC39B ). The relevant studies [15- 17] have showed that the  TTC39B  rs581080  SNP can regulate serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels   $(P=3\times10^{.10}$   for  genotype-HDL-C association and   $P=\,3\,\times\,10^{.8}$    for genotype-expression association). Knock-down of the mouse orthologue  TTC39B  via a  viral vector, with   $50\%$   knockdown of transcript  as determined by qRT-PCR, resulted in significantly higher plasma HDL-C levels at four days   $(\varOmega9\%)$   and seven days   $(\mathbb{1}4\%)$   [15].  TTC39B  also  promotes the ubiquitin ation and degradation of  the Liver X receptor (LXR), transcription factor  of which remains a target of interest because of  its anti-a the rogen ic, cholesterol removal and  anti-inflammatory activities [18]. Therefore,  TTC39B  may be appropriate candidate as gene  to elevate HDL-C concentrations and affect the  risk of CAD and IS. Studies showed that the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP had been associated  with serum HDL-C levels. However, little is  known about such association in the Chinese  populations. In addition, the association of the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP with CAD and IS has  never been detected before. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to assess the  association of the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP and  serum lipid levels and the risk of CAD and IS in  the Chinese population.  

# Materials and methods  

Cases  

A total of 1,117 unrelated patients with CAD ( n   $\l=578)$   and IS   $(n\,=\,539)$  ) were recruited from  hospitalized patients in the First Affiliated  Hospital, Guangxi Medical University from  September 2009 to October 2011. CAD was  defined as coronary ang io graphic findings (significant coronary stenosis   $(\geq50\%)$   in at least  either one of the three main coronary arteries  or their major branches (branch diameter  $\geq2$    mm). Subjects with a history of he mato logic,  neoplastic, renal, liver, thyroid, autoimmune  diseases and type I diabetes mellitus were  excluded. Patients with CAD who had congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease was also excluded. The group of patients  with IS accepted strict neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) scan. IS was diagnosed according to the  International Classification of Diseases (9 th   Revision). The patients with IS who had embolic  brain infarction, transient ischemic attack,  stroke caused by inflammatory diseases, cardioembolic stroke, as well as a past history of  CAD were excluded from the study.  

Controls  

A total of 624 healthy subjects matched by age,  gender, and ethnic group (Han Chinese) were  consecutively recruited as a control group from  the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical  University during the same period when IS and  CAD patients were recruited. The controls were  free of IS, CAD and other diseases by questionnaires, history taking and clinical examination.  All enrolled individuals were Han Chinese from  Guangxi, the People’s Republic of China. A standard questionnaire was used to ascertain the  general information and medical history for all  participants. The study protocol was approved  by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated  Hospital, Guangxi Medical University (No. Lun-shen 2009-Guike-018; Jan. 7, 2009). Informed  consent was obtained from all subjects after  they received a full explanation of the study  [19].  

# Genotyping and biochemical analysis  

Venous blood sample was obtained from all  subjects after at least 12 hours of fasting.  Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was  extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes  using the phenol-chloroform method. Genot-yping of the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP was performed by the Snapshot technology platform in  the Center for Human Genetics Research,  Shanghai Genesky Bio-Tech Co. Ltd., China. The  rest irc tion enzyme for the  TTC39B  rs581080  SNP was SAP (Promega) and Exon ucl easel  (Epicentre). The sense and antisense primers  were 5’-T GCC TTC TC TAAG GC ACC T ACCA-3’ and  5’-T GCC AAA TTT ACT TTT GT CCC T CAC-3’, respec- tively. The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC),  triglyceride (TG), HDL-C, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in samples were  determined by enzymatic methods with commercially available kits. Serum apo lipoprotein  (Apo) A1 and ApoB levels were detected by the  immuno turbid i metric immuno as say.  

# Diagnostic criteria  

The normal values of serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDLC, ApoA1, ApoB levels, and the ratio of ApoA1 to  ApoB in our Clinical Science Experiment Center  were 3.10-5.17, 0.56-1.70, 0.91-1.81, 2.70-

 3.20 mmol/L, 1.00-1.78,   $0.63{\scriptstyle\cdot1}.14~\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{L}$  , and 

 1.00-2.50; respectively [20, 21]. The individu-als with   $\mathsf{T C}>5.17$   mmol/L, and/or   $\mathsf{T G}>1.70$    mmol/L were defined as hyper lipid emi c. Hy-pertension was diagnosed according to the criteria of 1999 World Health Organization In-ter national Society of Hypertension Guidelines  for the management of hypertension [22].  Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as a  systolic blood pressure of  $140\ \mathsf{m m H g}$   or higher  and/or a diastolic blood pressure of   $90~\mathsf{m m H g}$    or higher. Normal weight, overweight and obesity were defined as a body mass index (BMI)  $<$    24, 24-28, and  $>28\;\mathsf{k g}/\mathsf{m}^{2}$  ; respectively [23].

The value of triglyceride was presented as median (interquartile range),  the difference between CAD/IS patients and controls was determined by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The remaining charact eris tics between patients and controls were tested by the Student’s unpaired  t -test.  

# Statistical analyses  

The statistical analyses were carried out using  the statistical software package SPSS 22.0  (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). The standard  goodness-of-fit test was used to test the HardyWeinberg equilibrium. A chi-square analysis  was used to evaluate the difference in genotype distribution between the groups. The general characteristics between patients and controls were tested by the Student’s unpaired  t -test. The association of genotypes and serum  lipid parameters was tested by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Sex, age, BMI, blood pressure, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking  were adjusted for the statistical analysis. Odds  ratio (OR) and  $95\%$   confidence interval (CI) were  calculated using unconditional logistic regression. A two-tailed   $P$   value less than 0.05 was  considered statistically significant.  

# Results  

# General characteristics and serum lipid levels  

The baseline characteristics of the patients  with CAD or IS and the controls are shown in  Table 1 . The average age, male to female ratio,  serum LDL-C and ApoB levels were similar  between the controls and CAD patients and  between the controls and IS patients   $(P>0.05)$  .  As compared with control group, more patients  in CAD or IS groups had significant higher  weight, pulse pressure, BMI, systolic blood  pressure, the percentages of subjects who  smoked cigarettes and TG levels; and lower levels of TC, HDL-C, ApoA1 and the ratio of ApoA1  to ApoB   $(P<0.05)$  ). In addition, the CAD patients  had lower levels of diastolic blood pressure, the  percentages of subjects who consumed alcohol than the controls   $(P<0.05)$  . In contrast, the  IS patients had higher levels of diastolic blood  pressure, the percentages of subjects who consumed alcohol than the controls   $(P<0.05)$  ).  

Genotypic and allelic frequencies  

The frequency of the C and G alleles was  $89.2\%$  and   $\pm0.8\%$   in the controls,  $84.9\%$   and  $\pm5.1\%$   in  the CAD patients   $P=0.002$    vs . controls), and   $85.1\%$   and   $14.9\%$   in the IS patients   $(P=0.004\$  vs . controls); respectively ( Table 2 ). The frequency of the CC, CG and GG genotypes was 

  $78.5\%$  ,   $19.6\%$   and   $\pm.9\%$   in the controls,  $70.1\%$  , 

  $28.5\%$   and   $1.4\%$   in the CAD patients   $\bar{P}=0.00\bar{\perp}$  vs . controls), and  $70.5\%$  ,  $28.0\%$   and  $\pm1.5\%$   in the

Stratified analysis showed an  increased risk of CAD in subjects with the CG/ GG genotypes, mainly in those who belonged to  one of the following subgroups: males (adjusted   $\mathsf{O R}\,=\,\bot.690$  ,   $95\%~{\sf C l}\;=\;1.251.2.285$  ,   $P\,=$    0.001), age  $>60$   years (adjusted  $\mathsf{O R}=1.686$  ,   $95\%~{\sf C l}\,=\,\bot.185{\cdot}2.399$  ,   $P=0.004,$  ),   ${\sf B M I}\,>\,24$

The  rs581080 SNP was also significantly interacted  with hypertension on the risk of CAD and IS   $(P<$    0.01 for each;  Table 3 ).  

Related risk factors for CAD and IS  

Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the  incidence of CAD and IS was positively correlated with smoking, BMI, rs581080CG/GG and  hypertension and negatively correlated with the  alcohol consumption ( Table 4 ).

# Discussion  

Despite therapeutic ad-  vances that control many  risk factors, such as LDLC, to levels lower than  previously possible, de-ath from cardiovascular  disease continues to in-crease worldwide. Stati-ns have reduced the risk  of complications and de-ath from cardiovascular  causes by only approximately one third, leaving  the remaining two thirds  of patients unprotect-  ed [24]. Accordingly, the  quest for p harm a co logic  agents that target other  steps in at hero genesis  has intensified in recent  years. The  TTC39B  has  been considered to be   a promising drug target  for therapeutic intervention against hyperlipid- emia and at hero scl erosis. However, whether  the  TTC39B  inhibition  will serve as an effective  drug target for controlling atherosclerosis is  under debate. Therefore,  the genetic evidences  for an association be-tween the  TTC39B  SNP  and atherosclerosis in  humans still needs to  been clarified.  

Teslovich et al. [15] performed a GWAS of plasma lipids in more than  100,000 individuals of

TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol;  ApoA1, apo lipoprotein A1; ApoB, apo lipoprotein B. The value of triglyceride was presented as median (interquartile range), and  the difference between the two genotype subgroups was determined by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The association of  genotypes and the remaining serum lipid parameters was tested by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  

European ancestry and identified rs581080, a  SNP in the  TTC39B  on chromosome 9q22, as  having an effect on HDL-C concentrations with  an effect size of   ${\cdot0.65~\mathsf{m g}}$   per deciliter and a   $P$    value of  $3\times10^{.12}$  . In liver, the allele associated  with decreased expression and correlated with  increased HDL-C. Consistent with aforementioned discovery, knockdown of the mouse  orthologue  TTC39B via  a viral vector, with   $50\%$    knockdown of transcript as determined by q  RT-PCR, resulted in significantly higher plasma  HDL-C levels at four days   $(\varOmega9\%)$  ) and seven days   $(\varDelta4\%)$  . In the present study, we found that the  rs581080G allele carriers had lower HDL-C levels in heathy controls. These data suggest that  the  TTC39B  variants may be associated with  increased TTC39B protein expression and influence cellular cholesterol efflux, thereby playing  an important role in atherosclerosis progression. Thus, we infer that the  TTC39B  rs581080  SNP is associated with the risk of CAD and IS.  As far as we know, the association between the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP and the risk of atherosclerosis has not been reported previously.  

The prevalence of the  TTC39B  rs581080G  allele may be different in diverse racial/ethnic  groups. The information in the International  HapMap Project’s database showed that the  rs581080G allele frequency was   $\pm9.1\%$   in  Europeans,   $6.6\%$   in Han Chinese in Beijing  (HCB),   $9.1\%$   in Japanese, and   $60.0\%$   in SubSaharan African. In the present study, we  showed that the  TTC39B  rs581080G allele frequency was higher in our study subjects (control,   $10.8\%$  ; CAD,  $\pm5.1\%$  ; and IS,   $14.9\%$   than in  HCB   $(6.6\%)$  . The reason for these differences is  not well known, a reasonable explanation is different genetic background between the HCB  and Han Chinese in Guangxi. These inconsistent results, however, also suggest that the  prevalence of the  TTC39B  rs581080 variation  may have a racial/ethnic specificity. The prevalence of the rs581080G allele was higher in  Europeans than in Chinese. All of these findings  would be a reasonable explanation for the distinct prevalence of CAD between European and  Chinese.  

In the present study, we showed that the frequencies of the CG/GG genotypes and G allele  were associated with an increased risk of CAD  and IS. Multivariate analysis showed that  known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and hyper lipid emi a, were independently  associated with CAD and IS. Additionally, the  TTC39B  rs581080 CG/GG genotypes were  also associated with an increased risk of CAD  and IS after adjusting for potential confounding  factors. In the stratified analysis, an increased  risk of CAD and IS in subjects with the CG/GG  genotype was mainly observed in males, aged   $>60$   years, non-drinkers,  ${\mathsf{B M I}}>24~{\mathsf{k g}}/{\mathsf{m}}^{2}$   and  those with hypertension. In addition, an  increased risk of CAD in subjects with the   $\mathsf{C G}/$  GG genotype was also noted in smokers.  Significant interaction between the SNP and  hypertension on the risk of CAD and IS was also  observed, suggesting gene-environment interactions contributed to the risk of CAD and IS. A  previous study showed that the  TTC39B - knockout mice displayed increased HDL-C levels and increased LXR protein [18]. It is well  known that HDL-C is able to extract excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transfer  this cholesterol to the liver for biliary excretion  and is a protective factor for CAD. In addition,  LXR activity is critical for ph y sio logic lipid  metabolism and transport. Elimination of LXR  activity in bone marrow-derived cells mimicked  many aspects of Tangier disease, a human high  density lipoprotein deficiency, including aberrant regulation of cholesterol transporter ex-pression, lipid accumulation in macrophages,  spl en omega ly, and increased atherosclerosis.  Another study proved that the  TTC39B  rs581080 allele associated with decreased  expression correlated with increased HDL-C in  liver. In the present study, we showed that the  rs581080G allele carriers had lower serum  HDL-C levels than the G allele non-carriers.  These data infer that the rs581080 mutation  may increase the TTC39B expression resulting  in serum HDL-C decrease, LXR activity increase,  and add the risk of at hero sclerotic disease.  

As multi factorial diseases, both CAD and IS  shared common risk factors, such as hypertension, dys lipid emi a, metabolic syndrome [25],  and the common path oph y sio logic mechanisms atherosclerosis [24]. Atherosclerosis is a  very complex disease process with a number of  important cellular contributors, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and immune  cells (monocyte and T cells) [26-28]. Traditional  risk factors result in atherosclerosis by disrupting the function of these cells [28, 29]. Many  hypotheses have been proposed to explain the  underlying mechanisms of the initiation, progression and rupture of at hero sclerotic plaque.  The major points of these hypotheses include  the following: (i) lipoprotein retention; (ii) endothelial dysfunction; (iii) immune and inflammation response of the artery; (iv) vascular smooth  muscle cell proliferation; (v) lipid absorption by  macrophages and vascular smooth muscle  cells and the formation of foam cells; and (vi)  platelet activation and thrombosis [30, 31].  Epidemiological studies in families and twins  have showed genetic factor to the risk of CAD  and IS in humans, the gene variants involved in  these pathways of atherosclerosis could have  an effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease.  More than 300 candidate genes for CAD has  been found in the CAD gene database [30].  While a single gene or gene region only explains  a small part of the risk of at hero sclerotic disease, more large association studies, including  more target genes, are needed to assess the  risk of cardiovascular disease.  

Several potential limitations cannot be ignored.  First, compared to many GWASes and replication studies, our sample numbers were relatively small. With these situations, larger sample numbers are needed to determine the  consequences in future studies. Significant distinctions from demography were observed  between the control and patient groups. For  the sake of statistical analysis accuracy, we  adjusted for several environmental exposures,  including time to life, sex, BMI, cigarette smoking, and alcohol drinking, but the potential influence of these factors on serum lipid concentrations and the risk of CAD and IS could not be  completely eliminated. In addition, because  many subjects were taking lipid-lowering drugs,  it was not proper to analyze the association of  the SNP and serum lipid levels in the CAD and  IS groups.  

# Conclusions  

The results of the present study showed that  there was significant association between the  TTC39B  rs581080 SNP and the risk of CAD and  IS. The  TTC39B  rs581080G allele carriers conferred a decreased serum HDL-C levels and an  increased risk of CAD and IS. The CG/GG genotypes interacted with hypertension to contribute the risk of CAD and IS. Our findings should  be important to help clarifying the role of the  TTC39B  SNP in atherosclerosis.
