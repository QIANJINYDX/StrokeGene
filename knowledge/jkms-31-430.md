# Interleukin-6 Receptor Polymorphisms Contribute to the  Neurological Status of Korean Patients with Ischemic Stroke  

To investigate the contribution of the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) gene single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) to the neurological status of Korean patients with ischemic stroke  (IS), two SNPs of the IL-6R gene (rs4845617, 5 UTR; rs2228144, Ala31Ala) were selected.  IS patients were classified into clinical phenotypes according to two well-defined scores:  the National Institutes of Health Stroke Survey (NIHSS) and the Modified Barthel Index  scores. There were 121 IS patients and 291 control subjects. The SNP rs4845617  significantly contributed to the neurological status of patients with IS   $\left(P=0.011\right)$   in  codominant model 2,  $P=0.006$   in recessive model, and   $P=0.008$   in log-additive model).  Allele frequencies of rs4845617 and rs2228144 demonstrated no significant difference in IS  patients and controls. The AG and GG haplotypes differed between the NIHSS 1 (NIHSS  scores   $<\mathsf{6}$  ) group and the NIHSS 2 (NIHSS scores   $\geq6$  ) group in patients with IS   $\left(P=0.014\right.$  ,  $P\,{=}\,0.0024$  ). These results suggest that rs4845617 of the IL-6R gene is  associated with the neurologic status of Korean patients with IS.

which is associated with many other cytokines. If IL-6 binds to  IL-6R, this complex binds to GP130, leading to intracellular sig­ naling cascades (16). IL-6 performs as the main stimulator of Creactive protein (CRP) production, the levels of which are known  to be associated with metabolic syndromes such as obesity and  diabetes, as well as with vascular events (17). As an extension of  the study of IL-6R, IL-6, and CRP in stroke, the role of IL-6R needs  to be elucidated. To our knowledge, there is no study about the  associations between IL-6R polymorphisms and ischemic stroke  (IS).  

# INTRODUCTION  

Despite the recent advancements in prevention and treatment  of stroke, stroke remains the leading cause of disability and the  fifth leading cause of death in the US. Especially in those older  than 65 years, stroke is a leading cause of death and disability.  In the future, due to rapid aging, stroke will have a larger socioeconomic influence (1). Therefore, to aid in prevention, the iden­ tification of markers of stroke risk is important. Although stroke  has been believed to be a multi factorial disorder with minimal  classical patterns of inheritance, accumulating evidence has  shown the importance of genetic factors in stroke. Especially, it  has been reported that a number of inflammatory mechanisms  play a fundamental part in stroke (2); thus, various inflamma­ tory genes showing an association with stroke have received at­ tention as candidate genes (3-11). Also, genetic factors could  have an effect on stroke onset, infarct size, and prognosis (12,13).  Although several candidate genes have been studied as risk fac­ tors for stroke, there are few useful markers for the prevention,  diagnosis, and treatment of stroke (14,15).  

Disability after stroke is assessed through formal observation.  The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a neu­ rologic impairment assessment tool that provides an objective  quantified measurement in stroke patients (18,19). Higher scores  on NIHSS indicate greater stroke severity. In a previous IL-6 poly­ morphism study, patients with severe disability   $\left(\mathrm{NHSS}\ \geq6\right)$    were associated with a specific genotype (20). Stroke rehabilita­ tion outcomes are usually assessed using the Modified Barthel  Index (MBI), which is a validated tool scoring independent dai­ ly living (21).  

The aim of this study was to assess whether single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL-6R gene were associated with  the development, neurologic status, and clinical features of isch­ emic stroke in the Korean population.  

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine that regu­ lates survival and differentiation of neuronal cells. This cytokine  plays a substantial role in the immune system. The counterpart,  interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) complex consists of IL-6R and  the interleukin 6 signal transducer (IL6ST/GP130/IL-6 beta),  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

All participants with stroke were patients who visited the De­ partments of Rehabilitation Medicine at Kyung Hee Medical  Center and Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong. Healthy  control subjects were recruited from a general health check-up.  IS patients were diagnosed based on magnetic resonance (MR)  imaging, computed tomography (CT), or angiography. Exclu­ sion criteria were ischemic heart disease or other causes of cere­ bro vascular events such as traumatic brain injury, transient isch­ emic attack, and vascular malformation, etc. The NIHSS and  MBI scored were measured in the IS patients.  

Peripheral blood samples were collected from the subjects,  and genomic DNA extraction was performed using a QIAamp ®   DNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). The genotypes of  the two selected SNPs ware determined by direct sequencing  (MACROGEN, Seoul, Korea). The following primers were used in  the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification: rs4845617  (forward   $5^{\prime}$  -CT G TTC T CCCC GC TC A GG TG CG $\cdot3^{\prime}$  , reverse  $5^{\prime}$  -  A GAG GC G GAC A GG CTA AT G-3´) and rs2228144 (forward   $5^{\prime}$  -  GTA GCC T GG GCC ACT T CAT CA T-3´, reverse  $5^{\prime}$  -GACCTCTGA­ GG CACA ACT CAC-3´).  

PCR consisted of 40 cycles at   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 seconds,  $58^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30  seconds,  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 seconds, and 1 cycle at  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 5 minutes.  An ABI PRISM 3730XL analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster  City, CA, USA) sequenced the PCR products, and SeqManII soft­ ware (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA) was used to analyze the  sequencing data (22).  

To obtain odds ratios (ORs),   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs),  and   $P$   values adjusted for age and sex as covariates, SNPAnalyz­ er Pro (ISTECH, Goyang, Korea), Helixtree (Golden Helix, Boz­ eman, MT, USA), and SNPStats (http://bioinfo.icon co logia.net/ index.php? module  $=$  Snpstats) were used. The  $\chi^{2}$   test was used  to determine Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). A multiple  logistic regression analysis was adjusted for age and sex. In terms  of increasing risk of disease, an increased specific allele frequen­ cy was noted in IS patients compared with the allele frequency  of controls. To analyze the association between a polymorphism  and disease, a contingency table and  $\chi^{2}$   test were applied using  a pre specified genetic model. The codominant model was the  most general model “where the disease risk associated with AB  individuals lies between that of AA and BB individuals. In dom­ inant model, with the hypothesis that carrying allele B increased  risk of disease (dominant model), the AB and BB genotypes are  pooled giving a  $2^{*}2$   table. Alternatively, under a recessive mod­ el for allele B, cells AA and AB would be pooled. Additive model  is assumed that increased disease risk of  γ  for AB genotypes and   $2\,\gamma$  for BB genotypes” (23). In this study, codominant model 1  compared major allele homozygotes with heterozygotes, and  codominant model 2 compared major allele homozygotes with  minor allele homozygotes.  

To determine the haplotypes between the two SNPs and the  clinical features in patients with IS, Haploview version 4.2 (Daly  Lab, Cambridge, MA, USA) was used.  

The statistical significance level was set at   $P<0.05$  .  

# Ethics statement  

The study was approved by the institutional review board of  Medical Research Institute, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee Uni­ versity and Center, and Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gang­ dong (IRB No. KMC-IRB-761-09, KHNMC-IRB-2007-020). In­ formed consent was obtained from all patients before inclusion  in the study.  

# RESULTS  

There were 121 IS patients   $(\mathrm{mean}\pm\mathrm{SD},$  ,   $65.7\pm12.1$   years) and  291 controls (mean  $\pm\,\mathrm{SD},$  ,   $63.0\pm9.3$   years). The total IS group  consisted of 68 males and 53 females. The control group con­ sisted of 152 males and 140 females. There was a difference in  mean age between IS patients and control subjects, but it was  not significant   $\left(P=0.30\right)$  ). Therefore, we adjusted the statistical  results for age and gender. IS patients were classified into two  subgroups according to NIHSS score (NIHSS 1, NIHSS score 

  $<6;$  ; and NIHSS 2, NIHSS score   $\geq6$  ) and MBI score (MBI 1, MBI 

  $\le60$  ; and MBI 2, MBI score   $>60$  ). The numbers of IS patients  with NIHSS score   $<6$   and   $\geq6$   were 56 and 57, respectively. The  characteristics of the IS and control groups are shown in Table  1. The numbers of IS patients with MBI score   $\le60$   and   $>60$   were  71 and 25, respectively (data not shown).  

The genotype and allele frequencies of the two examined SNPs  are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Two SNPs (rs4845617,  5TUR; rs2228144, Ala31Ala) of the IL-6R gene were in HWE in  the IS and control groups, respectively (  $\!\!P>0.05,$  , data not shown).  The genotype and allele frequencies of the two SNPs demon­ strated no significant difference in IS cases and controls (Table  2). As shown in Table 3, the SNP rs4845617 was associated with  the NIHSS score of IS patients (  $P=0.011$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}=0.24$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=$   

 0.08-0.72 in codominant model 2,  $P=0.006$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}=0.30$  ,   $95\%$   

  $\mathrm{{CI}=0.12{-}0.74}$   in recessive model, and  $P=0.008$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}=0.48$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.28–0.84$   in log-additive model). In SNP rs4845617, the  frequencies of genotype according to NIHSS score was signifi­ cantly different in the codominant model 2, recessive model,

and log-additive model, and the A allele frequency was signifi­ cantly higher in the NIHSS 1 group of IS patients. However, in  SNP rs2228144, the genotype and allele frequencies did not cor­ relate with the NIHSS score of the IS group (Table 3). Further­ more, rs4845617 and rs2228144 had no correlation with MBI  score in the IS group (data not shown).  

We investigated the associations between haplotypes of con­ trol subjects and IS patients and NIHSS score. The haplotype  frequencies of the two SNPs were not significantly different be­ tween control subjects and IS patients (Table 4). However, as  shown in Table 5, the AG and GG haplotypes differed between

the NIHSS 1 and NIHSS 2 groups in IS patients. The frequency  of the AG haplotype was higher in the NIHSS 1 group, and that  of the GG haplotype was higher in the NIHSS 2 group of IS pa­ tients (  $\textstyle P=0.014$  ,   $P=0.0024$  , respectively). However, the haplo­ type frequencies found no significant difference by MBI scores  (Table 6).  

# DISCUSSION  

Ischemic stroke is known to be a heterogeneous multi factorial  disease (24). Although conventional risk factors such as hyper­ tension, diabetes, dys lipid emi a and smoking account for a sig­ nificant proportion of these stroke events, a considerable por­ tion remains insufficiently explained by these factors (25,26).  As risk factors for stroke, several genetic factors have been stud­ ied; however, there are few useful markers for prevention, diag­ nosis, and treatment of stroke (26). Therefore, increasing our  understanding of risk factors including genetic components  would allow us to predict the risk better, identification of novel  stroke mechanisms, and new therapeutic approaches using ge­ netic factors (27).  

Several studies have reported the relationship between SNPs  and stroke risk in Korea. Some of these SNPs include apolipo­ protein E (3), 5-methyl tetra hydro folate-homo cyst eine methyl­ transfer as e (6), interleukin 4 (11), interleukin-1 receptor antag­ onist, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 beta (8), neuropep­ tide Y (5), peroxisome pro life rat or-activated receptor gamma  (9), ph os ph odi est erase 4D cAMP-specific chemokine (C-C mo­ tif) ligand 5 (4), thromboxane A 2 receptor, and thromboxane A  synthase 1 (platelet) (10).  

Several SNPs have been identified in the IL-6R gene, associ­ ated with carotid plaque (28), CRP (17,29) and obesity or diabe­ tes (30-33). However, there has been no study of polymorphisms  of the IL-6R gene in relation to stroke. Carotid plaque is assumed  to be associated with increased stroke risk. In a genetic study in  a Dominican population, IL-6R was suggested to be a related  gene associated with carotid plaque (28).  

Elevated CRP level predicts risk of stroke (17). IL-6 has been  shown to have a positive correlation with CRP and to predict the  risk of vascular events. The polymorphism of IL-6R gene is linked  with CRP expression and plasma IL-6 level (34). Lu Qi et al. (35)  demonstrated that the IL-6R variants (rs6684439, rs4845622,  rs8192284, rs4329505) are significantly associated with plasma  CRP level, independent of IL-6 level. In addition, the IL-6R vari­ ant interacts with CRP in relation to diabetes risk. In another  study, the IL-6R gene (rs4845617) was suggested to play an im­ portant role in the pathogen es is of dys lipid emi a and atheroscle­ rosis (36). We identified SNPs of IL-6R, in coding regions near  the promoter region, that had greater than 0.1 he ter oz y gos it y  and greater than 0.1 minor allele frequency. For rs4845617, het­ ero zy gos it y is 0.471, and minor allele frequency is 0.3804; for  rs2228144, he ter oz y gos it y is 0.208, and minor allele frequency  is 0.1178.  

This is the first report to identify an association between SNPs  of the IL-6R gene associated with risk of stroke and the clinical  features of stroke. The two SNPs (rs4845617 and rs2228144) were  not associated with development or daily activities of IS. How­ ever, our results revealed that SNP rs4845617 contributes to the  neurologic status of IS patients. The mechanisms remain of the  effects of IL-6R gene polymorphisms on stroke severity remain  unclear. Compared with previous SNPs studies, the sample size  in this study was relatively small. Therefore, other stroke risk fac­ tors analyses could be included while sample size became small­ er after dividing groups with regard to hypertension, diabetes,  dys lipid emi a, and smoking history in this study. Further studies  with larger sample size are necessary to elucidate this result.  

In summary, two SNPs of the IL-6R gene (rs4845617, rs2228144)  were analyzed in Korean ischemic stroke patients. The frequen­ cies of genotype and alleles of the two SNPs demonstrated no  significant difference in IS cases and controls. Therefore, the  two SNPs are not associated with development of IS. However,  in SNP rs4845617, the frequencies of genotypes according to  NIHSS score are statistically different, and the A allele frequen­ cy in the mild stroke patients is significantly higher than an al­ lele frequency in the severe stroke patients. This indicates that  SNP rs4845617 is associated with the neurologic status evaluat­ ed by NIHSS in patients with IS. In addition, the A allele of SNP  rs4845617 might have a protective effect against neurologic def­ icit in IS patients.
