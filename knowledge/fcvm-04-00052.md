Front. Cardiovasc. Med. 4:52.  doi: 10.3389/fcvm.2017.00052 Background:  Platelet membrane glycoprotein receptors mediate thrombus formation.  GP Ia/IIa is an essential platelet integrin receptor. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the GP Ia/IIa gene alter GP Ia/IIa expression; however, their influence on  cardiovascular disease remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of  the GP Ia/IIa SNPs rs1126643 and rs1062535 on clinical outcomes in a large collective  including high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.  

Methods and results:  GP Ia SNP analysis was performed in 943 patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease. All patients were tracked for all-cause death, myocardial  infarction, and ischemic stroke for 360 days. Homozygous carriers of the minor allele  showed significantly worse event-free survival when compared with major allele carriers  in the complete collective as well as in the subset of high-risk patients (carrying all of the  following three risk factors: diabetes type II, hypertension, and hyper lipid emi a). There  was no significant difference in the subset of low-risk patients (carrying none of the three  risk factors).  

conclusions:  GPla SNPs are associated with cardiovascular prognosis especially in  high-risk patients. Identification of GPIa SNPs is of importance to tailor therapies in  patients at already high cardiovascular risk.

# INTRODUCTION  

Platelet membrane glycoprotein receptors (GP) mediate thrombus formation leading to generation  of platelet thrombi that are involved in the development of acute ischemic events such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and ischemic stroke ( 1 ,  2 ). Among the essential platelet integrin receptors  is GP Ia/IIa (also known as integrin   $\upalpha2\upbeta1$  ). GP Ia/IIa is crucial for adhesion of platelets to collagen  type I even under high shear rates typical for arterial vessels ( 3 ,  4 ). Consequently, deficiency of  GP Ia/IIa, either acquired or congenital, leads to bleeding diathesis ( 5 ). The integrin, alpha 2 gene  (ITGA2), which is coding for GP Ia/IIa, is located on chromosome 5q23-31. A single-nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) of the ITAG2 gene, that alters GP Ia/IIa expression, has been identified as GPla  C807T (rs1126643). Carriers of the TT genotype (homozygous  carriers of minor allele) express the highest levels, CT carriers  (heterozygotes) intermediate levels, and CC carriers (homozygous carriers of major allele) the lowest levels of GPIa/IIa ( 6 ,  7 ).  A second SNP in the ITAG2 gene (rs1062535) is associated with  risk of bleeding after cardiac surgery ( 8 ). One could argue that  analogous to bleeding diathesis, elevated levels of GP Ia/IIa lead  to a higher risk of arterial thrombosis, therefore supporting the  hypothesis that carriers of the TT or CT genotype suffer from  increased incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic  stroke. Several case–control studies were launched to investigate  this hypothesis, which however led to controversial results.  Carriers of the T allele were reported to have an increased risk of  MI and ischemic stroke in some studies, whereas other studies  could not show a significant difference ( 7 ,  9 – 13 ). Santoso et al.  report that the   $\mathrm{T}807$   allele is associated with incidence of MI in  younger patients ( 9 ). Analogous to this observation, there might  be a significant influence of GP Ia SNPs on the development of  ischemic stroke in younger patients ( 14 ). On the other hand,  GP Ia rs1126643 failed to show a significant effect on the risk of  restenosis after stenting in patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) excluding patients with MI ( 15 ). The  same group showed that GP Ia rs1126643 did not have a relevant  impact on major adverse events including death, MI, and urgent  target vessel re vascular iz ation up to 30  days after coronary  stenting. A recent meta-analysis investigating 19 studies could  not find evidence supporting a positive relation between either  CAD or MI and the rs1126643 polymorphism of the ITGA2 gene  ( 16 ). One possible explanation could be given by the hypothesis  that the GP Ia rs1126643 polymorphism does not influence  development of coronary atherosclerosis as such but might  lead to increased platelet th rom bogen i city, therefore leading to  ischemic events primarily in younger patients without significant  CAD ( 17 ). Several studies indicate that GP Ia polymorphisms  are associated with adverse cardiovascular events in younger  patients, whereas little data suggest an association between GP Ia  polymorphisms and patients at high cardiovascular risk. So far,  the influence of GP Ia rs1126643 and rs1062535 on card i ovas cular disease remains a matter of debate. Hence, this study aimed  to investigate the influence of the GP Ia SNPs rs1126643 and  rs1062535 on clinical outcomes including all-cause death, MI,  and ischemic stroke in a large heterogeneous collective including  high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Subjects  

GP Ia SNP analysis was performed in a previously described  cohort of 943 consecutive patients with stable CAD and  ACS including non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and  ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( 18 ). CAD was defined as  narrowing of at least one coronary artery  ${\geq}50\%$   ( 19 ). We defined  stable CAD as a clinical syndrome characterized by discomfort  in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arms, typically elicited by  exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin  ( 20 ). ACS was defined as worsening of angina (unstable angina  pectoris) and acute MI. Arterial hypertension was defined  as   ${\geq}140\ \mathrm{mmHg}$   in systolic and   ${\ge}90~\mathrm{mmHg}$  in diastolic blood  pressure ( 21 ). Hyper lipid emi a was defined as baseline LDL   cholesterol  ${\geq}160\,\mathrm{mg/dl}$   and triglycerides  ${\geq}200\;\mathrm{mg/dl}$   ( 22 ). Diabetes  mellitus type II was defined as fasting plasma glucose  ${\geq}125\;\mathrm{mg/dl}$  or   $\mathrm{2-h}$   plasma glucose   ${\geq}200\,\mathrm{\meg/dl}$   during standardized   $75\mathrm{\cdotg}$    oral glucose tolerance test or symptoms of hyperglycemia plus  non-fasting plasma glucose  ${\geq}200~\mathrm{mg/dl}$   or HbA1c   ${\geq}6.5\%$   ( 23 ).  For subgroup analysis, we defined patients at very high cardiovascular risk suffering from all three cardiovascular risk factors  such as diabetes mellitus type II, arterial hypertension, and  hyper lipid emi a, whereas a low-risk cohort was defined as patients  suffering from none of the aforementioned risk factors. All subjects gave written informed consent. Patients were admitted to  the Department of Cardiology of the University of Tuebingen,  Germany. The study was approved by the institutional ethics  committee (Ethik-Kommission an der Me diz in ischen Fakultät  der Eberhard-Karls-Universit t und am Universit ts klin i kum  Tübingen) (270/2011BO1) and complies with the declaration   of Helsinki and the good clinical practice guidelines ( 24 – 26 ).  

# Genotyping of GP Ia Variants  

Genotyping for this GP Ia variants was performed as previously described by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization  time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using the  MassARRAY ®  Compact system (Sequenom, CA, USA) ( 18 ).  Study personnel assessing outcome was blinded to the case status  of the study participants during the entire genotyping process.  

# Follow-up  

All patients were tracked after initial PCI for clinical events  including all-cause death, MI and ischemic stroke for 360 days  after study inclusion. An acute MI was diagnosed by a rise and/or   fall of cardiac biomarker values (cardiac troponin) with at least  one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit and  with at least one of the following: symptoms of ischemia, new or  presumed new significant ST-segment–T wave changes or new  left bundle branch block, development of pathological Q waves  in the ECG, imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium  or new regional wall motion abnormality or identification of  an intra coronary thrombus by angiography ( 27 ). CNS infarction and ischemic stroke was defined as brain, spinal cord, or  retinal cell death attributable to ischemia, based on pathological,  imaging, or other objective evidence of cerebral, spinal cord,  or retinal focal ischemic injury in a defined vascular distribution; or clinical evidence of cerebral, spinal cord, or retinal  focal ischemic injury based on symptoms persisting   ${\ge}24~\mathrm{h}$   or  until death, and other etiologies excluded ( 28 ). The combined  primary endpoint consisted of either time to death, MI, or  ischemic stroke. Secondary endpoints included the single events  of all-cause death, MI, and ischemic stroke. 71 patients were  lost to follow-up   $(7.5\%)$  . The patients lost to follow-up did not  significantly differ in their baseline characteristics as compared  to the group remaining in the study (  $(n=872)$  ). Moreover, both  groups showed similar distributions regarding the analyzed GP  Ia variants. Follow-up for the primary combined endpoint (CE)  was performed until first occurrence of one of the pre-defined  endpoints. Follow-up was performed by telephone interview  and/or review of patients’ charts on read mission by investigators blinded to the results of laboratory testing. Mortality,   MI, and ischemic stroke were ascertained by investigating hospital discharge letters and telephone interview with the patients’  physician.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21.0  (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Chi-square tests and Student’s  ANOVA were applied as appropriate to analyze baseline charact eris tics. Concerning the GPIA SNPs, two different genetic  models were considered for these biallelic variants: recessive  and additive genetic model. In the recessive model, homozygote  and heterozygote carriers of the major allele are combined and  compared versus homozygote carriers of the minor allele. In the   additive model, homozygote carriers of the major allele, heterogyzotes, and homozygote carriers of the minor allele are  numerically coded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively, assuming a (linear)  allele-dose effect. The Cochran–Armitage test was performed to  test for associations between endpoints and GPIa SNPs in the  additive genetic model. Cox regression analysis was applied to  test for the association between GPIa SNPs (additive or recessive  model) and survival (CE, all-cause death, or MI), using epidemio- logical factors influencing cardiovascular outcome as co variables  (arterial hypertension, hyper lipid emi a, diabetes mellitus type II,  smoking, acetyl salicylic acid, angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitors, beta blockers, statins, age, gender, left ventricular  ejection fraction, and reason of admission). The time-dependent  covariate method was used to check the proportional hazard  assumption of the model. Survival functions were estimated by  Kaplan–Meier curves. The log-rank test was applied to compare  survival functions between homozygote carriers of major allele  and carriers of the minor allele (i.e., recessive model). All statistical tests were two-sided and statistical significance level was  defined as   $5\%$  .  

# RESULTS  

GPIa variants rs1126643 and rs1062535 were highly linked in our  cohort (  $\mathcal{D}^{\prime}=0.996$  ,   $r=0.994$  ). Hence, throughout this article,  results are only presented and discussed for rs1126643.  

Patients’ characteristics (age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, co-medication) of the cohort   $\acute{n}=943\AA$  ), with and without  stratification according to rs1126643, are provided in  Table 1 . Table 2  

Number and categories of events are shown in  .  

All patients were followed up after initial PCI. By using an  additive genetic model, we could not find significant associations between rs1126643 and the CE or the secondary endpoints  in the overall cohort ( Table  2 ). Rs1126643 was significantly  correlated with the CE in patients who suffered from diabetes  type II, arterial hypertension, and hyper lipid emi a (defined as  high-risk cohort), but not in patients without any of these risk  factors (defined as low-risk cohort) (see  Table  3 ). However,  power of these analyses was low due to limited number of cases  (  $\dot{n}=163$   and  $n=83$  , respectively) and low event rate.

Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that rs1126643  was not significantly associated with the CE as well as MI  after adjustment for epidemiological factors, using an additive  genetic model ( Table 4 ). However, in the recessive genetic model   (i.e., comparing carriers of major allele versus homozygous  carrier of minor allele), we could find significant independent  associations between the GPIa   $\mathrm{C}807\mathrm{T}$   variants and both, the  CE (hazard ratio 1.95,   $p=0.011)$  ) and MI (hazard ratio 2.11,   $p=0.028)$  ) ( Table 5 ). As shown in  Table 6,  we could find significant independent associations between the GPIa C807T variants  and the CE (hazard ratio 3.29,  $p=0.024)$   ( Table 6 ).  

In the overall cohort, patients who were homozygous carriers of the minor allele showed significantly shortened time to  event for the CE when compared with carriers of the major allele  (univariate analysis: log-rank test   $\it{\Delta}p$  -value   $=\,0.035$   for CE and  log-rank test  $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}$  -value   $=0.025$   for MI, respectively) ( Figures 1 and  2 ). The same held true in the high-risk cohort (log-rank test   $\it{\Delta}p$  -value  $=0.003$   for CE), whereas rs1126643 was not significant  associated with the CE in the low-risk cohort (log-rank test   $\it{\Delta}p$  -value  $=0.448$   for CE) ( Figure 3 ).  

# DISCUSSION  

The major finding of the present study is that GPla rs1126643  and rs1062535 polymorphisms are associated with outcomes in  patients with cardiovascular disease in particular in high-risk

patients (e.g., in patients with diabetes type II, arterial hypertension, and hyper lipid emi a).  

Glycoprotein Ia is a component of the GP Ia/IIa complex,  a collagen receptor on platelets. This complex is a member of  the integrin family and contributes to primary hemostasis after  vessel injury ( 1 ,  2 ). The SNP GPIa C807T might alter expression  levels of the GP Ia/IIa receptor on the platelet surface, therefore  possibly influencing hazard of the patient for thr ombo ischaemic  events ( 6 ,  7 ). The hypothesis that GPIa C807T polymorphisms  might affect thr ombo embo li c complications in patients with  cardiovascular disease led to a number of studies. However,  available data provide conflicting results. A meta-analysis by  Tsantes et al. could not find evidence supporting an association  of both, CAD and MI with the C807T polymorphism ( 16 ).   In this meta-analysis, studies were included that investigated the  impact of the polymorphism on a cross-sectional basis comparing patients with first onset of CAD and/or MI with a control  group in a general population, or subjects in a hospital or a clinic  showing no manifestation or having no history of CAD. In our  study, we did not aim to investigate associations of GP Ia C807T  polymorphisms with primary onset of CAD since most of our  patients already suffered from CAD at study inclusion. We could  show that GP Ia polymorphisms are significantly associated with  recurrent events, i.e., a composite endpoint of all-cause death,  Table 5  | Cox regression analysis for the combined endpoint (CE) and  myocardial infarction (MI) as dependent variable, rs1126643 (recessive genetic  model) as independent variable, and clinical factors as covariates in the overall  cohort of cardiovascular patients   $(n=870)$  ).

MI, and/or ischemic stroke as well as the single endpoint MI.  Interestingly, as shown with  post hoc  tests, the incidence rates  did not correlate with the number of T-alleles as suggested by  increasing GP Ia/IIa receptor density depending on the number  of T-alleles. We could not find a significant increase in endpoints  in dependence of the number of T-alleles. Thus, our results  suggest that an increase of GPIa/IIa receptor density does not  necessarily result in an increase of thrombo ischemic events

even though homozygous carriers of the minor allele showed an  increase in events when compared to both, homozygous carriers  of the major allele and heterozygous carriers of the minor allele.  A possible explanation for these unexpected findings might  be a study collective that differs in their risk for developing  thr ombo embo li c events by differential manifestations of thrombo inflammation. However, after adjusting for risk factors, the GP  Ia polymorphisms remained independently associated with the  CE as well as MI. Of note, we found the strongest association in  patients with a very high cardiovascular risk profile. It is tempting  to speculate that the prognostic role of the GP Ia polymorphisms  increases with the baseline cardiovascular risk of the patients.  Recently, it was discovered that GPIa rs1126643 T-allele carriage  increases risk of MACCE after coronary artery bypass surgery.  The patient collective in this study suffered to a large extent of  3-vessel disease   $(88\%)$   and several cardiovascular risk factors  (hypertension  $67\%$  , hyper lipid emi a   $68\%$  , and diabetes mellitus   $33\%$  ), which predestines them for future cardiovascular events.  Patients with hypertension showed a significantly increased  rate of major adverse cardiovascular events when compared  to patients without hypertension ( 29 ). Heeschen et  al. have  previously shown that elevated levels of soluble CD40 ligand  (sCD40L), which is released after platelet activation, are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with  CAD ( 30 ). This is interesting because the T-allele of rs1126643  has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor for the  release of   $\mathrm{sCD40L}$   during the acute phase of MI, an effect that  persisted in the same patients 1 year after the event. The same  study group showed that the presence of the rs1126643 T-allele  was associated with increased levels of   $s\mathrm{{CD40L}}$   in healthy subjects, but only in the presence of high vWF levels ( 31 ). However,  these results could not be confirmed in a subsequent study of  a different group ( 32 ). Furthermore, GP Ia polymorphisms  could therefore be used to identify patients that would benefit  from a more stringent secondary prophylaxis, e.g., prolonging  the duration of dual anti platelet therapy beyond 12  months  after stent implantation in ACS patients. It has been previously  demonstrated that risk of ischemic stroke is associated with the  expression of the T807 allele ( 14 ). In our study, we could not  show a difference in the incidence of ischemic stroke according  to GP Ia C807T SNPs, probably explained by the small number  of events. Santoso et al. found an association between MI and the  presence of the T807 allele. However, this association was only  significant when the authors investigated patients below the age  of 62 years ( 9 ). In our study, we can demonstrate an association  between MI and GP Ia SNPs in a heterogeneous patient collective  with cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, homozygous carriers  of the minor allele showed the highest event rate of MI.  

To summarize, our study investigated an association of the  GP Ia polymorphisms with outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. We could find a significant association of the  GP Ia polymorphisms with the CE and the single endpoint MI.  We found the strongest associations in patients at very high  cardiovascular risk. These findings remained significant after  adjustment for risk factors.  

Thus, the role of the GP Ia/IIa polymorphisms for the prognosis of cardiovascular disease remains a matter of debate, but  might help to individualize risk-based strategies for secondary  prophylaxis especially in high-risk patients.  

# Limitations  

We are aware that our results are only hypothesis generating.  Our study has certain limitations mainly due to its observational  character, the moderate sample size, low event rate, and lost  to follow-up. Especially the subgroup analysis of the high-risk  cohort has low power due to low sample size. Furthermore,  we are fully aware that the literature research does not replace  a prospective validation study. However, we believe that the  publications mentioned in the discussion section are highly  confirm at ive for an association of distinct GPIa genetic variants  and cardiovascular events in different high-risk populations.  We did not account for other potential con founders including  biomarkers that have previously been associated with outcome  in cardiovascular cohorts. Since the study cohort consisted of  mostly Caucasian individuals, it might be difficult to generalize  the results for other ethnicities.
