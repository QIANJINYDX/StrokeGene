Methods: We examined the association between   $\mathsf{m^{6}A{-}S N P S}$   and IS in large scale GWAS. Furthermore, eQTL analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of   $\mathsf{m^{6}A{-}S N P S}$  on gene expression. The top associations between   $\mathsf{m^{6}A{-}S N P S}$   and gene expressions were validated in 40 individuals from the Chinese Han population. Besides, we applied differential expression analysis and Mendelian random iz ation (MR) analysis to detect potential causal genes for IS.

The proportion of   $\mathsf{m}^{6}\mathsf{A}\!\!-\!\mathsf{S N P S}$   with    $P\,<\,0.05$   for IS was sign i cant ly higher than the non $\mathsf{\cdot m^{6}A}$  -SNPs (  $(95\%\mathrm{C}|$  :   $[5.84\%$  ,   $7.36\%]$  ,  $P=0.02,$  ).

Conclusions:  This study showed that   $\mathsf{m^{6}A{-}S N P S}$   may affect IS risk through altering gene expressions. The results suggested that  $\mathsf{m}^{6}\mathsf{A}$   might play a role in IS etiology and gene expressions that affected by  $\mathsf{m}^{6}\mathsf{A}$   may be causal factors for IS.

# INTRODUCTION  

Ischemic stroke (IS) is the second leading cause of death worldwide ( 1 ). As a complex disease, genetic and epigenetic factors play important roles in IS etiology. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identiﬁed many loci for IS and speciﬁc subtypes, including large artery stroke (LAS), card i oem boli c stroke (CES), and small vessel stroke (SVS). A recent large-scale meta-analysis of GWAS in 521,612 individuals conﬁrmed 32 IS-associated loci which oﬀering mechanisms not previously implicated in stroke path o physiology ( 2 ). Although previous GWAS have revolutionized the understanding of the genetic architecture of IS and provided a framework for prior it iz ation of stroke risk variants and genes for further functional and experimental follow-up, ident i cation of functional variants and causal genes in the GWAS loci is not ﬁnished but still a major challenge.  

$\mathrm{N}^{6}$  -methyl adenosine   $\mathrm{(m^{6}A)}$   is a pervasive RNA modi cation that plays critical roles in mRNA stability, protein expression and several other cellular processes ( 3 ). Dys regulated   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   has been linked to cell fate during the endo the li al-to-he ma top oie tic transition ( 4 ), cardiac homeostasis ( 5 ,  6 ) and brain diseases ( 7 ). Genetic variants, i.e., the  $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$  -associated SNPs   $\mathrm{(m^{6}A{-}S N P s)}$  , can inﬂuence   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   by changing the RNA sequences of the target sites ( 8 ). If  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   modi cation was aﬀected by this kind of variants, the biological process would likely be modiﬁed, leading to under/over expression of the protein ( 8 ).  

Evaluation of the eﬀect of genetic variants on   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$  modi cation will increase our understanding of the pathogenic molecular mechanisms and uncover new causal variants. Until now, the relationship between   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   and IS has not yet been clearly deﬁned. Besides, determination of the association between  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   and IS in large sample at genome-wide scale in a large sample is hard to achieve nowadays. In this study we investigated the eﬀect of the  $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$  -SNPs on IS and showed that by using the GWAS identiﬁed IS-associated   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   as a bridge we can assess the relationship between   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   and IS indirectly. Meanwhile, we highlight some potential causal genetic variants and genes for IS.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Ident i cation of   $\mathfrak{m}^{\circ}\pmb{\mathsf{A}}.$  -SNPs for IS  

In this study, we ﬁrst investigated the eﬀect of the  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  on IS in the published summary data of a large scale GWAS ( 2 ). This GWAS comprised 521,612 individuals. Raw data used in the present analysis was the downloaded summary results from the initial GWAS, which included association  $P$   values of almost 8 million SNPs and indels for any IS (AIS) and common e tio logical subtypes of LAS, CES, and SVS. These datasets were available at the MEGASTROKE website (http://megastroke.org/).  

To screen out the   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   in these 8 million SNPs, we annotated them using a list of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   which were downloaded from the m6AVar database (http://m6avar.renlab. org/). The list contains 13,703 high, 54,222 medium and 284,089 low conﬁdence level   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   for human ( 8 ). After annotation of the SNPs in the GWAS summary dataset by the list of   $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}.$  - SNPs, we identiﬁed the   $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$  -SNPs which were associated with IS. Those   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   with    $\textit{P}<\:0.05$   were considered in the following analyses.  

Among IS-associated SNPs, we determined if   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  were overrepresented compared to what would be expected by chance. We randomly sampled 1,000 sets of non $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}\bar{S N P s}}$   (the same number of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s)}$   from the GWAS datasets for IS as matched background, and then determined if the proportion of  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   with    $\begin{array}{r l}{P\,<\,}&{{}0.05}\end{array}$   was sign i cant ly higher than the proportion of non $\mathrm{\cdotm^{6}A{\mathrm{-}}S N P s}$   with    $\textstyle P\,<\,0.05$   in the 1,000 sets for each trait. Besides, to assure that allele frequency diﬀerences between  $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$   and non $\cdot\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$  -SNPs are not driving the conclusion that there is over representation of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   in stroke cases, we selected from allele frequency bins of 1–5, 5–10, 11–20, 21– 30, 31–40, and   $41\!-\!50\%$   for each set of non $\mathrm{\cdotm^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   to more precisely mirror the distribution of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  .  

# eQTL Analysis  

The   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}.$  -SNPs may participate in gene expression regulation through exerting inﬂuence on RNA modi cation, thus they may be associated with gene expression level. We carried out the  cis -acting eQTL analysis to obtain evidence on associations between the identiﬁed   $\mathrm{\dot{m}}^{6}\mathrm{A}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{SNPS}$   and gene expressions in HaploReg (https://pubs.broad institute.org/mammals/haploreg/ haploreg.php). To validate the eQTLs we also tested genotypes and mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mono nuclear cells (PBMCs) of 40 unrelated Chinese Han individuals (age range from 27 to 67) using RT-PCR method to obtain additional evidence to support the top IS-associated   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  . PBMCs were isolated from   $15\,\mathrm{{ml}}$   peripheral blood by density gradient cent ri fuga tion using Lymphoprep (Sigma, life science, USA). Total RNA and DNA were extracted in the same lab according to the instructions recommended by the manufacturer. The study was approved by the ethical committee of Soochow University. The written informed consent was obtained from all of the participants.  

# Differential Expression Analysis  

We further tried to determine if the expression levels of genes which the IS-associated   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   showed  cis -eQTL eﬀects on were associated with IS based on the expression proﬁle data (GSE22255) available in the GEO database (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/geo). GSE22255 contained data of gene expression levels in PBMCs from 20 IS cases to 20 controls ( 9 ). Di e rent i al expression was tested by comparing mean gene expression signals between cases and controls using    $t$  -test. The sign i can ce level of  $P=0.05$   was used for the di e rent i al expression analyses.  

# Mendelian Random iz ation Analysis  

We supposed that the IS-associated   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   aﬀect gene expression and consequently cause IS. To obtain additional evidence to support this idea, we conducted a summary data– based Mendelian random iz ation (SMR) analysis ( 10 ). SMR applies the principles of MR ( 11 ,  12 ) to jointly analyze eQTL and GWAS summary statistics in order to test for association between gene expression and a trait due to a shared variant at a locus. A HEIDI (heterogeneity in dependent instruments) test for heterogeneity in the resulting association statistics was performed.    $\mathrm{\mathit{P}_{H E I D I}}\ >\ 0.05$   means that there was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity underlying the eQTL signals. The SMR software was downloaded from http://cns genomics.com/ software/  $/\mathrm{smr}/$  . Genotype data of HapMap r23 CEU was used as a reference panel to calculate the linkage d is equilibrium correlation for SMR analysis. The eQTL summary data from four studies were used in our SMR analysis. Westra et al. performed the largest eQTL meta-analysis so far in peripheral blood samples of 5,311 European healthy individuals ( 13 ). The genetic architecture of gene expression (GAGE) study detected eQTLs in peripheral blood in 2,765 European individuals ( 14 ). The cis-eQTL summary data from the GTEx whole blood ( 15 ) and brain ( 16 ) were used. Only SNPs within  $1\,\mathrm{Mb}$   of the transcription start site are available for these two GTEx datasets.  

# RESULTS  

# IS-associated   $\pmb{\mathfrak{m}}^{\circ}\pmb{\mathsf{A}}$  -SNPs  

We found about   $4{,}000~\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}{\cdot}\mathrm{SNPs}$   in each the GWAS datasets for AIS, LAS, CES, and SVS. Among these SNPs, 310   $(7.39\%)$  , 305   $(6.72\%)$  , 279   $(6.18\%)$  , and 205   $(6.26\%)$   were nominally  $(P<0.05)$   associated with AIS, LAS, CES, and SVS, respectively. The proportion of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   which have GWAS  $P\,<\,0.05$   for AIS was sign i cant ly higher than the non $\mathrm{{\cdotm^{6}A{\cdot}S N P s}}$   (  $\cdot95\%\mathrm{CI}$  :

  $[5.84\%$  ,   $7.36\%$  ],  $P=0.02$  ). But it’s not for LAS (  $\cdot95\%\mathrm{CI}$  :   $[5.55\%$  ,

  $6.94\%]$  ],    $P=0.093$  ), CES (  $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  :   $[5.45\%$  ,   $6.82\%]$  ],  $P=0.45.$  ), or SVS (  $\cdot95\%\mathrm{CI}$  :   $[5.10\%$  ,  $6.84\%$  ],  $P=0.26$  ), which were analyzed in smaller sample than AIS. In the original METASTROKE GWAS, SNPs with minor allele frequencies   $(\mathrm{MAF})\geq0.01$   were examined. Therefore, the MAF of SNPs considered in our study was    ${\geq}0.01$  . In fact, the MAF of about   $90\%$   of the 321 IS-associated SNPs were  ${\tt>}0.05$  . The distributions of MAF were not diﬀerent between  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   and non $\mathrm{\cdotm^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   with    $P\,<\,0.05$   (goodness-of-ﬁt test    $P=0.1551$  ). While selected from allele frequency bins of  $1–5\%$   (number of SNPs sampled    $n=583$  ),   $6–10\%$   (  $\acute{n}=663\AA$  ),  $11\substack{-20\%}$     $(n=1,064)$  ),   $21\!-\!30\%$   (  $\ \cdot n=\ 720)$  ),   $31–40\%$   (  $\mathit{\check{n}}=628.$  ), and   $41\!-\!50\%$   (  $\cdot n=539$  ) for each of the 1,000 sets of non $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}.$  - SNPs to mirror the distribution of  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   for AIS, we also found that the proportion of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   with    $\textsl{P}<\,0.05$   was sign i cant ly higher than the non  $\mathrm{\cdotm^{6}A{\mathrm{-}}S N P s}$   (  $\cdot95\%\mathrm{CI}$  :   $5.89\%$  ,

  $7.29\%$  ],  $P=0.014)$  ).  

We considered Bonferroni-correction for the results

 (  $\dot{P}<0.05/4000$   for roughly  $4000\;\mathrm{{SNPS}}_{3}$  ). The association between

  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   rs11559309 ( PRPF8 ,    $P\,=\,6.18~\times~10^{-6})$   and AIS reached the sign i can ce level of   $1.25~\times~10^{-5}$  , followed by rs7398833   $(P=1.78\,\times\,10^{-5})$  ) in  CUX2  gene, rs5213 (  $P=2.46$   $\times\ 10^{-5})$  ) in  KCNJ11  gene and rs10832778   $(P=4.25\,\times\,10^{-5})$  in  NCR3LG1  gene. The most signiﬁcant   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   for LAS, CES, and SVS were rs174535 (  $\bar{P=6.05\times10^{-5}})$  ) in  MYRF  gene, rs2273235   $(P=3.99\,\times\,10^{-4})$  ) in  NDST1  gene and rs1887812  $(P=4.05\times10^{-4})$  ) in  BRDT  gene ( Table 1 ;  Figure 1 ), respectively.  

# eQTL Analysis  

To further clarify the possible functional mechanisms underlying the identiﬁed   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   in association with IS, we investigated whether they were associated with gene expression levels. In total, 6 of the 15 IS-associated  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   showed  cis -eQTL signals with the 6 local genes in diﬀerent cells or tissues ( Table 1 ;  Table S1 ). The 5 IS-associated  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   (except rs10832778) might alter regulatory motifs ( 17 ) ( Table S1 ). Besides, rs7398833 ( CUX2 ) was associated with expression of  ALDH2    $(P=1.47\times10^{-5})$  ),  ATXN2

  $(P=2.74\,\times\,10^{-6})$  ),  FAM109A    $(P=3.41\,\times\,10^{-3})$  ) and  SH2B3

  $(P=1.27\times10^{-10})$  ), and rs174535 ( MYRF ) was associated with expression of  FADS1    $(P=2.37\,\times\,10^{-31}$  ),  FADS2    $\mathcal{P}=6.68\times$   $10^{-28}$  ), and  TMEM258    $\left(P=1.00\times10^{-56}\right)$  ).  

# Differential Expression Analysis  

For the genes which were presented in  Table 1 , we compared mRNA expression signals in an expression study. In this expression dataset, we found that  IRF6 ,  CUX2 ,  PIK3CD  and NDST1  were di e rent i ally expressed in PBMCs   $(P~<~0.05)$  ( Table 1 ). Among them, the expression levels of  IRF6  and  NDST1 were aﬀected by rs2013162   $(\bar{P}=6.30\,\times\,10^{-23})$  ) and rs2273235  $(P\,=\,3.23~\times\,\dot{10}^{-7})$  ) according to eQTL data from HaploReg, respectively. It means that these   $2\,\mathrm{\m{}^{6}A}$  -SNPs may aﬀect IS through altering the local gene.  

# Mendelian Random iz ation Analysis  

The SMR analysis identiﬁed several genes as potential causal genes underlying IS GWAS association   $(P_{\mathrm{SMR}}~<~5~\times~10^{-6})$  , and there was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity underlying the eQTL signals   $(P_{\mathrm{{HEDI}}}\;>\;0.05)$  ) ( Table S2 ). For the 15 genes listed in Table 1 , SMR tests   $(P<3.33\times10^{-3}$    were considered signiﬁcant) identiﬁed that three genes ( IRF6 ,  RBM18  and KCNJ11) were sign i cant ly associated with AIS,  IL16  was associated with LAS and  NDST1  was associated with CES ( Table 1 ). All of these ﬁve genes passed the HEIDI tests   $\left(P_{\mathrm{HEDI}}>0.05\right)$  ).  

# The SNP-Expression-IS Trios  

We noticed that  IRF6  and  NDST1  showed more convincing evidence. For example, the  IFR6  SNPs achieved suggestive evidence of association with AIS   $(P\,<\,5\,\times\,10^{-5})$  ) ( Figure S1 ). The AIS-associated   $(P=1.27\times10^{-4}$  )   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$   rs2013162 may aﬀect  IRF6  expression   $(P=6.30\times10^{-23})$  ),  IRF6  was di e rent i ally expressed between IS cases and controls   $(P\,=\,6.15~\times\,10^{-3})$  and showed a causal association with AIS   $(P_{\mathrm{{SMR}}}~=~3.64~\times$   $10^{-4}$  ,    $P_{\mathrm{HEIDI}}\,=\,0.11\$  ). The association between  NDST1  SNPs and CES did not reach the genome-wide sign i can ce level but many SNPs that were in linkage d is equilibrium showed suggestive evidence ( Figure S2 ). The CES-associated (  $\mathcal{P}=~3.99$   $\times\,\,\bar{1}0^{-4})$  )   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$   rs2273235 may aﬀect  NDST1  expression

 (  $(P=3.23\times10^{-7})$  ),  NDST1  was di e rent i ally expressed between IS cases and controls   $(P=\,2.65\,\times\,10^{-2})$  ) and showed a causal association with CES   $(P_{\mathrm{SMR}}=8.47\times10^{-3}$  ,    $P_{\mathrm{HEIDI}}=0.65)$  . So subsequently, we tested the association between rs2013162 and rs2273235 and mRNA expression levels of  IRF6  and  NDST1 , respectively. The MAF for rs2013162 and rs2273235 were 0.3736 and 0.4821 in Europeans ( Table 1 ), and 0.3721 and 0.2674 in the Han Chinese population according to our 40 sample, respectively. These two SNPs were high-frequency variants in both of the European and East Asian populations. We validated that rs2013162 and rs2273235 were sign i cant ly associated with IRF6  and  NDST1  expression levels in PBMCs from the Chinese Han individuals (linear regression    $P\;=\;0.0247$   and 0.0007) ( Figures 2 ,  3 ), respectively.  

# DISCUSSION  

This study represents the ﬁrst eﬀort to identify putative functional variants and causal genes for IS by integrating   $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}.$  SNPs data, gene expression data and genetic association data from large scale GWAS. We found out several   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   (e.g., rs2013162 and rs2273235) which may be putative functional

FIGURE 1 |  Genome-wide results for the association between  $\mathsf{m}^{6}\mathsf{A}.$  -SNPs and IS. The Manhattan plots show  $-|_{0\bar{9}10}P$   values for the  $\mathsf{m}^{6}\mathsf{A}.$  -SNPs associated with IS and subtypes. The data was from the IS GWAS published by the MEGASTROKE consortium at 2018 ( 2 ).  

variants for IS. Moreover, we also showed that these SNPs have potential to aﬀect transcription regulation and were associated with expressions of the local genes (e.g.,  IRF6  and  NDST1 ). These genes may be potential causal genes for IS.  

It seems that   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   may be causally associated with IS by inﬂuencing gene expression. Studies have shown that  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$  modi cation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of downstream molecular events such as nuclear export, stability, transl at ability, splicing, and miRNA processing ( 18 ). So one of the functional interpretations for the eﬀect of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   on IS could be their inﬂuence on gene expression levels. Then if the   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$   is causal SNP, the aﬀected gene should be causal gene. In this study we detected several potential causal genes for IS based on large data of eQTL and GWAS. For these genes, we validated the association between   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   and gene expression (e.g.,  IRF6 and  NDST1 ) in public and in-house data. This ﬁnding supported our hypothesis that   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   may be causally associated with IS by inﬂuencing gene expression.  

The  IRF6  gene encodes a member of the IRF family of transcription factors which play roles in cardiovascular diseases ( 19 ,  20 ).  IRF6  is likely to promote in amma tion to P orph y rom on as gingivalis  through its regulation of   $\mathrm{IL}_{-}36\gamma$  ( 21 ), and exhibits tumor suppressor activity in squamous cell carcinomas ( 22 ). The RIPK4-IRF6 signaling axis plays a multifaceted role in barrier epithelial homeostasis through its regulation of both keratin o cyte in amma tion and di e rent i ation ( 23 ).  IRF6  also contributes to host defense by providing speciﬁcity to the regulation of in amma tory chemokine expression by TLR2 in epithelial cells ( 24 ). The synonymous  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$   rs2013162 in  IRF6  (1q32.2) has been well studied on disease. This SNP was not reported in the original METASTROKE GWAS ( 2 ). But by looking up the published

FIGURE 3 |  Association between rs2273235 and  NDST1  expression and CES.  (A)  The minor allele C carriers of rs2273235 tend to have higher  NDST1  gene expression levels in PBMCs of Chinese individuals.  (B)  NDST1  was differential ly expressed between IS cases and controls according to the data of GSE22255. (C)  NDST1  expression seems to be causally associated with CES  $(P_{\sf S M R}=8.47\times10^{-3}$  ,    $P_{\mathsf{H E I D I}}=0.65)$  .  

GWAS data, we found that rs2013162 was also associated with intra cerebral hemorrhage   $(P\,=\,3.26~\times~10^{-4})$   ( 25 ) and large artery atherosclerosis-related stroke   $(P=9.34\times10^{-3}$  ) ( 26 ).  

NDST1  encodes a bi functional GlcNAc N-de acetyl as e/N- sul fo transfer as e with important functions in biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, which play roles in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein clearance ( 27 ), stroke ( 28 ,  29 ), and allergic airway in amma tion through the regulation of recruitment of in amma tory cells to the airways by mediating interaction of leukocytes with the vascular endothelium ( 30 ). Suppression of  NDST1  in endo the li al cells results in reduced responsiveness to  VEGFA  ( 31 ), which plays important role in cardiovascular diseases. The synonymous  $\mathrm{\bar{m^{6}A}{-S N P}}$   rs2273235 in  NDST1  (5q33.1) was associated with CES in two GWAS ( 2 ,  32 ). This SNP has the potential to alter regulatory motifs Evi-1, NF-AT1 and PTF1-beta, and locates in a CpG island (CpG: 19) and near DNase I hypersensitive sites ( Figure S3 ). All in all, the identiﬁed  $\mathrm{{m^{6}A}}.$  -SNPs and genes can be suggested as important candidates for further genetic association and functional studies.  

This study has several limitations. First, no genome-wide signiﬁcant associations between   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   and IS was found. The signiﬁcant associations proposed in this paper were at the borderline level of statistical sign i can ce after multiple testing adjustments. Second, the sample size of the di e rent i al gene expression study was small, so very few associations between gene expression levels and IS have been identiﬁed. Third, only a very small proportion of  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   were examined in this study. To fully recognize the impact of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   on IS, we still need to identify more   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   (especially the rare variants) and the eﬀects of the large amounts of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   on IS should be evaluated in larger GWAS datasets. Finally, the functionalities of the detected SNPs, especially eﬀects on   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   modi cation, have not been experimentally validated. Further experiments are needed to determine their functions.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

In summary, the present study found out several IS-associated  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s,}$  , and showed that these SNPs may aﬀect the expressions of the local genes which might be potential causal genes for IS. This study increases our understanding on the regulation patterns of SNP. Although we found supplementary functional information to support the signiﬁcant ﬁndings, further functional studies were needed to elucidate the mechanisms.
