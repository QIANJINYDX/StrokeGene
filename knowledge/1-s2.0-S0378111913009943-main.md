otide polymorphism (SNP) and ischemic stroke in a Chinese population. Methods:  We conducted a case – control study including 286 ischemic stroke patients and 336 controls. CD40 -1C/T SNP was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing methods, and evaluated its relevance to ischemic stroke susceptibility. Results:  Signi ﬁ cantly increased ischemic stroke risk was found to be associated with the T allele of CD40  -1C/T (  $.0\tt R=1.273$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}=1.016\!-\!1.594)$  ). The frequencies of CT and   $\mathrm{TT/CT}$   genotypes of  $C D4O-1C/\mathrm{T}$   in ischemic stroke patients were signi ﬁ cantly higher than those of controls, respectively (for CT:   $\mathtt{O R}=2.350$  ,  $95\%~{\tt C I}=1.601{-}3.449$  ; for  $\mathrm{TT/CT}$  :   $\mathrm{{OR}=2.148}$  ,   ${\partial5\%\ \mathsf{C I}}=1.479{-}3.119$  ). And, similar results were obtained after adjusting non-matched variables. We found that the frequency of carried T genotypes (TT and TT/CT) was signi ﬁ cantly increased in patients with history of stroke compared with patients without (for TT:  $\mathrm{OR}=6.538$  ,  $95\%\mathrm{I}=1.655{-}25.833$  ; for  $\mathrm{TT/CT}$  :  $\mathrm{OR}=3.469$  ,  $95\%\mathrm{CI}=1.031{-}11.670.$  ), respectively. Conclusions:  The  ﬁ ndings suggested that the  CD40  -1C/T polymorphism might contribute to the susceptibility to ischemic stroke in the Chinese population, and might be associated with history of previous stroke.

group of heterogeneous disorders with multiple genetic and environmental risk factors ( Dominiczak and McBride, 2003; Sacco et al., 1997 ). Many susceptibility genes associated with ischemic stroke have been identi ﬁ ed. However, these susceptibility genes explained only a small fraction of the inherited risk of ischemic stroke; and the remainders were attributable to covariates such as lipids, diabetes, blood pressure, and smoking ( Bersano et al., 2008; Dominiczak and McBride, 2003; Duggirala et al., 1996 ). Better knowledge of the genetic background and susceptibility genes would probably help us focus on early diagnosis and treatment, and improve ischemic stroke outcome in affected patients.  

Stroke, a major cause of death and long term disability, is a heavy economic and health burden for patients and societies in the world ( Ma et al., 2010; Wolf, 1998 ). It is characterized by a high mortality rate in the acute phase, high disability and handicap, high recurrence, and low complete rehabilitation rate ( Rosenberg and Popelka, 2000; Sturm et al., 2004; Wolfe et al., 2000 ). Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke(over  $80\%$   of all strokes)( Rosamond et al., 2008 ), which is a late-onset and complex polygenic disease, consisting of a  

CD40 is a cell surface trimeric trans membrane glycoprotein from a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member, which is expressed on the surface of immune cells, including B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells, as well as non-immune cells such as endo the li al cells, epithelial cells, mes enc hy mal cells, platelets and malignant tumor cells ( Chen et al., 2006 ). CD40 was located on 20q12 – 13.2, and determined T cell responses to antigen presentation and B cells immunoglobulin isotype switching ( Chen et al., 2006 ). Recently, some studies have demonstrated that CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) was elevated on monocytes or in serum of patients after transient ischemic attack or stroke, and involved in the path o physiology of ischemic stroke which was related to in ﬂ ammatory response, th rom bogen ic components and pro a the rogen ic milieu ( Garlichs et al., 2003; Grau and Lichy, 2003; Ishikawa et al., 2005 ). CD40 mRNA and protein were also expressed on neuronal cells, and played a role in neuronal development, maintenance and protection both  in vitro  and  in vivo  ( Tan et al., 2002 ). Besides, CD40 was detected on vascular endo the li al cells, smooth muscle cells, astrocytes and microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) ( Chen et al., 2006; Vowinkel et al., 2006 ). Interaction between CD40 on microglia and CD40L presented by in ﬁ ltrating T lymphocytes and other resident CNS cells triggered a series of intracellular signaling events that promoted the production of a wide array of cytokines, chemokines and neurotoxins ( Chen et al., 2006 ). These data demonstrated that CD40 might play an important role in ischemic stroke, and was likely a positional candidate gene for its risk.  

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent type of variation in the human genome ( Wang et al., 1998 ). There are about 45 SNPs for the CD40 gene in the Chinese Han population ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks ). CD40 SNPs associated with infection- and autoimmunity-associated diseases were widely studied,  e.g.  acute coronary syndrome, Graves' disease ( Burdon et al., 2006; Kurylowicz et al., 2005; Tian et al., 2010 ). However, only one known SNP affected CD40 protein levels, which was located at the   $^{-1}$  position in the  $5^{\prime}$  -untranslated region (  $5^{\prime}$  -UTR) nearby the start codon, and coincided with the Kozak consensus sequence(CD40 -1C/T; refSNP ID: rs1883832) ( Jacobson et al., 2005; Kozak, 1987; Tomer et al., 2002 ). Besides the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism which associated with acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery calci ﬁ cation was identi ﬁ ed ( Burdon et al., 2006; Tian et al., 2010 ), which might play an important role in the development of ischemic stroke. To our best knowledge, only del Rio-Espinola et al. reported that the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism might be associated with re occlusion risk after successful  ﬁ brinolytic therapy during the acute phase of ischemic stroke in Spanish ( del Rio-Espinola et al., 2010 ). However, only little information was available on the association between the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism and genetic susceptibility to ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism was a high-risk gene which might affect CD40 protein expression in ischemic stroke, and help re ﬁ ne the ischemic stroke risk pro ﬁ le. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the relationship between the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk, as well as the association between the SNP and risk factors of ischemic stroke through a case – control study derived from a general Chinese population.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. Study population  

Participants were enrolled from the Department of Neurology, Af ﬁ liated Hospital of North-Sichuan Medical College. The study was performed with the approval of the hospital ethics committee, and written informed consents were obtained from all the subjects. The pilot study population consisted of 286 patients who suffered from ischemic stroke as the case group (174 men and 112 women, mean age:  $66.08\pm\:10.87$   years) from July 2009 to July 2010, and 336 healthy volunteers as the control group (183 men and 153 women, mean age:  $67.51\,\pm\,10.39$   years) during the same period. All the cases and controls selected from the same Chinese Han population were unrelated by selfdescription.  

In our study, all the participants were adult men and women over the age of 35 years. Ischemic stroke diagnosis was made according to the International Classi ﬁ cation of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modi ﬁ - cation (ICD-9-CM) code 433, 434, and 436 ( Goldstein, 1998 ), and all cases were ascertained in accordance with World Health Organization criteria by two neurologists on the basis of history, physical examination, B-mode carotid ultra sonography, electrocardiograph y, and cranial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Covariates of age, gender, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hyper lipid emi a, previous stroke, and smoking status were carefully recorded. The ischemic stroke classi ﬁ cation was according to the Trial of Org10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria ( Adams et al., 1993 ). TOAST subtypes were as follows: large artery atherosclerosis (LAA,   $\mathsf{n}=36$  ); car dio embolism (CE,  $\mathfrak{n}=22$  ); small vessel occlusion (SVO,  $\mathfrak{n}=188$  ); other etiology (  $\mathrm{n}=40$  ) including speci ﬁ c etiology (2 cases) and undetermined etiology (38 cases). Stroke severity on admission was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Individuals diagnosed with hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attacks, sinus thrombosis, traumatic brain injuries, tumors, infective diseases, and spontaneous sub ara ch noid hemorrhages were excluded.  

In the control group, individuals without clinical or radiological evidence of cerebro vascular diseases or arterial vascular diseases were recruited. Individuals were excluded if they had a history of stroke and hereditary diseases, tumors, or infective diseases in the past 4 weeks before the study. All the controls were similar to ischemic stroke patients in age, gender, and smoker status.  

# 2.2. Genotyping  

Genomic DNA of each individual was extracted from  $200\;\upmu$   EDTA $\mathrm{Na}_{2}$   anti coagulated peripheral blood samples according to the manufacturer's instructions of a commercial DNA isolation kit from Bioteke (Peking, China), and its concentration was determined using a NanoDrop  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   ND-1000 Spectrophotometer from Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c Inc. (Waltham, USA).  

Genotyping ( CD40  -1C/T) was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Primer sequences, reaction conditions, and restriction enzymes used were described previously ( Liu et al., 2009 ). In brief, the PCR was carried out in a total volume of   $25\,\upmu$  , containing   $100~\mathrm{{ng}}$   genomic DNA,   $2.5\;\upmu$  of   $10\times$   buffer,   $0.5\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{l}$   of primers,  $0.15\;\mathrm{mmol/l}$   of dNTP,   $1.5\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$  of   $\mathrm{{MgCl}_{2}}$  , and    $1\;\mathrm{U}$   of  Taq  DNA polymerase (Tiangen Biotech, Peking, China). PCR was started with an initial de natura tion step for 5 mins at  $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , 35 cycles of de natura tion for   $30~s$   at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , annealing for 30 s at  $65~^{\circ}\mathsf{C},$   and extension for 30s at   $72\ ^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  , followed by a  ﬁ nal extension step for   $10~\mathrm{{mins}}$   at   $72~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   in a thermal-cycler (MyCycler ™ Thermal Cycler; BIO-RAD, USA). The PCR products were digested by   $2\;\mathrm{U}$  of  sty I (New England BioLabs, Ltd) at  $37~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for  $4\mathrm{~h~}$  , in which CD40 -1C/T allele C yielded four fragments including 85 bp, 11 bp, 74 bp and 133 bp, allele T yielded three fragments including 85 bp, 11 bp, and 207 bp. The digestion products were analyzed directly by a  $6\%$   non-denaturing polya cry l amide gel, stained with   $1.0\;\mathrm{g/L}$   of argent nitrate as well ( Fig. 1 ). To con ﬁ rm the accuracy of the method used, the genotypes were con ﬁ rmed by the DNA sequencing analysis, and at the same time, about   $10\%$   of the samples were randomly selected to perform the repeated assays and the results were  $100\%$   concordant.  

# 2.3. Statistical analysis  

Genotype and allele frequency of  CD40  -1C/T were compared between ischemic stroke patients and controls using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test when appropriate, and odds ratio (OR) and  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the effects of any difference between allelic and genotype distribution. Demographic and vascular risk factors between groups were compared by the chi-square test for categorical variables, and by a parametric (Student's  t -test) or non parametric test (Wilcoxon rank sum test) for differences in continuous variables. The Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was evaluated with a goodness of  ﬁ t for the chi-square test with one degree of freedom to compare the observed genotype frequencies among the subjects with the expected genotype frequency. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to  ﬁ nd the

associations between the  CD40  -1C/T polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk after adjusting non-matched variables (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and hyper lipid emi a). Association between the  CD40  -1C/T polymorphism and demographic characteristics, risk factors, TOAST classi ﬁ cation, or stroke severity was also estimated using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test under heterozygote, homozygote, dominant, and recessive genetic models. All the statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS for Windows software package version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) and a two-sided  $P$   value  $<0.05$   was taken as the level for statistical signi ﬁ cance.

Clinical characteristics of the ischemic stroke patients and control subjects were summarized in  Table 1 . As was indicated that the patients in the case group showed more conventional risk factors such as obesity (body mass index  $>24$  ), hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and hyper lipid emi a compared with the control subjects   $\left(\mathrm{P}<0.05\right)$  ). No signi ﬁ cant differences in gender, age, or smoking status were observed between the ischemic stroke patients and controls   $\mathrm{{P}}>0.05.$  ). Previous instances of stroke were found in 43 cases   $'15.03\%)$  ). The median NIHSS score of the cases on admission was 4.

# 3.2. CD40 -1C/T polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk  

The CD40 -1C/T polymorphism was successfully genotyped in the 286 ischemic stroke patients and 336 control subjects. Genotype distributions of the CD40 -1C/T SNP in the control group were in agreement with that which was expected under the HWE(  $\mathrm{\dot{P}}=0.261$  ). The genotype and allele frequencies of the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism between the controls and the cases were shown in  Table 2 . A signi ﬁ cant difference about the allele T frequency of CD40 -1C/T was found between the ischemic stroke patients and controls (  $46.85\%$   vs  $40.92\%$  ,  $\mathrm{P}=0.036,0\mathrm{R}=1.273,95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=1.016{-}1.594).$   Signi cantly increased ischemic stroke risks were suggested to be associated with CT and TT/CT genotypes of CD40 -1C/T compared with the CC genotype, respectively

 (for CT:   $\mathrm{P}<0.001$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}=2.350$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}=1.601\!-\!3.449$  ; for   $\mathrm{TT/CT}$  :

  $\mathrm{P}<0.001$  ,   $\mathrm{{OR}=2.148}$  ,   $!5\%~{\tt C I}=1.479–3.119$  ). And a signi ﬁ cantly increased ischemic stroke risk was also associated with CT and   $\mathrm{TT/CT}$  genotypes of CD40 -1C/T through a logistic regression analysis after adjusting non-matched variables, respectively (for CT:   $\mathrm{P}=0.001$  ,

  $\mathrm{{OR}=2.018}$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}=1.316{-}3.094$  ; for   $\mathrm{TT/CT}$  :   $\mathrm{P}=0.004$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}=$  1.835,   $95\%~{\tt C I}=1.211{-2.779}$  ). The current case – control study with 286 ischemia stroke cases and 336 controls had   $83\%$   statistical power to detect an OR of 2.0 or greater at a  $5\%$   signi ﬁ cance level.  

We found that the frequencies of carried  $\mathrm{T}$   genotypes (TT and TT/CT) were signi ﬁ cantly different in patients with history of stroke compared with patients without (for TT:   $25.00\%$   vs    $10.70\%$  ,   $\mathrm{P}=$  0.003,   $\mathrm{OR}=6.538$  ,  $95\%~{\mathsf{C I}}=1.655{-}25.833$  ; for TT/CT:   $93.02\%$   vs

  $80.66\%$  ,   $\mathrm{P}=0.034$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}=3.469$  ,   $95\%~{\sf C I}=1.031\!-\!11.670)$   under a homozygote comparison model and dominant genetic model, respectively. There were signi ﬁ cant associations between CD40 -1C/T SNP and LAA, SVO, as well as a CE stroke subtype under a heterozygote comparison and dominant genetic model, respectively   $(P<0.05)$  . However, we failed to  ﬁ nd CD40 -1C/T SNP to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with demographic characteristics (gender, and age), risk factors (obesity, smoking status, hypertensive disease, diabetes mellitus, CHD, and hyper lipid emi a), or NIHSS scales under heterozygote, homozygote, dominant, and recessive genetic models (  $\mathrm{P}>0.05,$  ) (Supplementary data).

Daemen, 2002 ). Over-activated CD40 led to elevated expression of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in autoimmune and chronic in ﬂ ammatory diseases ( Grewal and Flavell, 1998 ). It might be involved in the path o physiology pathway of ischemic stroke, including in ﬂ ammatory response, th rom bogen ic components and pro a the rogen ic milieu ( Grau and Lichy, 2003; Ishikawa et al., 2005 ). It was indicated that the CD40 gene might be a potential candidate for genetic susceptibility of ischemic stroke. Some studies had investigated the possible association of certain polymorphisms of CD40 with various diseases in different populations, especially, the -1C/T polymorphism in the   $5^{\prime}$  -UTR ( Kurylowicz et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2009; Park et al., 2007; Ray chau dhu ri et al., 2008; Skibola et al., 2008 ). The CD40 -1C/T polymorphism coincided with the Kozak consensus sequence (GCCACCATGG) which was compiled from 699 vertebrate genes, consisted of 6 – 8 nucleotides before and after the initiation codon (ATG), and  ﬂ anked the starting methionine (AUG) codon ( Kozak, 1987, 1991a ). Only one known SNP affected translation of a nascent mRNA and CD40 protein levels ( Jacobson et al., 2005; Kozak, 1987; Tomer et al., 2002 ).  

In the current study, we found that the frequencies of the allele T, and carried T genotypes (CT, and CT/TT) of CD40 -1C/T in patients predicted a signi ﬁ cantly higher ischemic stroke risk compared with those of healthy controls ( Table 2 ). It was indicated that the  CD40  -1C/T polymorphism might play an important role in the development of ischemic stroke. Previous studies revealed that the  CD40  -1C/T allele T or carried T genotypes played a risk role in breast cancer, nonHodgkin lymphoma ( Shuang et al., 2011; Skibola et al., 2008 ). The CD40  -1C/T polymorphism change from a C allele to T allele (nonconservative change) could cause major alterations in the initiation of translation of a gene ( Kozak, 1991b, 1999 ). Functional studies had shown that individuals who carried T genotypes or allele T of  CD40 -1C/T have lower circulating sCD40 levels and reduced levels of CD40 on the surfaces of monocyte-derived activated dendritic cells and B cells ( Jacobson et al., 2005; Skibola et al., 2008 ). It was probable that the allele T of CD40 -1C/T might reduce CD40 expression on neuronal cells, vascular endo the li al cells, astrocytes and microglia in the CNS, in ﬂ ammatory cells, as well as immune cell surfaces by hindering the stabilization of the mRNA-ribosome complex and inducing aberrant splicing, which could impede the immune system from mounting appropriate humoral and cell-mediated responses, and eliminate infectious agents ( Dolen et al., 2010; Skibola et al., 2008 ). A low CD40 expression in these cells could reduce their half life and thus affect the path o physiology pathway of ischemic stroke. Meanwhile, thrombus composition and its pattern of lyses might be in ﬂ uenced by CD40 – CD40L levels, or new generated CD40 isoforms were altered in ischemic stroke, leading to altered CD40 – CD40L binding dynamics, and higher platelet – leukocyte adhesion ( del Rio-Espinola et al., 2010 ), thus increasing the ischemic stroke risk. However, our results were not consistent with those of some studies ( Burdon et al., 2006; Tian et al., 2010 ). It might be a dissimilar genetic or etiologic contribution to different diseases, and genetic heterogeneity, ethnic as well as geographic variations which might change the frequency of speci ﬁ c polymorphisms in different diseases.  

Interestingly, we found that the T carrier genotypes (TT and TT/CT) of  CD40  -1C/T signi ﬁ cantly increased ischemic stroke risk in patients with history of stroke. It was consistent with del Rio-Espinola's study in which the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism might be associated with re occlusion risk after successful  ﬁ brinolytic therapy during the acute phase of ischemic stroke ( del Rio-Espinola et al., 2010 ). After ischemic stroke, thrombus composition and its pattern of lyses might be in ﬂ uenced by CD40 – CD40L levels, or new generated CD40 isoforms were altered from alternative translational start sites  in vivo , leading to altered CD40 – CD40L binding dynamics, higher platelet – leukocyte adhesion, higher vessel re occlusion, and higher neurological de ﬁ cits ( del Rio-Espinola et al., 2010 ). Meanwhile, there was signi ﬁ cant association between CD40 -1C/T SNP and LAA, SVO, as well as a CE subtype under a heterozygote comparison and dominant genetic model. These data indicate that CD40 -1C/T SNP might be related to the above-mentioned subtypes. More importantly, it might be a result from the small sample size, as there were only 36 patients with LAA, and 22 patients with CE. Therefore, the samples size of different stroke subtypes require an increase in the number of participants in order to con ﬁ rm the effect of the SNP. However, the  CD40  -1C/T polymorphism was not associated with other stroke-related risk factors. This observation could provide evidence that these risk factors might not contribute to the progress of ischemic stroke in the  CD40  -1C/T polymorphism. It was possible that CD40 was a genetic determinant only for ischemic stroke, but not stroke-related risk factors, or stroke severity.  

In our study, we found that genotype and allele frequencies of  CD40 -1C/T in the control group differed a lot from those of the controls in other studies of Chinese population ( Wang et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2010 ). The reason might be that the Chinese population living in different geographic regions exhibited geographic variations and genetic heterogeneity since the studies were performed in different regions of China. Second, a population selection bias might not be excluded, because clinical characteristics of the case group were different from those studies, meanwhile control group factors were different,  e.g.  age, and gender. Third, sample size and genotyping methods were also sources of different frequencies of CD40 -1C/T in the controls.  

There were some limitations in the study. First, the relatively small sample size including only 286 cases and 336 controls might lead to occurrence of statistical deviations by chance, and of weak associations missed. But, there were   $83\%$   statistical powers to detect an OR of 2.0 or greater. Larger sample sizes need to be conducted in further study. Second, a possible selection bias could not be ruled out because of a one hospital-based case – control study. It was possible that difference seen in other studies might be due to population strati ﬁ cation and different constitutions of patients. Third, the results should not be extrapolated to apply to other populations for our study was limited to a Chinese population. However, potential confounding factors might be minimized through matching of age, sex, and smoking status between cases and controls. Further studies in different population could help establishing the true signi ﬁ cance of the association between SNP and ischemic stroke risk. Fourth, the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism might be only one of the potential factors in ischemic stroke susceptibility. There might be other genes which contribute to the genetic susceptibility to ischemic stroke. Meanwhile, we could not rule out the possibility that other variants, such as linkage d is equilibrium (LD) with CD40 -1C/T, were responsible for the higher ischemic stroke rates observed. The SNP (rs1883832) in near-perfect LD with rs4810485 (  $\mathrm{\dot{r}}^{2}=0.95\mathrm{.}$  ) had been found associated with autoimmune thyroid disease ( Ray chau dhu ri et al., 2008 ). Further studies should be performed to illustrate the relation between the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism and ischemic stroke susceptibility in a larger cohort population, independent of or in combination with other CD40 and other gene SNPs. It would help clarify the role of CD40 in the development of ischemic stroke.  

In conclusion, this study provided evidence that the CD40 -1C/T polymorphism might contribute to the susceptibility to ischemic stroke, and might be associated with history of previous stroke in a Chinese population. Further study is necessary to explore the details of the physiological function and the molecular mechanisms underlying the association of this genetic locus with ischemic stroke.
