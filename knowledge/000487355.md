# Abstract  

Background/Aims:  The association between the genetic polymorphisms located in either the  exon or untranslated region of MTHFR and the risk of human atherosclerosis has been welldocumented. This study analyzed MTHFR polymorphisms at the   $3^{\prime}$  -untranslated region for  association with risk and outcome of atherosclerosis in a Chinese Han population.  Methods:  The  hospital based case-control study was conducted with 500 patients and 600 healthy volunteers  as control enrolled. The genotyping was conducted by using Taqman probe. The potential  interaction was predicted by multiple bioinformatics analysis. The relative expression of MTHFR  was detected by qRT-PCR. Further confirmation was determined by dual-luciferase assay.  The plasma homo cyst eine levels were assayed by ELISA.  Results:  Cigarette smoking, alcohol  consumption, diabetes, hypertension and low levels of serum high-density lipoprotein-C were  associated with an increased risk of developing ischemic stroke. MTHFR rs915014 AG and GG  genotypes were significantly associated with increased risk of rs915014 compared with the GG  genotype. The qRT-PCR confirmed that MTHFR rs915014 AG or GG genotypes could facilitate  miR-2861 binding leading to decreased MTHFR levels in cells. In addition, patients carrying  the MTHFR rs915014 AG or GG genotypes were associated with accumulation of circulating  tHcy volume and a poor atherosclerosis consequence.  Conclusions:  This study demonstrates  that the MTHFR rs915014 is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and might be a  shot term outcome biomarker for atherosclerosis patients.

# Introduction  

Atherosclerosis was known as a devastating and life-threatening disease that is  characterized by an accumulation of fibrous elements and lipids in large arteries and is the  leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide [1, 2]. It is believed that endo the li al  cells apoptosis results in the denudation or dysfunction of the intact endo the li al monolayer,  which causes lipid accumulation, monocyte adhesion, and inflammatory reactions leading to  at hero sclerotic lesion [3].  

Traditional analysis regarding the polymorphism in IS patients just focused on the  genotype frequency in patients and control samples. Currently, miRNA has been documented  as function factor involved in the SNP associated post-transcriptional regulation [4, 5].  The  binding of certain miRNA could be influenced in different genotypes causing the different  expression of mRNA level with [6, 7]. MiRNA are small, non-coding RNA molecules. MicroRNAs  (miRNAs) are a family of small noncoding RNAs with 20-25 nucleotides, which function  through binding to their complementary sites on the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of target mRNAs to mediate  mRNA degradation and translation repression [8, 9]. Through binding to the  $3^{\prime}$   untranslated  region (  $\cdot_{3},$  -UTR) of messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNA can cause degradation of mRNA, thus  regulating the expression of mRNA at post-transcription level [10]. Genetic variations in the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of certain genes are able to change the expression of the genes and alter the risk of a  variety of human cancers [6]. Thus, in this study, we assessed genetic variants in the MTHFR   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR in atherosclerosis patients and healthy control individuals, and then associated  these genetic variants with miRNA levels using a case-control study design in a Chinese Han  population.  

Methylene tetra hydro folate reductase (MTHFR) is the key enzyme for the metabolism  of circulating homo cyst eine (tHcy) [11]. This plays an important role in the regulation of cell  signaling and homeostasis. During stress, ROS levels can be increased dramatically, resulting  in cell structure damage [12]. For example, up regulated tHcy can induce cell apoptosis  by increased ROS levels through activation of the   $\mathtt{p38}$   MAPK pathway [13]. This plays an  important role in the regulation of cell signaling and homeostasis. MTHFR is localized at  chromosome 1 p36.3 of human genome, and to date there are over 40 point mutations or SNPs  in the MTHFR gene identified [14, 15]. The polymorphism 1801133 involves substitution of  C to T at position 677 (C677T), causing the conversion of alanine to valine. This missense  mutation will result in approximately  $70\%$   and  $35\%$   reductions of normal MTHFR enzymatic  activity in TT and CT genotype carriers [16, 17].  

# Materials and Methods  

Study subjects  

In this study, we enrolled 500 patients diagnosed with atherosclerosis from Zhengzhou Central  Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University between July 2009 and April 2016. Diagnosis of patients with  atherosclerosis was established clinically. We also recruited 600 healthy volunteers from this hospital  during the same period of time and they were matched to the cases by age and gender. All control individuals  visited our hospital for annual health check-ups and were free of atherosclerosis. This study was approved  by the Ethics Committee of Zhengzhou University and each participant signed a written informed consent.  

Bio in format ic analysis of miRNAs binding to MTHFR SNP and linkage d is equilibrium analysis among  MTHFR polymorphisms Bioinformatics software (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/miRNASNP2/) was used to detect the  candidate SNPs which could affect MTHFR gene regulation via miRNAs.  

Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping  

Blood samples were collected after a   $12\mathrm{h}$   overnight fasting period and then separated into serum,  red blood cells, and buffy coat. Genomic DNA from peripheral whole blood of every validation subject was  extracted by using QIAamp DNA blood mini kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s  instructions. After quant if i cation, these DNA samples were subjected to DNA genotyping using the TaqMan  SNP Genotyping Assay. Briefly, genomic DNA samples of   $10~\mathrm{{ng}}$   each were amplified using PCR in a total  volume of  $5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   containing TaqMan Universal Master Mix,  $80\mathrm{x\,S N P}$   Genotyping AssayMix, DNase-free water  and 10-ng DNA. The PCR conditions were   $50\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $2\,\mathrm{{min}}$   and then  $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$  , followed by 40 cycles of   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $15\,s$   and  $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $1\,\mathrm{{min}}$   in a 384-well ABI  $7900\mathrm{HT}$   Real Time PCR System as described previously.  

Cell line, culture, and miR-2861 transfection  

Embryonic Kidney 293T cells were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank  (Shanghai, China) and cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Gait her s burg, MD, USA) supplemented with   $10\,\%$   fetal  bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a humidified incubator with  $5\,\%\,\mathrm{C}0_{_2}$   at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The miR-2861  mimics and control were obtained from Genepharma (Shanghai, China) and trans fec ted into 293T cells  using Lip of ect amine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.  

Construction of luciferase-based reporter plasmids and luciferase reporter assay  

MTHFR   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR fragments containing either A or G alleles were amplified using PCR from genomic  DNA and cloned into pGL3-promoter less luciferase-based plasmids (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) multiple  cloning sites. MTHFR   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR fragments potentially binding to miR-2861, predicted by bioinformatics  analysis or a mutated sequence with the predicted target sites, were cloned using PCR from genomic DNA  and inserted into the pGL3 promoter vector (Genscript, Nanjing, China). The cloned plasmids were amplified  and verified by DNA sequencing. Next, 293T cells were plated onto 24-well plates and trans fec ted with 100  ng of pGL3- MTHFR wild, pGL3- MTHFR mutant, and miR-2861 mimics, respectively. A Renilla luciferase  vector pRL-SV40 (5ng) was also co-trans fec ted as a normalization and transfection efficiency control. Each  experiment was performed in triplicate and luciferase activity was assessed 48h after transfection using  the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla  luciferase activity.  

# ELISA of plasma homo cyst eine levels  

Plasma levels of tHcy in patients was assessed using a tHcy ELISA kit (Green Stone, Bern, Switzerland),  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The level of plasma tHcy was normalized to the kit standard and  the data were summarized as Mean  $\pm\nobreakspace{\cal S}\mathrm{D}$  .  

# Statistical analysis  

The association between different genetic variants and ischemic stroke risk was evaluated by  calculation of the odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) using univariate and multivariate  logistic regression analysis. The difference in association of MTHFR mRNA levels with three MTHFR  genotypes and of the relative luciferase activity between the wild and mutant genotype were evaluated  by using an independent-sample t test. All statistical analyses were two-sided and  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$   was considered  statistically significant using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) or SAS software (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute,  Cary, NC, USA).  

# Results  

Characteristics of par­ ticipants  

Characteristics of pa­ tients with at hero scl ero­ sis and healthy controls  are shown in Table 1. Spe­ cifically, the controls were  matched with cases for  age and gender. Cigarette  smoking (  $_{\mathrm{~P~}<0.001}$  , alcohol  consumption (P   $_{<0.001)}$  ,  diabetes and hypertension   $\scriptstyle(\mathrm{P}\ <0.001)$  , a low level of  serum high-density lipo­ protein-C (HDL-C;   $\mathrm{P}=0.02\$  )  were significantly associ­ ated with ischemic stroke.

However, BMI and total se­ rum cholesterol concentra­ tion were not associated  with ischemic stroke (Ta­ ble1).  

Identification of MTHFR  polymorphisms in   $3^{\prime}$  - UTR  

of the SNPs in the MTHFR   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR to ischemic stroke  risk and outcome. We first  searched the GenBank of Single Nucleotide  Polymorphism (SNP) database (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp) to identify  potential MTHFR genetic variants in the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR using the following parameters:  Organism (Homo sapiens); Function  Class (  $\cdot_{3},$  -UTR); Global MAF (0.05-0.1);  Validation Status (by-1000 Genomes). We  identified five MTHFR polymorphisms  (Table 2).

We  then  assessed  frequencies of these five MTHFR SNPs  in 500 atherosclerosis patients and 600  healthy controls. We found that the MTHFR  SNP rs915014 had a statistically different  

distribution  between  atherosclerosis  patients and healthy controls. The Chisquare test confirmed that the genotype  of rs915014 was in Hardy–Weinberg  equilibrium  distribution  pattern  in  the  healthy  control group   $\mathrm{~(P~=~0.32)~}$  .  The  logistic  regression  analysis  revealed  that  MTHFR rs915014 AG and  GG genotypes significantly  associated with increased  risk  of  developing  of  atherosclerosis  compared  with the AA genotype (OR:  1.44; 95   $\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.01-2.19  for AG genotype, while OR:  1.51;   $95~\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.09-1.98 for  GG genotype; Table 3). A

higher number of G-alleles    were also associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR: 1.68; 95 %CI: 1.29-2.65).  

Association of the MTHFR rs915014 SNP with a poor atherosclerosis outcome  

Next, we assessed the association of the MTHFR rs915014 SNP with atherosclerosis  outcome. The Gensini score system was applied to evaluate the outcome of atherosclerosis.  

We found that patients  carrying either the MTHFR  rs915014  AG  or  GG  genotype had an increased  Gensini score. Moreover, we  assessed levels of MTHFR  mRNA in patients carrying  the MTHFR rs915014 AA,  AG  and  GG  genotypes.  Our  data  showed  that  patients  carrying  the  MTHFR rs915014 AG or  GG genotypes had a higher  level of MTHFR compared  with  patients  with  the  AA  genotype.  We  then  assayed levels of serum  tHcy in patients and found  that patients carrying the  MTHFR rs915014 AG or GG  genotype were associated  with the accumulation of  serum tHcy (Table 4).

B: The mRNA expression of MTHFR was determined  by qRT-PCR in patients with different genotypes. C: Luciferase assay.  293T cells were co-trans fec ted with miR-2861 mimics or control renil­ la luciferase vector pRL-SV40 for  $48\,\mathrm{h}$  . Both firefly and renilla luciferase  activities were measured in the same sample using a luciferase assay  kit. Firefly luciferase signals were normalized with renilla luciferase  signals. Data were presented as mean  $\pm\nobreakspace{}\mathrm{SE}$  .  $^*\!\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$  .  

Thus far, we revealed that the MTHFR rs915014 SNP was associated with risk and poor  ischemic stroke outcome. We then performed bioinformatics analysis to determine whether  this MTHFR rs915014 SNP could have miRNA binding sites. We found that miR-2861 could  bind to this particular SNP of the minor allele (Fig. 1A). We therefore performed a luciferase  assay to confirm such binding and found that luciferase activity of G-allele-specific pGL3  construct was significantly suppressed by miR-2861. Luciferase activity of the A-allelespecific pGL3 construct was not altered by miR-2861 transfection in 293T cells (Fig. 1B, C).  

# Discussion  

In this study, we demonstrated the important value of MTHFR rs915014 polymorphism  with the higher risk of human atherosclerosis. Mechanistic ally, the MTHFR rs915014  polymorphism alters the binding of miR-2861 to negatively regulate MTHFR expression,  providing an epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation and expression. In this field, it was  the first time to reveal the functional SNP located in the 3’UTR of MTHFR acting as a risk  factor for the atherosclerosis.  

MTHFR is an important enzyme in the generation of ROS and subsequent cell damage.  Indeed, in ischemic conditions, ROS generation is enhanced and can lead to damage to  various types of cells, including brain endo the li al cells, leading to formation of thrombosis  and loss of brain function. Our current study provides direct evidence showing that this  novel MTHFR rs915014 polymorphism increases the risk of atherosclerosis compared  with healthy controls. For the polymorphism of MTHFR, researchers has also found the  susceptibility in human cancer disease. For example, One SNP, rs9651118 located in MTHFR,  was associated with disease recurrence, and the association persisted after multivariate  analyses adjusting for known risk factors [18]. Further PCR analysis revealed that MTHFR  expression is significantly up regulated in prostate tumor tissues when compared with  

adjacent normal tissues. In human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the  rs 114673809 A allele carrier also showed a 1.286-fold increased ESCC risk compared with  those carrying the rs 114673809 G allele genotype. Furthermore, a significant increase in  plasma homo cyst eine levels in ESCC cases carrying the AA genotype relative to ESCC cases  carrying the GG genotype were observed [19]. According to the traditional function of  MTHFR, polymorphisms in the gene that codes for MTHFR result in production of an enzyme  with decreased activity, an anomaly that can have an impact on a myriad of biochemical  processes. Ultimately MTHFR SNPs can cause hyper homo cy steinem i a (especially if folate  levels are low); affect nervous system, behavioral, and vascular health; contribute to birth  defects, miscarriage, and pre e clamps i a; modulate cancer risk and finally, could increase the  risk of atherosclerosis [20-22]. Homo cyst eine is a potentially toxic, sulfur-containing amino  acid that must be kept in check; without proper processing, it can build up and cause tissue  and organ damage. Elevated blood levels and accumulation of homo cyst eine are associated  with a variety of anomalies including birth defects, diabetes, renal disease, osteoporosis, and  vascular, immune, neuro degenerative, and neuro psychiatric disorders [23]. Elevated serum  homo cyst eine is considered an independent risk factor for vascular disease and related  complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thrombosis [24].  

There is accumulating evidence demonstrating that SNPs localized at miRNA binding  sites (miRSNPs) could affect the binding of miRNAs to the target genes and in turn result  in reduction or increase in translation of the target mRNA and altered susceptibility to  cancer. For example, previous studies showed that the rs2910164 polymorphism harboring  the sequence for miR-146a could influence susceptibility to gastric cancer in a Chinese  population, while rs4143815 and rs4819388 SNPs in the  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of B7-H1 and B7-H2 genes,  respectively, associated with development of gastric cancer.  

# Conclusion  

In summary, our current study demonstrated that the function SNP rs915014 in the  3’UTR of MTHFR AG and GG genotypes were associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis  compared with the GG genotype. The miR-2861 is able to bind to MTHFR with G allele and  down-regulate MTHFR expression resulting in an increased level of serum tHcy and a poor  atherosclerosis outcome. The detection of rs915014 in atherosclerosis combining with tHcy  might be a possible prognosis biomarker in the future.
