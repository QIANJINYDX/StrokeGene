A series of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives  1 e 14  was synthesized to investigate their neuro protective effects and mechanisms of action. Compounds    $\mathbf{5}{-}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}$   noticeably protected PC12 cells from the cyto toxicity of  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   or sodium nitro prussi de (SNP). Compound  11  was the most effective derivative. Compound  11 chelated Fe (II) iron, scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS), and restored the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Moreover, it enhanced the activity of the antioxidant defense system by increasing the serum level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and promoting the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Compound  11  caused certain improvements in behavior, the cerebral infarction area, and serum levels of biochemical indicators (TNF $\cdot\alpha$  , IL $1\upbeta$  , SOD and MDA) in a rat MCAO model. The lethal dose   $(\mathrm{LD}_{50})$   of compound  11  in mice receiving intra peritoneal injections was greater than  $400~\mathrm{mg/kg}$  . Meanwhile, p harm a co kinetic experiments revealed high bio availability of this compound after both oral and intravenous administration (  $\mathbf{\tilde{F}}=60.76\%$  ,   $\mathsf{C L}=0.014\,\mathrm{mg/kg/h})$   and a longer halflife (4.26 and 5.11 h after oral and intravenous administration, respectively). Based on these  ﬁ ndings, compound  11  may be a promising neuro protect ant for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

# 1. Introduction  

anions by the Fenton reaction [ 9 , 10 ], and evidence supports that iron-overload induces oxidative stress in the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke [ 11 ]. Iron chelators have important therapeutic potential and clinical applications [ 12 ]. Defer as i rox, a potential oral iron chelator, is undergoing clinic trials and has produced very promising results for neuro degenerative disorders [ 13 ], its triazole ring and two phenol structures are the active groups.  

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and adult disability worldwide, substantially altering patients ’  quality of life. Apart from tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), no effective clinical treatment strategy has been reported to date [ 1 e 3 ]. During cerebral ischemia, insuf ﬁ cient local blood  ﬂ ow causes oxygen and glucose deprivation, leading to energy metabolism disorders, mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase disorders, oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and in ﬂ ammatory reactions [ 4 e 6 ]. Neuro protective agents with anti-oxidative stress and anti-in ﬂ ammatory properties represent potential therapeutic strategies for ischemic stroke [ 7 ].  

In ﬂ ammatory reactions may trigger and amplify nerve injury, leading to an increase in the severity of stroke. Some antiin ﬂ ammatory drugs possess an appropriate free-radical scavenging capacity [ 14 ], potent antioxidant activities [ 15 ], and antiin ﬂ ammatory properties and have been developed as novel neuro protective agents [ 16 , 17 ]. Celecoxib, a cy clo oxygen as e-2 speci ﬁ c inhibitor, increase neuro protection in different cellular and animal models of neuro degenerative disorders [ 18 , 19 ], and its pyrazole ring and benzene s ulf on amide structure are the active groups.  

Iron is an essential element involved in fundamental biological processes as a component of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis [ 8 ], oxygen transport, electron transfer [ 9 ], etc. However, iron-overload is cytotoxic due to the generation of hydroxyl radicals and hydroxyl  

Nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a vital role in the amelioration of various diseases induced by in ﬂ ammation and oxidative stress [ 20 ]. Upon exposure to stimuli and in- ducers, Nrf2 is trans located from the cytoplasm to the nucleus resulting in enhanced cyto protection, particularly the antioxidant defense system [ 20 , 21 ], by increasing the levels of superoxide  

![](images/520b969fdccb0590da7e8bb6108ee37c2450ba64f37e375fc5e4a3980fc81289.jpg)  

dismutase (SOD), glut at hi one peroxidase (GSH-px) and reduced glut at hi one (GSH) [ 22 ]. Activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway may contribute to antioxidant and anti-in ﬂ ammatory effects and reduce ischemic stroke.  

In our search, we aimed to synthesize a series of compounds with antioxidant and anti-in ﬂ ammatory properties to identify potential neuro protective agents for the treatment of ischemic brain injury. Defer as i rox, an iron-chelating agent reduces the level of hydroxyl radicals by inhibiting the Fenton reaction induced by iron overload [ 9 , 10 ]. Considering the crucial iron-chelating role of the phenolic hydroxyl and 1,2,4-triazole groups in defer as i rox [ 23 ], we maintained that active scaffold to retain the antioxidant effect. In addition, extensive SAR studies of celecoxib indicated that the phenyl s ulf on amide moiety was a major determinant of the antiin ﬂ ammatory effects and in vivo ef ﬁ cacy [ 24 ]. Thus, based on the information described above, target compounds containing both active sites (antioxidant and anti-in ﬂ ammatory units) were prepared to obtain more powerful neuro protect ants ( Fig. 1 ). The most potent analog was further evaluated to determine its mechanism, and neuro protective effects on a rat cerebral ischemia model.

After that, stirring was undertaken at   $130{-}140\,^{\circ}\mathsf{C}.$  . The mixture was stirred for  $_{2\,\mathrm{h}}$   (TLC show acid was consumed) and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure to obtain intermediate. The intermediate, 4- hydra zi no benzene-1-s ulf on amide hydrochloride   $(1.1\,\mathrm{\g,\5\nm{ol}})$  and tri ethyl amine   $\mathrm{{'}1.0\,g,10\,m m o l)}$  ), were added to  $15\,\mathrm{mL}$   of absolute ethanol, and the mixture was stirred at   $80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $18\textrm{h}$  . When the reaction was complete, the solution was  ﬁ ltered, and saturated sodium bicarbonate was added to adjust pH to 7. The solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was washed with   $20~\mathrm{mL}$   of saturated brine and dried over anhydrous sodium. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain the target compounds. The target compounds were re crystallized from methanol.

Determination of stoic hio me tries of the complexes.  Stoichiometries of the complexes were determined using mole ration method [ 26 , 27 ].   $10~\mathrm{mL}$   volumetric  ﬂ asks were prepared and numbered in advance.  $1~\mathrm{mL}$   of  $5\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{mol/L}\,\mathrm{FeS}0_{4}\cdot\bar{7}\mathrm{H}_{2}\bar{0}$   solution was added to each numbered volumetric  ﬂ ask, and followed by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  $6~\mathrm{mL}$   of  $5\,\times\,10^{-4}\;\mathrm{mol/L}$   compound  11 , and then each volumetric ﬂ ask was diluted to   $10~\mathrm{mL}$  , respectively. The absorbance of each complex was measured at an appropriate wavelength, at which the complex solution showed intense absorption but compound  11  did not. The absorbance (OD value) was taken as the Y axis, and the molar ratio of compound  11  to Fe (II) was plotted on the X axis.  

# 2.10. Western blot analysis  

PC12 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with different concentrations of compound  11  (1.25, 2.5, or   $5~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  ) for  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . Cells were lysed in using cell lysis buffer (containing   $1~\mathrm{mM}$  phenyl methyl s ulf on yl  ﬂ uoride (PMSF)) to obtain the total proteins. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using a Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol (Biotechnology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). For the Western blot analysis, protein extracts were quanti ﬁ ed using a BCA assay kit, and equal amounts (  $.40~\mathrm{mg}.$  /lane) of proteins were separated by   $10\%$   sodium dodecyl sulfate polya cry l amide gel electro- phoresis (  $10\%$   SDS-PAGE), and then transferred onto polyvinyl ide ne di ﬂ uoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, PA, USA). The membranes were blocked with   $5\%$   skim milk for   $^{\mathrm{~2~h~}}$   at room temperature, washed, and then incubated overnight at  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   with a Nrf2 primary antibody (dilution, 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Next, membranes were washed three times and incubated with the secondary antibody (1:5000; Yeasen, Shanghai, China) for  $_{2\,\mathrm{h}}$  . After washing the membranes, the protein bands were detected with a chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit using an ImageQuant chemiluminescence system and Image J. software was used to quantify the bands intensities. In the inhibitor experiment, the cells were pretreated with LY294002 (  $10\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for  $^{1\textrm{h}}$   before the addition of the target compounds.  

# 2.11. Inhibitor treatment  

PC12 cells were pretreated with or without compound  11  for   $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$  , and co-treated with or without   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   LY294002 (PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor) for  $24\,\mathrm{h}$  . Cells were then lysed and protein levels were determined prior to the Western blot analysis.  

Cells were pre-treated with compound  11  for   $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$  , co-treated with or without LY294002   ${'}10~\ \upmu\mathrm{M})$  , and then incubated with  $500\,\upmu\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   or  $300\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for  $5\,\mathrm{h}$   or  $24\,\mathrm{h}$  , respectively, to analyze the roles of signaling pathways in the neuro protective effects of compound  11  on PC12 cells. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay.  

# 2.12. Detecting the levels of GSH, GSH-px, and SOD  

PC12 cells were seeded in 6-well plates, cultured for  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  , pretreated with compound  11  (2.5, 5 or   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for   $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$  , and then incubated with  $500\,\upmu\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   or  $300\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for another   $5\,\mathrm{h}$   or   $24\,\mathrm{h}$  , respectively. Cells were lysed on ice in cell lysis buffer (containing  $1\:\mathrm{{mM}}$   PMSF) to prepare total protein extracts. The proteins present in cell lysates were centrifuged at   $12000\;\mathrm{g}$   for   $10\;\mathrm{{min}}$   at  $4\,^{\circ}\mathsf{C}.$   The super nat ant was collected, quanti ﬁ ed BCA kit, and then subjected to the measurement of SOD, GSH-px and GSH levels using SOD, GSH-px, and GSH detection kits, respectively, according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions.  

# 2.13. Establishment of a rat model of ischemic stroke  

Animals.  In this study, 72 male speci ﬁ c-pathogen-free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (body weight,   $\scriptstyle180-220\,\mathrm{g}.$   were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China; License No. SYXK (Guangdong) 2018-0002)  

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion  [ 28 ]. The rats were anesthetized by administering an intra peritoneal injection of  $7\%$   chloral hydrate  $(5\,\mathrm{\:mL}/\mathrm{kg})$  . The left common carotid artery and external carotid artery were separated and ligated through a median cervical incision, and the pte ry go frontal artery was separated as well. An arterial clamp was placed in the proximal and distal carotid arteries, and no. 4-0 nylon thread was inserted through the incision, to a depth of   ${17{-}20}\,\mathrm{mm}$  . The wound was disinfected with iodophor and the skin was sutured. In the sham-operated group, the other steps were the same except that no thread was inserted. The animals were randomly divided into six groups: sham-operated group, model-based control group, positive control group (edaravone injection,   $10\;\mathrm{mg/kg})$  , low- $(3{\mathrm{~mag}}/{\mathrm{kg}})$  , medium- $(10\:\mathrm{mg/kg})$   and highdose   $(30\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$   groups (  $\mathbf{\dot{n}}=12\mathbf{\dot{\$   rats in each group). The treatments were administered via intra peritoneal injection at the onset of reperfusion period by an investigator blinded to the groups. All procedures were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care Committee, and were conducted in compliance with the Chinese legislation.  

Behavioral testing  [ 29 ]. Behavioral tests were performed   $^{24\mathrm{~h~}}$  after the operation according to the 4-point scoring system proposed by Zea Longa. The speci ﬁ c criteria were 0 points, no nerve injury symptoms; 1 point, unable to completely extend the opposite front paw; 2 points, turning to the outside; 3 points, tilting to the opposite side; and 4 points, unable to walk spontaneously and loss of consciousness.  

Cerebral Infarction Area  s . After completing the behavioral tests, the animals were euthanized and brain sections were prepared for TTC staining to observe the cerebral infarction area. The whole brain was quickly removed from the skull, the olfactory bulb, cerebellum and lower brainstem were removed, and the tissue was frozen for  $25\,\mathrm{min}$  . Then, tissues were coronally cut into 5 e 7 pieces, quickly placed in   $1\%$   TTC for   $20~\mathrm{min}$  , and incubated at   $37~^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   for  $20\,\textrm{min}$  . Tissues were  ﬂ ipped every   $7{-}8\ \mathrm{min}$   and  ﬁ xed with   $4\%$  para formaldehyde after staining. The normal tissues were stained red and the injured infarcted tissues were stained white. After capturing pictures, the percentage of the cerebral infarction area was calculated using an image analysis method.  

Determination of Biochemical Indicators.  After completing the behavioral testing, the animals were euthanized, blood was collected from the abdominal vein, and the serum was stored at    $-20\,^{\circ}\mathsf{C}.$  . The serum levels of in ﬂ ammatory markers, such as IL $^{1\upbeta}$  , TNF $\mathcal{\alpha}$  , SOD, and MDA, were detected using enzyme-linked immuno s or bent assay (ELISA) kits.  

# 2.14. Acute toxicity test  

Animals.  Twenty SPF KM mice (half male and half female,  $_{18-22\,\mathrm{g})}$   were provided by Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yatsen University, License No. SYXK (Guangdong) 2018-0002.  

Acute toxicity  [ 30 ]. Twenty KM mice   $(18{-}22\,\mathrm{g})$   were divided into two groups: a compound  11  treated group   $(400\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$   and solvent control group   $(0.4\,\mathrm{\mL}/10\,\mathrm{\g})$  . The animals in each group were administered intra peritoneal injections. The reactions were observed immediately after administration for   $^{12\,\mathrm{~h~}}$  , and then observed once on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th days. The general state and body weights were recorded for 7 days. The observations included changes in the animals ’  weights, diets, appearance, behaviors, secretion, and excretion. The contents of observations of toxic symptoms were based on  Appendix II  of Technical Guiding Principles for the Study of Acute Toxicity of Chemical Drugs. The mortality rate, poisoning symptoms and the onset time, severity, and duration of poisoning reactions were recorded as well. The animals were weighed at each time point. According to the mortality rate recorded within 7 days, lethal dose, the   $50\%$   lethal dose  $(\mathrm{LD}_{50})$  ) was calculated using the weighted regression method. The treatments were administered by intra peritoneal injection at the onset of the reperfusion period by an investigator who was blinded to the groups.  

# 2.15. P harm a co kinetic studies in SD rats  

Compound  11  was dissolved in solvent and administered to 12 female SD rats (weight ranging from  $220\,\mathrm{g}$   to  $250\,\mathrm{g}.$  ) for i. v. and p. o. administration. The dosing volume was  $2~\mathrm{mg/kg}$   (i.v.) or   $20\;\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{kg}$  (p.o.). After administration, blood samples were collected at various time points   $1/12,1/6,3/10,0.5,0.75,1,2,3,4,6,8,12\,.$  and   $24\,\mathrm{h}$   (i.v.) or 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   (p.o.) for analyses. The collected blood samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for  $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$   at  $4\ {}^{\circ}\mathsf{C},$  , and then analyzed after protein precipitation. An LC/MS/MS analysis of compound  11  was performed under optimized conditions to obtain the best sensitivity and selectivity of the analyte in selected reaction monitoring mode (SRM) in samples containing an internal standard [ 31 ]. Plasma concentration-time data were measured with a non compartment al approach using the Excel program on a computer to calculate p harm a co kinetic parameters.  

# 2.16. Statistical analysis  

Biomedical experimental data were processed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software, and all measurements were performed in triplicate. All results are reported as means  $\pm$   standard deviations (SD). The statistical signi ﬁ cance of differences between the two groups were assessed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software, and  $\mathrm{~P~}<\,0.05$   was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant. Animal experimental data were statistically processed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software, and measured data are reported as means  $\pm$   standard errors of the means (SEM) and analyzed using single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) combined with Dunnett ’ s test, and count data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test.

  ${\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{H}}_{3}$  . The substituents were derived from substituted    $^{o}$  -hydroxyl benzamide and benzoic acid. These compounds were synthesized to compare whether the activity of dihydroxy compounds was better than mono hydroxyl compounds, and to compare the potency of di substituted and mono substituted compounds at the meta-position, as relevant researches support meta-substituted analogs are with good activity. (The results of the NMR analysis of compounds  1 e 14  are presented in the supporting information, purity  ${\tt>}98\%$  )  

# 3.2. Evaluating the ability of the compounds to protect cells from  $H_{2}O_{2}$   or SNP-induced death  

In ischemic stroke, oxidative stress produces excessive ROS levels, resulting in cyto toxicity and eventually more severe nerve injury. PC12 cells, which are derived from a phe och romo cyto ma of the rat adrenal medulla, are generally used as a screening model to study nerve injuries.   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   produces hydroxyl radical and is commonly used to generate oxidative stress-based models. SNP is a medication used to lower blood pressure, that is also widely utilized to induce cerebral ischemia-based models in nerve cells [ 32 ]. Treatment of PC12 cells with  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   (  $500\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for   $5\,\mathrm{h}$   or SNP   $(300\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$  for  $24\,\mathrm{h}$   causes approximately   $60\%$   of cells to die ( Fig. 2 A and C). An increase in cell viability attributed to the potent protective effects of  $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   treatments with the target compounds on   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}.$  - or SNPinduced death was  ﬁ rst assessed using the MTT assay, as shown in Fig. 2 B and D.  

Compounds  5 e 11  containing dihydroxy and mono substituted groups, actively protected PC12 cells from   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2^{\cdot}}$   or SNP- induced cell death, and showed higher activities than curcumin and edaravone. Nevertheless, compounds  $\pmb{1}\!\!-\!\!\pmb{4}$   containing the mono hydroxy group showed a poor potency, indicating a signi ﬁ cant role of the hydroxyl group. Additionally, compounds  12 e 14  containing dihydroxyl and di substituted groups did not show stronger potency, indicating that the di substituted compounds exhibited a weaker protective effect.  

# 3.3. Protective effects of compounds 5 e 11 on prominent activities  

As shown in  Fig. 3 , compounds  5 e 11  were more active than the remaining compounds. The protective ef ﬁ cacy of different concent rations of compounds  5 e 11  was assessed using MTT and LDH assays to further investigate and compare their potency. LDH is often used as an indicator of cyto toxicity. Pre treatment with compounds  5 e 11  dose-dependent ly (2.5, 5, and   $10~{\upmu\mathrm{M}}$  ) increased cell viability ( Fig. 3 A and C), and signi ﬁ cantly reduced LDH levels ( Fig. 3 B and D) in  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}.$  - or SNP treated PC12 cells. The results of the MTT assay were consistent with the results of the LDH assay. Based on our  ﬁ ndings, compound  11  was the most active compound, and the hydroxyl and 4-methoxy groups of the benzene ring were considered effective pharmaceutical ly active groups contributing to the neuro protective effects.

characteristic of apoptosis. Consistent with previous reports,   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$  or SNP caused cyto toxicity to PC12 cells mainly by inducing apoptosis. Quantitatively, the number of living cells in the   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$  group was substantially decreased, and the pre treatment with compound  11  (2.5, 5 and   $10\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$  ) effectively increased the number of living cells. In terms of morphology, the cells in the injured group exhibited nuclear condensation (brightening), and the cells were not adherent, became rounded, and displayed an unclear shape. However, the morphology of cells in the compound  11  group often appeared normal ( Fig. 4 A). Notably, SNP produced the same result as  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   ( Fig. 4 B). Thus, compound  11  effectively prevented   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   or SNP- induced apoptosis by reducing the number of condensed nuclei.  

# 3.5. Compound 11 dose-dependent ly inhibits ROS accumulation  

ROS levels were detected with 2,7-dichlorodi-hydro ﬂ uorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). DCFH-DA freely crosses the cell membrane and is hydrolyzed by an esterase to generate 2,7-dichlorodihydro ﬂ uorescein (DCFH). DCFH is oxidized by intracellular ROS to the green  ﬂ uorescent compound dichloro ﬂ uorescein (DCF). The green  ﬂ uorescence intensity is proportional to the ROS level. As shown in  Fig. 5 , compared with the control group, the green  ﬂ uorescence of the   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   ( Fig. 5 A) or SNP group ( Fig. 5 B) was signi ﬁ - cantly increased, while three different concentrations (2.5, 5, and  $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   compound  11  remarkably reduced the ROS levels in cells in the   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   or SNP group. Oxidative stress potentially disrupts the homeostasis between pro-oxidant and antioxidant systems by abnormally increasing ROS levels, indicating that compound  11 effectively antagonizes   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}.$  - or SNP- induced increases in ROS levels, and may protect cells by reducing ROS levels.

PC12 cells were pretreated with compounds  5 e 11  and edaravone for 1 h followed by treatment with  $300~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP (C) or  $400~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP (D) for another  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   (Data are expressed as the mean  $\pm\nobreakspace S\mathrm{D}$   of three independent assays).

and oxidation reactions [ 34 ], mitochondria are the main intracellular source of ROS production and are also particularly susceptible to oxidative damage [ 35 ]. The MMP is the most direct and simplest measurement that re ﬂ ects the function of mitochondria.   $5{,}5^{\prime}{,}6{,}6^{\prime}{.}$  - Tetra chl oro $^{1,1^{\prime},3,3^{\prime}}$  -tetraethyl-i mid a carbo cyan in e (JC-1) is a dye that is commonly used to rapidly and sensitively detect changes in the MMP of cells. In normal mitochondria, JC-1 aggregates to form a polymer, emitting intense red  ﬂ uorescence, while in unhealthy mitochondria, JC-1 exists as a monomer to produce green  ﬂ uorescence due to a decrease or loss of the MMP. Since green  ﬂ uorescence indicates unhealthy mitochondria, a shift in  ﬂ uorescence from red to green indicates a reduction in the MMP. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , red  ﬂ uorescence was more intense in the normal group compared with green  ﬂ uorescence, suggesting that the mitochondria were in a healthy state. After treatment with   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   ( Fig. 6 A) and SNP ( Fig. 6 B), cells with brighter green  ﬂ uorescence were observed, re ﬂ ecting a decrease in the MMP. The conversion of the  ﬂ uorescence from green to red in the compound  11  (2.5, 5, and   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  ) group indicates that the MMP was restored.  

# 3.7. Ability of compounds 1 e 14 to bind iron ions and stoic hio me tries of the compound 11-Fe (II)complex  

Iron is the core component of the mitochondrial enzyme complexes  I-IV  in the electron transport chain [ 10 ]. Notably, mitochondria are the major site of iron utilization forming iron sulfur

clusters, that are essential for the normal function of brain and biological processes. Excess iron ions cause mitochondrial dysfunction, which is closely associated with neuro degenerative diseases [ 36 ]. In the present study, the ability of the target compounds to chelate Fe (II) ions was assessed to explore the neuroprotective mechanisms of the compounds. We compared the relative binding of Fe (II) by the compounds with ferrozine, as shown in  Fig. 7 . Ferrozine is often used as a positive control due to its capability to interact with Fe (II) to form a purple complex that produces an absorption signal at   $562~\mathrm{nm}$   [ 37 ]. The absorbance of the purple-colored Fe (II)-ferrozine complex was measured in the presence or absence of targeted compounds. Compounds  5 e 14 inhibited the binding of ferrozine   $(30~\upmu\mathrm{M})$   to iron, suggesting that these compounds were more effective than ferrozine ( Fig. 7 ). However, compounds  1 e 4  were not more active than ferrozine, suggesting the importance of dihydroxy groups in iron chelation.  $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$   values for compounds  5 e 11  (neuro protection in vitro) ranged from 22 to   $45~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   ( Table 1 ). The above-mentioned outcomes supported the ability of dihydroxy compounds to bind iron ions.  

The mole ration method was used to evaluate the stoic hio metric ratio of complex. The absorption spectra of compound  11  and compound  11 e Fe (II) complex were represented in  Fig. 8 A and B. It can be seen from the spectrum that the maximum absorbance of compound  11  and compound  11 e Fe (II) complex were both determined at  $305~\mathrm{nm}$  . But at  $380~\mathrm{nm}$  , compound  11 -Fe (II) complex showed intense absorption while compound  11  did not. Therefore,  $380\,\mathrm{nm}$   was selected to evaluate the stoic hio metric ratio of the complex, thereby avoiding the interference of compound  11

When the mole ratio of compound  11  to Fe (II) was equal to or more than 2:1, the curve became stable. Thence, it can be concluded that the stoic hio metric ratio of compound  11 e Fe (II) complex was 2: 1.  

# 3.8. Compound 11 alleviates cerebral ischemic injury  

A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was exposed to compound  11 , and then the cerebral infarction volume was evaluated to con ﬁ rm the protective effect of compound  11  on ischemic disease. We performed 2,3,5-tri phenyl tetra zo liu m chloride (TTC) staining, one of the most commonly used methods for reliable macroscopic identi ﬁ cation of an infarcted tissue [ 38 ]. After  $^{24\mathrm{~h~}}$  , brain sections were prepared and TTC staining was performed. Compared with the cerebral infarction area of the shamoperated group and the model-based control group (sham-operated:  $0.00\pm0.00\%$  , model-based control group:   $28.67\pm2.90\%)$  , the cerebral infarction areas in the positive control, low-dose, middledose, and high-dose groups were signi ﬁ cantly decreased (positive control:   $15.76~\pm~3.21\%$  , low-dose:   $20.52\:\pm\:2.05\%$  , middle-dose:  $12.59\,\pm\,1.83\%$  , and high-dose:   $18.06\pm2.24\%)$  ( Fig. 9 A and B). The effect of the middle-dose on alleviating the cerebral infarction area was greater than the positive control.

After  $24\,\mathrm{h}$  , the animals ’  behaviors were scored using the 4-point scoring system described by Zea Long [ 33 ]. Compared with the behavioral scores of the sham-operated group and the modelbased control group (sham-operated:   $0.00~\pm~0.00$  , model-based control group:   $2.54\,\pm\,0.27)$  ), the scores of the positive control, low-dose, middle-dose, and high-dose groups were noticeably lower (positive control:   $1.64~\pm~0.28$  , low-dose:   $2.00~\pm~0.33$  , medium-dose:  $1.54\pm0.28$  , and high-dose:   $1.73\pm0.30)$  , as shown in Fig. 10 .

The results were consistent with previous ﬁ ndings, con ﬁ rming that compound 11 attenuated cerebral ischemic injury. As a result, the effect of medium-dose was better than that of high-dose, which may be due to the relatively narrow therapeutic window of compound  11  or low animal sensitivity. Further repeated and in-depth mechanism of action will be studied in the future work.

We examined levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malo ndi aldehyde (MDA), and in ﬂ ammatory cytokines (interleukin $1\upbeta$   (IL-1 b ) and tumor necrosis factor $\cdot\alpha$   (TNF $\cdot\alpha)$  ) in experimental animal models to elucidate the mechanism underlying the physiological improvement induced by compound  11  after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, and the results are shown in  Fig. 11 . The group treated with a medium dose of compound  11  displayed signi ﬁ cantly increased levels of SOD and MDA, but decreased levels of IL $1\upbeta$   and TNF $\mathcal{\alpha}$  , and its effect was superior to edaravone.

# 3.12. Compound 11 induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation  

Any disruption of redox homeostasis may lead to excess ROS production, causing oxidative damage. Nrf2 is a stress-responsive transcription factor that is important for protecting cells from oxidative damage and particularly neuro degenerative diseases [ 21 ]. The translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is the key factor to induce the expression of antioxidants [ 39 ], including GSH, SOD, and others, which are up-regulated to remove excess free radicals and protect nerve cells from oxidative stress [ 22 ].  

We further explored whether compound  11  induced Nrf2 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. After treating cells with compound  11  for   $^{24\mathrm{~h~}}$  , we obtained total protein, nuclear protein, and cytoplasmic protein extracts. A change in the level of total Nrf2 protein was not observed, and the level of the nuclear Nrf2 protein increased, while the cytosolic Nrf2 level decreased after   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   of treatment with compound  11  ( Fig. 12 A). The quantitative analysis revealed ( Fig. 12 B e D) that compound  11  promotes the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus, potentially allowing cells to resist oxidative damage by regulating the translocation of the Nrf2 protein.  

Antioxidant defense systems are essential for scavenging free radicals and protecting proteins and DNA from per oxidation [ 40 , 41 ]. GSH is the main non-enzymatic antioxidant in cells, and GSH-px and SOD are antioxidant enzymes [ 42 ]. Additionally, GSH, GSH-px, and SOD together increase the ability of cells to remove ROS through endogenous antioxidant reactions [ 43 ]. In the present study, we measured the intracellular contents of these three antioxidants. As shown in  Table 3 , treatment with  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   or SNP reduced the levels of GSH-px, SOD, and GSH in PC12 cells. However, compound  11  increased their levels to some extent. The antioxidant activity of compound  11  was dose-dependent, particularly at  $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  , and the levels of antioxidants in the cells were distinctly improved by compound  11.  Based on these results, compound  11 increased the cellular antioxidant activity by modulating the levels of endogenous antioxidants.  

Here, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used to decrease the expression of Nrf2 and determine whether Nrf2 is involved in the neuro protective effect of compound  11 . As displayed in  Fig. 13 A and B, LY294002 reduced the total level of Nrf2. Western blot analyses revealed a reversal of the Nrf2 by LY294002- induced decrease in Nrf2 levels in cells treated with compound  11 . Based on the results

of the MTT assay, a treatment with   $10~{\upmu\mathrm{M}}$   compound  11  produced approximately   $30\%$   higher neuro protective activity than the  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$  group ( Fig.13 C) the SNP group ( Fig.13 D), consistent with the results shown in  Fig. 2 . However, the addition of LY294002 reduced the neuro protective capacity of compound  11  to prevent  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$  - or SNPinduced cell death compared with co-treatment with compound  11 and   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   or SNP. Thus, the Nrf2 pathway is at least partially involved in the neuro protective effects of compound  11  on PC12 cells.  

# 3.13. P harm a co kinetics studies  

In vivo PK properties of compound  11  were determined in rats. As shown in  Table 4 , the in vivo half-life  $(\mathsf{t}_{1/2})$   of compound  11  for after oral administration and intravenous administration was 4.26 and 5.11 h, respectively, and the peak time   $\left({{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{max}}}\right)$   of plasma concentration after oral administration was   $2.00\,\mathrm{h}$  . The area under the curve   $(\mathsf{A U C}_{0-\infty})$   at the time of administration was 14160.53 and  $2331.53\ \mathrm{\underline{{n}}g/m L^{*}h}$  , respectively. The drug retention time were 6.32 and   $2.37\textrm{h}$  , respectively, and the relative bio availability ( F ) of the drug was   $60.76\%$  . Based on these characteristics, compound  11 possesses great advantages of drug-likeness characteristics.  

# 4. Discussion  

Excess oxidative stress and/or in ﬂ ammation are postulated to play critical roles in the pathogen es is of cerebral ischemia. Oxida- tive stress stimulates the expression of pro-in ﬂ ammatory genes, and in ﬂ ammatory factors also trigger the excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing a vicious cycle [ 20 ]. Deferasirox, an effective iron chelator, is considered resistant to oxidative stress [ 44 ]. Celecoxib is a commonly used anti-in ﬂ ammatory agent in the clinic. In this study, we used defer as i rox and celecoxib to design and synthesize new compounds with triazole and two phenol moieties to explore the antioxidant and anti-in ﬂ ammatory effects in vitro and in vivo.  

Oxidative stress is a negative consequence of the imbalance between excess free radicals and the antioxidant system [ 45 ]. Free radicals are divided into oxygen radicals and nitrogen radicals. Hydrogen peroxide is a substance that induces the production of hydroxyl radicals, which are oxygen radicals. Sodium nitro prussi de induces the formation of nitric oxide radicals, which are nitrogen radicals [ 46 ]. At the same time, iron ions have been reported to generate hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction in the body [ 9 , 10 ]. The presence of a large number of free radicals potentially causes a rapid increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species and produces neuro toxicity. According to the results of the MTT assays, compounds  5 e 11  allowed cells to resist necrosis caused by oxidative stress (both hydroxyl radicals and nitric oxide radicals), and compound  11  was the most active derivative. Simultaneously, the

ﬁ nding supported the good antioxidant effect of iron chelators. Furthermore, compound  11  signi ﬁ cantly inhibited the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  

In recent years, mitochondria have been considered a target for neuro degeneration [ 33 ]. Mitochondria are factories that provide energy. In addition, mitochondria are the center of electron production and transfer, rendering them very vulnerable to oxidative damage [ 35 ]. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) is the most direct method for assessing mitochondrial function. Compound  11  effectively restored the decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential caused by oxidative stress. Thus, compound  11 may maintain stable mitochondrial function when cells are exposed to an adverse environment.  

Furthermore, in vivo experiments were performed to verify the ﬁ ndings from the cell-based experiments described above. Cerebral ischemia is more common in the pathological process of various neurological diseases and is also known as  “ small stroke ”  [ 47 ]. The rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is a model that simulates human cerebral ischemia. In the MCAO model, neurological function was impaired resulting in behavioral abnormalities, and the cerebral infarction volume increased with cytokine abnormalities. Based on our data, compound  11  ameliorated the changes in rat behavior and reduced the cerebral infarct size. In addition, it reduced the levels of in ﬂ ammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor $\cdot\alpha$   (TNF $\cdot\alpha$  ) and interleukin $\cdot1\upbeta$   (IL-1 b ). Additionally, it increased the antioxidant capacity by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and reducing malo ndi aldehyde (MDA) levels. Moreover, the  $50\%$   lethal dose   $(\mathrm{LD}_{50})$   calculated in Kunming (KM) mice injected intra peritoneal ly with compound  11 was greater than  $400~\mathrm{mg/kg}$  . Oral administration of compound  11 resulted in a longer half-life, slower elimination, and higher bio availability (relative to the intravenous injection, the bioavailability is approximately   $60.76\%$  ). Collectively, these data con ﬁ rmed the anti-ischemic effect of compound  11  and supported its potential use as a promising neuro protective agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke.  

Additionally, the Nrf2 signaling pathway is essential for neuroprotection, particularly protection against oxidative stress [ 21 ]. Generally, the nuclear transfer of Nrf2 is the key step to activate the antioxidant defense system [ 39 ]. The intracellular antioxidant system includes antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD and GSH-px) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (GSH) [ 22 ]. Strengthening the endogenous antioxidant defense system will allow the cell resist exogenous oxidative damage. Here, compound 11 obviously increased the levels of SOD, GSH-px and GSH in PC12 cells. LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT pathway, reduced Nrf2 levels in cells. Western blots-showed that compound  11  promoted the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, reversed the changes in the Nrf2 content, and increased cell viability which was reduced by LY294002. Based on the data, Nrf2 pathway is at least partially involved in the neuro protective effects of compound  11 on PC12 cells.  

In conclusion, in this study, we designed and synthesized a series of triazole compounds containing substitutions with different groups. These compounds ( 5-11 ) were effective neuro protect ants that attenuated   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   or SNP- induced neuro toxicity. The compounds were effective Fe (II)-chelating agents, and signi ﬁ cantly reduced ROS production and maintained the change in the MMP in PC12 cells. Compound  11  outperformed curcumin or edaravone. Compound  11  improved the behavioral score of rats after acute ischemic stroke, reduced the infarct size in rats, and ameliorated the changes in the serum levels biochemical indicators (TNF $\cdot\alpha$  , IL $1\upbeta$  , SOD, and MDA) in a rat model of MCAO. This compound was also less toxic in vivo. Moreover, compound  11  promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 to activate the downstream signaling pathway and increased the activity of the antioxidant system. Compound  11  exerts its neuro protective effect by regulating antioxidants to reduce oxidative stress and in ﬂ ammation; thus, it represents as a potential neuro protective agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke in the future.
