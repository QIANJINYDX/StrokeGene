The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1 ) gene is associated with increased levels of plasma factor VIII (FVIII). We aimed to explore eight functional genetic  LRP1  variants for their potential roles in regulating FVIII levels and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This genetic association study enrolled 192 patients with AIS and 134 controls. There were no signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erences in the genetic frequency of the eight functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the control and AIS groups. However, while analyzing the association between the eight SNPs and plasma FVIII levels, subjects with T/T genotype of rs1800137 (vs.

  $\mathsf{C C}+\mathsf{C T})$   were found to be associated with higher FVIII levels   $(23.5\,\mathrm{IU/dL}$  ;   $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval,

 7.4 – 39.5 IU/dL;  $P=0.0044$  ) after adjusting for age, gender, estimated glomerular  ﬁ ltration rate, O blood type, in ﬂ ammatory state, and body mass index.  

An analysis of the mRNA stability and abundance was designed and performed using minigene system trans fec ted into HepG2 cells to assess the possible di ﬀ erences in mRNA st abilities between rs1800137 CC (rs1800137C) and TT (rs1800137T) genotypes. Site-directed mutagen es is revealed that rs1800137T accounts for the observed decrease in mRNA stability. The SNP rs1800137, located in exon 8, has been identi ﬁ ed as an exonsplicing enhancer in silico. However, alternative splicing of  LRP1  without inclusion of exon 8 was not identi ﬁ ed. In trans fec ted HepG2 cells, cy clo hex imi de slowed down the degradation of the rs1800137T-containing minigene. These results demonstrate that synonymous SNP rs1800137 can lead to increased plasma FVIII levels due to decreased mRNA stability via translation-dependent mRNA degradation associated with codon optimality.  

# 1. Introduction  

Factor VIII (FVIII), a key protein in the intrinsic clotting cascade, is important for hemostasis. It is an essential blood clotting factor and a cofactor for factor IXa (FIXa), together forming a complex that converts factor X (FX) to activated Xa (FXa) in the presence of   $\mathtt{C a}^{2\,+}$    and phospholipids. Normal hemostasis requires at least   $25\%$   FVIII to be active. Hemophilia A, a genetic de ﬁ ciency in FVIII, causes increased bleeding and usually a ﬀ ects males  [1] . Alternatively, high FVIII levels are associated with a risk of arterial thrombosis  [2,3] . Our previous  

study also showed that high plasma FVIII levels are a prevalent and independent risk factor for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and neurological worsening after AIS  [4] .  

The FVIII molecule comprises three homologous A domains, two homologous C domains, and the unique B domain arranged as A1-A2-BA3-C1-C2  [5] . In plasma, FVIII circulates as a metal ion-linked he t ero dimer comprising a heavy chain composed of A1 (1 – 336), A2 (373 – 719), and B domains (741 – 1648), and a light chain composed of A3 (1690 – 2019), C1 (2020 – 2172), and C2 (2173 – 2332) domains. In the circulation, FVIII is strongly associated in a non covalent manner with its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which prevents premature assembly of the X-ase complex and protects FVIII from pro teo ly tic in activation and in activation by activated protein C, FIXa, and FXa  [6] . Plasma FVIII levels regulation is complex. The half-life of FVIII in the circulation depends on numerous factors, including its interaction with hepatic clearance receptors such as low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and low-density lipoprotein receptorrelated protein 1 (LRP1)  [7] . These proteins act together to catabolize FVIII, a process mediated by cell-surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs)  [8] . However, the relative contribution of both receptors to FVIII catabolism remains unclear. Mice lacking LDLR or LRP1 display FVIII levels that are normal or elevated up to 1.6-fold, respectively. In addition, mice with both LRP1 and LDLR de ﬁ ciency show a further increase in FVIII levels, and an approximately 5-fold increase in the length of time FVIII resides in the circulation, implying that LDLR can functionally compensate for LRP1 de ﬁ ciency and vice versa  [7] .  

The rs688 polymorphism in  LDLR  has been reported to predict FVIII coagulant activity, and T alleles have been associated with higher FVIII levels and coronary artery disease  [9] . Our previous genetic  LDLR variant analysis based on rs688 and rs5925 also found an association with AIS  [10] . Other genetic studies have also con ﬁ rmed that LRP1 plays an important role in FVIII metabolism. A conditionally induced LRP1 deletion in MX1cre + LRP1 ﬂ ox/ ﬂ ox   mice resulted in increased endogenous levels and prolonged FVIII circulation  [11] , and LRP1 has been shown to interact with FVIII and mediate its cellular uptake into the lysosomal degradation pathway  [12,13] . LRP1 is a member of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. This receptor family also includes low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein,  ${\tt g p330}$  . As with other members of the LDL receptor family, the modular structures within LRP1 include cysteine-rich complement-type repeats, EGF repeats,    $\upbeta$  -propeller domains, a trans membrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain  [15]  ( Fig. 1 ). FVIII interacts with LRP1 via an extended surface of multiple lysine residues that starts at the bottom of the C1 domain and winds around the FVIII molecule  [16] .  

Genome-wide association studies have succeeded in identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with several phenotypes. However, an associated SNP is likely to be part of a larger region of linkage d is equilibrium, making it di ﬃ cult to precisely identify the SNPs with a biological link to the phenotype. Therefore, we used functional SNP analysis in this study to evaluate whether there are associations between genetic  LRP1  polymorphisms and AIS through modulating plasma FVIII levels.  

We used the computational tool of SNP Function Prediction, FuncPred  [17]  ( http://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpfunc.htm ), to select the potential functional SNPs in  LRP1,  with any of the following predicted functionalities: (i) a ﬀ ecting the transcription factor-binding site activity in the putative promoter region (here, we de ﬁ ned promoter regions as 2-kb upstream of the  ﬁ rst exon); (ii) introduction of premature termination codons (PTCs); (iii) single-amino acid substitutions or changing the frame of the protein-coding region, resulting in alteration of protein structure or properties; (iv) a ﬀ ecting the microRNA-binding site activity; or (v) changing of splicing pattern or e ﬃ ciency by disrupting splice site, exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) or silencers (ESS).  

mRNA degradation, which is associated with mRNA stability and intimately coupled to translation, is important in the control of gene expression. In several genetic diseases caused by premature termination codons (PTCs), mRNA containing a PTC is subject to degradation via a mechanism called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD is a post transcriptional, but translation-dependent, mRNA quality control mechanism that recognizes and selectively degrades mRNA that contains a PTC that is 50 – 55 nt upstream from an exon – exon junction  [18] . Codon optimality has also been reported to be a major determinant of mRNA stability  [19] . We constructed expression vectors containing LRP1  minigenes and introduced them into human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells to determine whether there were allelespeciﬁc diﬀerences in LRP1 mRNA-splicing patterns or expressionlevels. Furthermore, to analyze if the above translation-dependent pathway involved in mRNA degradation, we measured transcribed levels of mRNA in the absence/presence of cy clo hex imi de as translation inhibitors.

the Department of Neurology, Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, between September 2013 and September 2015, and 134 control subjects with no history of stroke. Smoking and drinking behavior, and treatment history of hypertension (HTN), hyper lipid emi a, and diabetes mellitus (DM), were obtained by interview. All enrolled subjects underwent chest plain radio graph y and electrocardiograph y. Additionally, they underwent brain computed tomography and/or brain magnetic resonance imaging to de ﬁ ne the infarction area and exclude any cerebral hemorrhage. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of our hospital. Patients with major renal, hepatic, and endo cri no logical disorders, cancerous diseases, hemophilia, and recent infections were excluded. All enrolled subjects were Taiwanese. This study was designed and performed in accordance with the ethical principles established by the local institutional guidelines on clinical investigation. All participants gave their written informed consent for inclusion into the study. This study conformed to the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).  

# 2.1. Biochemical analysis and coagulation factor activity assays  

Complete blood count, blood glucose, blood type, serum lipid levels, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level were determined. The four-variable Modi ﬁ cation of Diet in Renal Disease formula was used to estimate the glomerular  ﬁ ltration rate (eGFR) from serum creatinine levels  [20] . Plasma FVIII levels were measured by a onestage FVIII activity assay using a standard method based on the activated partial th rom bop last in time. FVIII activity was expressed as international units/deciliter (IU/dL).  

# 2.2. SNPs and genotyping  

We used FuncPred  [17]  ( http://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpfunc.htm ) to select potential functional SNPs in  LRP1 . After we limited the SNPs to those with minor allele frequency  $>5\%$   in HapMap (Han Chinese in Beijing, China), we identi ﬁ ed eight potential functional SNPs (rs1799986, rs1800137, rs1800139, rs1800141, rs1800154, rs1800156, rs3741580, and rs10876966) and subjected them to further genotyping using locked nucleic acid technology ( Table 1 ;  Fig. 1 )  [21] .  

# 2.3. Evaluation of LRP1 mRNA expression in vivo  

LRP1 is also expressed in monocytes  [22] . Blood samples were collected using EDTA-coated tubes from 39 subjects (13 subjects with CC; 13, CT; and 13, TT genotypes). Polymorphonuclear leukocytes and peripheral blood mono nuclear cells were isolated by 1077/1119 histopaque double-gradient density cent ri fuga tion (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Total RNA was prepared and converted to cDNA in   $\scriptstyle{1-\upmu g}$  aliquots (QIAamp, Qiagen). Primers corresponding to sequences within LRP1  exons 7 and 11 were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampli ﬁ cation (Taq polymerase; TaKaRa) of cDNAs corresponding to LRP1  exons 7 – 11. The primer sequences were  $5^{\prime}$  -ATCGAC TGGCTGACA

PCR pro ﬁ les comprised pre-incubation at   $96~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $2\,\mathrm{{min}}$  , followed by de natura tion cycles at   $94\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,s,$  , annealing at   $58\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $40\,s,$  , and extension at  $\mathbf{72\,^{\circ}C}$   for  $50\,s$   (BIO-RAD C1000 Thermal cycler). The minimal number of PCR cycles necessary to discern products was performed, i.e., 25 cycles. PCR products were separated on   $2\%$   agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide on a  ﬂ uorescence imager (ChemiDoc XRS system). PCR products were quanti ﬁ ed using a DNA 1000 LabChip on an Agilent 2100 bio analyzer (Agilent Technologies; CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  

2.4. Evaluation of LRP1 expression in vitro  

# 2.4.1. Cell culture  

HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modi ﬁ ed Eagle's medium supplemented with   $10\%$   fetal bovine serum, 50 units/mL of ampicillin and   $300\,\upmu\mathrm{g/mL}$   of neomycin at  $37~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   in a humidi ﬁ ed  $5\%\;\mathsf{C O}_{2}/95\%$   air atmosphere.  

# 2.4.2. Generation of the minigene constructs  

Analysis of the mRNA stability and abundance was designed and performed using a minigene system to assess possible di ﬀ erences in mRNA st abilities between rs1800137 CC (rs1800137C) and TT (rs1800137T) genotypes.  LRP1  minigenes were generated from the genomic DNA of four individuals with rs1800137C and four individuals with rs1800137T genotype.  LRP1  genomic fragments containing exons 7 – 10 and the internal introns were ampli ﬁ ed with highﬁ delity polymerase (PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, Invitrogen) and primers  LRP1 Exon7F 5 ′ -GCCCTCCTGT AT AT CC ACT CT G-3 ′ , LRP1 Exon10R 5 ′ - C TAG CA GG TAC ACT CT GG GAC A $\cdot3^{\prime}$   (3004-bp product). PCR fragments were cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Exon 7 – 10 clones in the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector were digested ( Hin dIII and Xho I) to release the exon 7 – 10 inserts, which was then gel puri ﬁ ed and cloned into pCDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) prepared by digestion with  Hin dIII and  Xho I. The identities of the exon 7 – 10 minigenes were con ﬁ rmed by sequencing.  

The rs1800137 SNPs were interchanged between the rs1800137C and rs1800137T genomic  LRP1  backbones by site-directed mutagen es is (QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagen es is Kit, Stratagene). A small portion of the full-length clones containing rs1800137 was subcloned into the Litmus 28i vector (New England Biolab), producing a small vector with the pertinent  LRP1  sequence that could be utilized by a QuikChange multi-site-directed mutagen es is kit (Stratagene). Brie ﬂ y, the rs1800137C and rs1800137T clones were digested ( Hin dIII and Xho I) to release a fragment from the beginning of intron 6 to the end of exon 10. The fragments were gel puri ﬁ ed and ligated into  Hin dIII and Xho I-digested Litmus 28i. Mutagen es is of rs1800137 was performed with the following oligos:   $5^{\prime}$  -CAA GG GCC GCC AGACCATCAT-3 ′  (the underlined letter denotes the SNP) to convert the minor allele to the major allele and   $5^{\prime}$  -CAA GG GCC GCC AG ACT AT CAT $\cdot3^{\prime}$   to convert the major allele to the minor allele. Mutagen es is was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Positive clones were con ﬁ rmed by sequencing. Mutated fragments were then cut from Litmus 28i ( Hin dIII and  Xho I) and cloned back into the  Hin dIII and  Xho I-digested  LRP1 vector, with positive clones again con ﬁ rmed by sequencing.  

# 2.4.3. Cell transfection s  

LRP1  mRNA expression was evaluated by trans fec ting the  LRP1 minigene into HepG2 cells using Lip of ect amine 2000 reagent purchased from Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c (Waltham, MA, USA). Brie ﬂ y,   $1.5\,\times\,10^{5}$  cells per well were seeded in a six-well plate in  $2\,\mathrm{mL}$   of medium without  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{g}$  of  LRP1  minigene was mixed with   $6\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of Lip of ect amine 2000 reagent in   $50\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and added to each cell culture. Twenty-four hours after transfection, mRNA and protein were isolated. mRNA was analyzed for expression levels and splicing patterns by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as previously described  [23] . RNA was converted to cDNA (RevertAid  ﬁ rst-strand cDNA synthesis kit; Fermentas) and sequences corresponding to  LRP1 minigene splice products were PCR ampli ﬁ ed (Taq polymerase; TaKaRa). To evaluate the mRNA expression levels and splicing e ﬃ ciency with di ﬀ erent alleles of rs1800137 in the  LRP1  minigene, PCR was performed with an  LRP1  exon 7 sense primer   $5^{\prime}$  -ATCGA CTGGC TGACAG GCAAC-3 ′ , and to obviate endogenous  LRP1 , a vector-speci ﬁ c antisense primer   $5^{\prime}$  -CT C TAG ACT CC ACT CT GG GAC A $\cdot3^{\prime}$   was used. The PCR pro ﬁ les consisted of initial de natura tion at   $96~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $2\,\mathrm{{min}}$  followed by cycles of   $94\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,s,$  ,   $56\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,s$  ,   $\mathbf{72\,^{\circ}C}$   for  $45\,s_{\!}$  , and a  ﬁ nal extension at  $\mathbf{72\,^{\circ}C}$   for   $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$  . The minimal number of PCR cycles required to discern the products were performed (25 cycles). PCR products were separated on a   $2\%$   agarose gel (Invitrogen), and the identities were determined by gel puri ﬁ cation and direct sequencing (ABI PRISM 373 DNA Sequencer).  

Total RNA was extracted and   $1\,\upmu\mathrm{g}$   of RNA was used for RT-PCR analysis using transcript or reverse transcriptase polymerase in a   $20\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$  reaction at   $42\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $50\,\mathrm{{min}}$   with random hexamer primers   $(20\,\mathrm{{ng}/\upmu\mathrm{{L})}}$  . One microliter of cDNA was then ampli ﬁ ed in a   $50\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   reaction for 25 cycles of   $94\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (20 s),   $56\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (20 s) and   $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (30 s), as previously described  [24] . All PCR products were visualized on  $2\%$   agarose gels and quanti ﬁ ed using a DNA 1000 LabChip on an Agilent 2100 bio analyzer (Agilent Technologies; CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  

Protein samples were separated on  $10\%$   acrylamide gels by using SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinyl ide ne di ﬂ uoride (PVDF) membrane (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The membranes were probed with the following antibodies: anti-V5 (Invitrogen) and anti-GAPDH (Millipore, internal control) antibody. The blots were detected with western lightning plus ECL reagent (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).  

# 2.5. RNA stability assay  

For measurement of RNA decay,   $5\times10^{5}$    HepG2 cells were seeded in six-well plates. After  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  , cells were trans fec ted using Lip of ect amine  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{g}$   of  LRP1  minigene construct. On day 3, trans fec ted cells were incubated with   $2\,\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{mL}$  act in o my c in-D (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 0, 4, 8, and   $_{12\,\mathrm{h}}$  before RNA isolation. Subsequently, total RNA was extracted and used for  ﬁ rst-strand cDNA synthesis. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was generated each time from the same amount of total RNA. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to measure the exogenous  LRP1  transcripts. qRT-PCR products were also sequenced by direct sequencing (ABI PRISM 373 DNA Sequencer) to verify their speci ﬁ city.  

mRNA degradation associated with NMD or codon optimality is translation-dependent. To inhibit translation-dependent mRNA decay, cells were incubated with cy clo hex imi de (Sigma – Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The e ﬀ ect of cy clo hex imi de   $(300\,\upmu\mathrm{g/mL})$   on mRNA expression levels after rs1800137C or rs1800137T minigene transfection was investigated in HepG2 cells after an incubation of  $4\,\mathrm{h}$   using the same protocol, except that cells were not treated by act in o my c in-D. The treatment of trans fec ted cells with DMSO served as the vehicle control. mRNA levels are expressed in arbitrary units set to 1 for DMSO treated HepG2 cells.  

# 2.6. Statistics  

To assess the possible genetic predictors of FVIII levels,  LRP1 polymorphisms were included in a linear regression model adjusted for the main, known determinants of FVIII levels (gender, age, blood group O, body mass index (BMI), hsCRP, and eGFR).  

Biological and clinical variables were compared between AIS patients and controls using Student's  t -test and chi-square test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Clinical characteristics and genotype distribution in both groups were analyzed univariately. To assess the independent contribution of genotypes to AIS versus the control group, multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, adjusted for age, HTN, and DM. Odds ratios and   $95\%$  con ﬁ dence intervals (CIs) were calculated from the    $\upbeta$   coe ﬃ cients and standard errors of means.  P -value   $<\,0.05$   was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant.  

Allele and genotype frequencies were calculated for each locus and tested for Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was calculated for each SNP to decide whether the dominant or recessive inheritance model  ﬁ tted the data best, which is a model containing a low AIC value that would minimize the expected entropy. Statistical assessments were performed using SNPStats software ( http:// bioinfo.icon co logia.net/SNPstats )  [25] . Multiple testing correction was performed using the Bonferroni method and is noted in the text where signi ﬁ cant.

Signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erences were observed between the control and AIS groups for age, HTN, DM, and FVIII level. The mean FVIII level was signi ﬁ cantly higher in AIS patients than in controls   $(125.5~\pm~46.2$   vs.  $112.1~\pm~36.1\:\mathrm{I}$  U/dL;    $P=0.004$  ) ( Table 3 ). The genotypic distributions of the rs1799986, rs1800137, rs1800139, rs1800141, rs1800154, rs1800156, rs3741580, and rs10876966 polymorphisms of the AIS and control groups are summarized in  Table 4 . Although crude    $P$  -values indicated a possible association between the genotypes of rs1800141 and the AIS group, Bonferroni correction rendered this association insigni ﬁ cant.  

# 3.3. E ﬀ ect of rs1800137 on LRP1 expression  

# 3.3.1. In vivo analysis  

To investigate whether genotypes of rs1800137 are associated with LRP1  exon 7 – 11 mRNA expression levels in vivo, we evaluated  LRP1 exon 7 – 11 mRNA levels in blood samples obtained from 39 subjects (13 subjects with CC, 13 subjects with CT, and 13 subjects with TT genotypes). Expression levels were analyzed using PCR to amplify LRP1  cDNA from exons 7 to 11, allowing detection and relative quant it ation of  LRP1  exon 7 – 11 mRNA. Compared with   $\mathsf{C C}+\mathsf{C T}$  genotypes, the TT genotype was associated with decreased exon 7 – 11 mRNA expression levels  $(1.71~\pm~0.33$  vs.  $3.75\;\pm\;0.87\,\mathrm{ng}/\upmu\mathrm{L},$   $P\;<\;0.001$  ;  Fig. 2 ).  

# 3.3.2. In vitro analysis  

To evaluate whether rs1800137 is itself functional or only linked to functional SNPs, we evaluated rs1800137 speci ﬁ cally using a minigene transfection approach. We began this process by cloning  LRP1  exons 7 – 10, along with the intervening introns, from the genomic DNA of four rs1800137C individuals and four rs1800137T individuals. These  LRP1 minigenes were trans fec ted into HepG2 cells. RNA was isolated   $24\,\mathrm{h}$  later, and mRNA levels and splicing e ﬃ ciency were evaluated. We evaluated the e ﬀ ects of rs1800137 speci ﬁ cally using site-directed mutagen es is to swap only rs180017 within the minigenes: minigenes containing rs1800137C were converted to the minor T allele  $(\mathrm{rs1800137C->t})$  and rs1800137T minigenes were converted to rs1800137C   $(\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}1800137\mathrm{T}{\rightarrow}\mathrm{c})$  . Resultant clone sequencing demonstrated the speci ﬁ city of the mutagen es is. When these minigenes were evaluated for mRNA levels, we found that converting rs1800137C to rs1800137C → t reduced mRNA expression levels. In contrast, convert

Following plasmid transfection with identical amounts of DNA, western blot analyses also revealed the similar results in protein expression as above ( Fig. 4 ). Hence, the major and minor rs1800137 alleles are su ﬃ cient to account for the di ﬀ erences in mRNA expression levels regardless of haplotypic background.

# 3.4. Analysis of mRNA stability  

HepG2 cells were trans fec ted with  LRP1  minigene to investigate the stability of mRNA by qRT-PCR after treatment with act in o my c in-D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis. The sixteen (four rs1800137C, four  $\mathrm{{r}s1800137C\mathrm{{\rightarrow}t,}}$  , four rs1800137T, and four rs1800137T  $\multimap{}$  ) constructs were then trans fec ted. Compared with rs1800137C, rs1800137C → t reduced mRNA stability. In contrast, compared with rs1800137T,  $\mathrm{{rs}1800137T{\rightarrow}c}$   increased the mRNA stability ( Table 5 ). These results indicated that rs1800137T variants decayed faster than rs1800137C transcripts, suggesting that the di ﬀ erence in  LRP1  mRNA levels between rs1800137C and rs1800137T may be caused by a di ﬀ erence in the stability of RNA species ( Table 5 ).  

The role of translation-dependent mRNA decay in mRNA stability was evaluated by trans fec ting HepG2 cells with  LRP1  minigenes incubated with or without cy clo hex imi de. Protein synthesis inhibition by cy clo hex imi de resulted in increased  LRP1  mRNA levels containing rs1800137T/rs1800137C → t but had no signi ﬁ cant e ﬀ ect on the amount of correctly spliced rs1800137C/rs1800137T  $\mathbf{\Gamma}\mathbf{\Gamma}\mathbf{\partial}\mathbf{r}\mathbf{C}$   mRNA, indicating that the e ﬀ ect may be speci ﬁ c to translation-dependent mRNA decay ( Fig. 5 ).  

# 4. Discussion  

Hyper coa gul able states are conditions in which the nature or composition of the blood encourages coagulation. We have previously shown that both increased plasma FVIII levels and shortened activated partial th rom bop last in time (a functional determination of the intrinsic coagulation pathway) are associated with AIS  [4,26] . Although FVIII levels were higher in AIS patients compared with controls in this study

For each of the rs1800137C and rs1800137T minigenes, site-directed mutagen es is was used to convert the C allele to the minor  $\mathrm{T}$   allele (rs1800137C to  $\mathrm{\ttrs1800137C-t})$   or vice versa (rs1800137T to r  $\mathsf{\tilde{s}1800137T{\rightarrow}c}$  .

LRP1 has been shown to bind to a number of ligands with high a ﬃ nity thereby impacting a variety of biological processes  [27] , including lipoprotein metabolism, protease degradation, lysosomal enzyme activation, and cellular entry of bacterial toxins and viruses  [15] . Llorente-Cortes et al. have demonstrated that in human vascular smooth muscle cells, LRP1 mediates the internal iz ation of aggregated LDL  [28,29] . LRP1-mediated aggregated LDL uptake could be one of the main mechanisms for intracellular lipid accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells  [30] . An increase in LRP1 expression has also been described in advanced at hero sclerotic plaques  [31]  and in patients with coronary obstruction [32] . Indeed, the C allele of rs1800137 was associated with both high LRP1 and low FVIII levels; thus, we were tempted to speculate that the at hero protective role of low FVIII could be counterbalanced by the pro a the rogen ic action of high LRP1. According to the putative net sum of e ﬀ ects on the  ﬁ nal phenotype, the risk of AIS was unchanged in our population.  

In vitro LRP1 can bind FVIII at the cell surface and mediate its transport to the intracellular degradation pathway. The FVIII – LRP1 interaction involves the FVIII light chain, and FVIII – vWF complex formation regulates LRP1 binding. Importantly, vWF blocks the binding of FVIII to LRP1  [13] . LRP1 inhibition by a single bolus administration of receptor-associated protein, a classical antagonist of LRP1, has a signi ﬁ cant inhibitory e ﬀ ect on the clearance of infused FVIII in the absence of vWF, thus further supporting the involvement of LRP1 in the clearance mechanisms of FVIII  [33] . FVIII molecules (approximately  $95\%–98\%$  ) are mainly found in complex with vWF in blood. Upon activation by thrombin, FVIII dissociates from the complex to interact with FIXa in the coagulation cascade. No longer protected by vWF, activated FVIII is pro teo ly tic ally in activated in the process and quickly cleared from the blood stream  [34] . With respect to the association

Fig. 5.  E ﬀ ect of cy clo hex imi de treatment on  LRP1  mRNA levels in HepG2 cells. The e ﬀ ect of rs1800137 was evaluated speci ﬁ cally using site-directed mutagen es is to swap only rs180017 within the minigenes. A. Minigenes containing rs1800137C were converted to the minor   $\mathrm{T}$   allele   $(\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}1800137\mathrm{C}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{t})$  . B. rs1800137T minigenes were converted to rs1800137C   $\mathbf{(r s1800137T{\rightarrow}c)}$  ). The levels of rs1800137T and rs1800137C  LRP1  mRNA were quanti ﬁ ed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays in HepG2 cells treated with or without with cy clo hex imi de for   $^{4\,\mathrm{h}}$  . mRNA levels are expressed in arbitrary units set to 1 for DMSO treated HepG2 cells. Error bars indicate standard deviation. (CHX, cy clo hex imi de;  $^{*}P=0.001$  ,    $^{\#}P\;<\;0.001)$  ).  

between rs1800137 and plasma levels of FVIII, the lack of available data on vWF represents a potential limitation. However, it has been demonstrated that    ${}^{125}\mathrm{I}$  -labeled FVIII is selectively removed from the vWF – FVIII complex and internalized in cells expressing LRP1, even in the presence of a large excess of vWF  [12] . vWF – FVIII complex can bound to HSPGs at the cellular surface, leading to dissociation of the complex. Once dissociated, FVIII is transferred to LRP1, whereas vWF is released into the circulation  [8] . A small but signi ﬁ cant portion of the FVIII molecules   $(5–8\%)$   circulate as a free protein  [35,36] . As such, FVIII light chain is unprotected by vWF, allowing LRP1-mediated clearance. Because free FVIII is cleared 4- to 6-fold more rapidly than vWF-bound FVIII  [37] , the loss of free FVIII is compensated by a continuous  ﬂ ow of vWF-bound to free FVIII in order to maintain equilibrium. Moreover, it is noteworthy that our analysis about FVIII determinants has been adjusted also for ABO blood group, which in turn has been proposed to a ﬀ ect FVIII levels by di ﬀ erential glycosylation and thus metabolism/catabolism of vWF  [38,39] .  

Several genetic polymorphisms in the  LRP1  gene have been reported to be associated with FVIII levels. Marchetti et al. reported that the G allele of the  LRP1 -25C/G (rs35282763) polymorphism, which predicts an increased LRP1 expression, was associated with   $15\%$   and  $18\%$   mean reductions in FVIII activity and protein levels, respectively  [40] . In addition, the N allele of the  LRP1 /D2080N (rs34577247) polymorphism has been associated with a slight decrease in plasma FVIII levels  $(90.4~\pm~8.7\$   vs.   $102.2~\pm~3.5\,\mathrm{AU}/\mathrm{ML}$  ,    $P=0.02$  )  [41] . Moreover, both the C663T (rs1800127) and C766T (rs1799986) polymorphisms of the LRP1  gene have been associated with elevated levels of FVIII and venous thr ombo embolism  [42,43] . In particular,  LRP1  C663T has been shown to in ﬂ uence plasma FVIII levels independently of blood group, Creactive protein, and vWF levels  [43] . In the present study, only rs1800137 showed an association with plasma FVIII levels (TT vs.  $\mathsf{C C}+\mathsf{C T}$  , 23.5 IU/dL;   $95\%$   CI, 7.4 – 39.5 IU/dL;  $P=0.0044$  ) among the eight functional SNPs in  LRP1  ( Table 2 ). The  LRP1  genetic polymorphism rs1800137 is not an uncommon SNP within the Chinese population, with T/T individuals representing   $\sim\!8\%$   of the population (dbSNP, build 132). It is unclear if these results can be applied to other racial groups, as this population was solely comprised of Taiwanese patients. However, although genetic markers for proposed gene-disease associations vary in frequency across populations, their biological impact on the risk for common diseases may usually be consistent across traditional racial boundaries  [44] .  

Increasing evidence suggests that eukaryotic RNA turnover is a key regulatory step in gene expression, and an important quality control mechanism. The cytoplasmic level of mRNA and, hence protein, depends not only on its rates of synthesis, processing, and transport, but also on its rate of decay. Many diseases are caused by the dys regulation of mRNA decay  [45] . A recent study showed that up to  $50\%$   of human genes with coding SNPs present with allelic variation in gene expression  [46] . The alteration of mRNA instability motifs may well prove to be a more general phenomenon than previously thought. We used HepG2 cells in mRNA stability assays using the transcription inhibitor act in o my c in D. Using minigene transfection-based stability assays and site-directed mutagen es is, we were able to show that rs1800137T confers abnormal RNA stability to  LRP1  transcripts ( Table 5 ). This indicates that in subjects bearing rs1800137T, the lowest  LRP1  mRNA level may have resulted from a rapid degradation of codon variants produced by rs1800137T.  

SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation in humans. SNPs introducing PTCs can alter the stability and function of transcripts and proteins and thus are considered biologically important. rs1800137, located in exon 8 of the  LRP1,  has been identi ﬁ ed in silico as an ESE using the ESE ﬁ nder program  [47]  ( http://rulai.cshl.edu/ tools/ESE2/ ). The exclusion of exon 8 is predicted to cause a frameshift in exon 9, which results in three PTCs in exon 9. In vitro studies such as minigene analyses are used to directly verify whether rs1800137 a ﬀ ects splicing e ﬃ ciency or mRNA expression levels in this study. Screening of the sixteen  LRP1  minigene trans fec ted HepG2 cell lines revealed allelespeci ﬁ c di ﬀ erences in  LRP1  mRNA expression levels ( Fig. 3 ). All samples with rs1800137C were found to be expressed at higher levels than those with rs  ${\displaystyle1800137{\tt C}\rightarrow{\tt t}.}$   In contrast, samples with rs1800137T were found to be expressed at lower levels than those with  $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}1800137\mathrm{T}\rightarrow\mathsf{c}$  . Although there is translation-dependent degradation of    $L R P1~\mathrm{mRNA}$   with rs1800137T, alternative splicing of  LRP1  without inclusion of exon 8 was not identi ﬁ ed in this study. Except for the dependence on translation, our data do not provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that degradation occurs via an NMD-like mechanism.  

Genome-wide RNA decay analysis revealed that stable mRNAs are enriched in codons designated optimal, whereas unstable mRNAs contain predominately non-optimal codons  [19] . A major determinant of mRNA half-life is the codon-dependent rate of translational elongation. The DEAD-box protein Dhh1p is a sensor of codon optimality that targets an mRNA for decay  [48] . Inhibiting elongation with cycloheximide can lead to stabilization of mRNAs  [49] . The codon optimality of ACC and ACT has been reported to be 1.0714 and 0.9522 in humans respectively  [50] .  

To test this hypothesis, cells were treated with cy clo hex imi de, a molecule known to prevent protein synthesis. In an attempt to explain the degradation of codon variant RNA, we then investigated the role of the rs1800137T mutation. Reversal of this mutation to the wild genotype   $\cdot s1800137\mathrm{T}\rightarrow\mathsf{c}$   was performed to see whether there is signi ﬁ cant e ﬀ ect on the decay of codon variants. Adding cy clo hex imi de resulted in a marked accumulation of codon variants through an inhibition of its fast degradation but had no e ﬀ ect on the degradation of wild-type RNA ( Fig. 5 ), suggesting that functional translation machinery is required for degradation of rs1800137T  LRP1  mRNA. Therefore, we hypothesize that converting non-optimal codon ACT to optimal codon ACC increases mRNA stability in this study.  

In conclusion, we demonstrated the functional consequences of the LRP1  genetic polymorphism rs1800137 leading to increased FVIII levels. Furthermore, we showed through a comprehensive analysis of LRP1  mRNA expression levels that rs1800137C and rs1800137T result in di ﬀ erent mRNA st abilities, which are likely to be regulated by di ﬀ erent codon optimality. This work demonstrates that codon optimization exists as a potential mechanism to  ﬁ nely tune levels of  LRP1 mRNAs, and ultimately, FVIII levels.
