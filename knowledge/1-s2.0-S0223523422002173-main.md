Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability and death. The development of neuro protect ants is an emerging strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of 1,3,5-triaryl substituent triazole derivatives by introducing a phenolic group and phenyl ring to 3,5-diaryl substituents oxadiazole. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis showed that compounds with alkyl groups or with substituents at the 3-position possessed better protective effects. Among the derivatives, 3,5-dimethyl substituted compound  24  exhibited the best neuro protective effect with weak cyto toxicity. Compound  24  possessed a high plasma protein binding rate, moderate hERG inhibition, low acute toxicity, and suitable p harm a co kinetic properties. In vivo experiments demonstrated that compound  24  exerted a protective effect by reducing cerebral infarction size, improving neurological behavior, and restoring redox balance in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats. Further investigation indicated that compound  24  exerted a protective effect against sodium nitro prussi de (SNP) induced cell damage by scavenging intracellular reactive oxygen species and restoring mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, compound  24  induced the nuclear translocation of Nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor (Nrf2) and promoted the generation of anti oxidative proteins, including Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments indicated that compound  24  might activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway by interacting with the Keap1 Kelch domain. Taken together, these facts indicate that compound  24  might have potential in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) is a crucial endogenous regulator that maintains cellular redox balance [ 9 , 10 ]. Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 combines with Kelch-like ECHassociated protein 1 (Keap1) in the cytosol and remains at a low level by ubiquitin ation and degradation [ 11 ]. In the presence of electro phil es and oxidants, Nrf2 is released from the inhibition of Keap1 and trans locates into the nucleus [ 12 ], where it initiates the transcription of genes driven by an antioxidant response element (ARE) and subsequently promotes the expression of anti oxidative proteins [ 13 ]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Nrf2 signaling pathway is an essential cellular defense mechanism against ischemia e reperfusion injury in stroke [ 14 e 17 ]. These ﬁ ndings suggest that Nrf2 activation may be a viable strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke.  

# 1. Introduction  

Acute ischemic stroke is a cerebral disease with a high incidence that causes death and long-term disability worldwide [ 1 , 2 ]. During the ischemia e reperfusion process of ischemic stroke, oxidative stress and in ﬂ ammation lead to neuronal dysfunction, causing irreversible damage to the brain [ 3 , 4 ]. The use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an effective clinical treatment strategy for ischemic stroke but has the limitation of a narrow therapeutic window [ 5 ]. There is still an urgent need to develop ef ﬁ cacious anti-ischemic stroke medications. In this regard, developing neuro protect ants against oxidative stress and in ﬂ ammation has been considered a potential treatment for cerebral ischemic injury [ 6 e 8 ].  

Edaravone is a free radical scavenger with a 1-phenyl-3-methyl5-pyrazolone structure. It is an approved neuro protect ant that is used for the treatment of ischemic stroke and amyotrophic lateral

sclerosis [ 18 , 19 ]. Edaravone is widely used as a positive control in neuro protective studies because of its excellent anti oxidative effect [ 20 , 21 ]. Previous reports demonstrate that the pyrazolone structure of edaravone can interact with free radicals [ 22 ]. The phenyl group improves lip oph ili city and helps it permeate into the brain [ 23 ].  

Oxadiazole derivatives have been widely investigated for their anti oxidative and anti-in ﬂ ammatory activities in developing neuro protective agents [ 24 , 25 ]. Recently, the 3,5-diaryl substituent oxadiazole was found to show favorable activity in activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway [ 26 , 27 ]. You et al. reported that M416-0271 was capable of protecting PC12 cells against  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$  -induced damage by Nrf2 activation [ 28 ] (see  Fig. 1 ). Moreover, the oxadiazole derivative DDO-7263 protected brain tissue against MPTP-induced subacute Parkinson's disease [ 29 ]. Recently, Mohamed and coworkers introduced a phenolic group to the oxadiazole core and obtained compounds with good anti oxidative effects by inducing Nrf2 and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 30 ]. This inspired us to conclude that the phenolic substituent oxadiazole might have a potential protective effect in treating cerebral ischemic injury. Triazole has electronic properties similar to those of oxadiazole. It was reported that triazole derivatives also had the ability to activate Nrf2 [ 31 ]. For example, MIND4-17, a 1,2,4-triazole derivative, can activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway and exert a neuro protective effect against Huntington's disease [ 32 , 33 ].  

In the interest of discovering novel neuro protect ants for treating ischemic stroke, we replaced the 1,2,4-oxadiazole core with 1,2,4- triazole to obtain the phenolic substituent triazole skeleton (see  Fig. 2 ). An extra phenolic hydroxyl group was introduced to enhance the potency of ROS elimination. Because blood brain barrier permeability is an essential prerequisite of neuro protect ants, and drawing inspiration from the structure of edaravone, we added a phenyl group to the skeleton to improve its lip oph ili city, which may help the compound permeate the blood brain barrier and protect brain cells.  

To further investigate the SAR, a series of compounds with different substituents on the phenyl group were synthesized. The

derivatives were preliminarily screened for their neuro protective activity via an SNP-induced apoptosis model in PC12 cells. The most promising derivatives were evaluated for their cyto toxicity on PC12 and HaCaT cells to assess their safety pro ﬁ les. Then, the optimal compound was further tested for its drug-like properties (acute toxicity, hERG inhibition, p harm a co kinetic properties, and protein binding rate) and therapeutic effect against cerebral ischemic injury. The anti oxidative effect was evaluated by scavenging ROS and restoring mitochondrial trans membrane potential. In addition, the potency of the compound in activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway was determined by western blotting. A Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay was carried out to determine the target of the compound.

# 2.3. In vitro experiments  

# 2.3.1. Cell cultures  

The rat adrenal phe och romo cyto ma cell lines (PC12) and human immortal keratin o cyte lines (HaCaT) were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with   $5\%\,(\mathrm{v}/$  v) FBS and   $5\%$   (v/v) HS in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere of   $5\%\subset O_{2}$   at  $37\ ^{\circ}\mathsf{C}.$  .  

# 2.3.2. Measurement of cell viability and cyto toxicity  

The MTT assay was used to determine the cell viability and cyto toxicity. In the measurements of cell viability, PC12 cells were d in 96-well plates at a density of   $5\,\times\,10^{3}$    cells per well for 24 h. After p retreating the cells with a concentration gradient  $(1~\upmu\mathsf{M},5~\upmu\mathsf{M}$  , and   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}.$  ) of compounds for  $^{2\textrm{h}}$  ,   $400~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP was added for incubation for  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The positive group was treated with edavarone, and the control group was cultured without disposition of compounds. Afterward,   $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of MTT solution   $(5\ \mathrm{m}\mathrm{g/m}\mathrm{l})$   was added to each well and incubated at   $37~^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   for   $_{3\textrm{h}}$  . The super nat ant was removed and next  $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of DMSO was added to each well of 96-well plates. Then, the solutions were mixed thoroughly to dissolve MTT-formazan crystals. The absorbance values were recorded at   $570\;\mathrm{nm}$   by an EPOCH 2 microplate reader (BioTek Devices). The cyto toxicity toward HaCaT and PC12 cells was evaluated with different concentrations of test compounds. The experiments were repeated at least three times.  

# 2.3.3. Measurement of plasma protein binding rate  

The binding rate of plasma protein was detected by equilibrium dialysis. Human plasma (HMN575149) was obtained from BioIVT

 (New York, USA), and Sprague e Dawley (SD) rat plasma

 (R210142146) was obtained from IPHASE (Beijing, China). The dialysis membranes were  ﬁ rst soaked in ultrapure water for  $60\,\mathrm{{min}}$  and dialysis buffer for  $20~\mathrm{min}$   before being loaded into a 96-well equilibrium dialysis plate (HTDialysis, USA). Three microliter s of compound  24  (  $\cdot10~\mathrm{mM})$  ) was added to   $597~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of blank plasma solution, followed by vortexing for 2 min to obtain the plasma sample. Dialysis buffer was prepared by dissolving   $1.42\,\mathrm{~g~}\,\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{HPA}4$   and  $8.77\;\mathrm{g\;N a C l}$   in  $100\,\mathrm{ml}$   deionized water. Afterward,   $120\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of plasma sample and dialysis buffer were added to adjacent wells of the dialysis plate. The plate was incubated for  $6\,\mathrm{h}$   at   $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  at 100 rpm on an orbital shaker. After incubation,   $50~\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of the samples were collected from each well and analyzed by LC e MS/MS to determine the concentrations of the compounds in the buffer and plasma solution. The assay was performed in duplicate.  

# 2.3.4. Measurement of stability in human plasma  

$4~{\upmu\mathrm{L}}$   of the test compound   $(200~\upmu\mathrm{M})$   was added to   $396~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of human plasma, and the mixture was incubated at   $37\,^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  . Aliquots of  $50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   were taken from the reaction samples at 0, 15, 30, 60, and  $120\,\mathrm{min}$  . The reactions were terminated by the addition of  $450\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of cold acetonitrile containing internal standards. The samples were vortexed for   $10\,\mathrm{\min}$  , followed by cent ri fuga tion at   $^{3,220\mathrm{~g~}}$   for  $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$  . The super nat ant was  ﬁ ltered, and the  ﬁ ltrate was analyzed by LC e MS/MS. Prop an the line was used as a positive control for human plasma, and mevinolin was used as a positive control for rat plasma. The assay was performed in duplicate.  

# 2.3.5. Measurement of hERG inhibition  

The hERG inhibition was evaluated by measuring ele c trophy siological changes. The electrophysiology performance was recorded on an automated patch clamp system (QPatch   $48~\mathrm{X}$  , Sophion) at  $24\ ^{\circ}{\mathsf{C}}.$  . HEK-293 cells (Institute of SARL Creacell, A-0320) stably expressing the hERG channel were used for measurement and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with  $10\%$   FBS and   $0.8\,\mathrm{mg/ml}$   G418 at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  . Before testing, cells were placed on the QPlate chip to form a whole-cell recording mode. The hERG current was recorded at a holding potential of    $-80~\mathrm{mV}$   and then de polarized to    $-50~\mathrm{mV}$   for  $0.5\ s$   to test the leak current. Then, the voltage was de polarized to  $30\,\mathrm{mV}$   for  $2.5\,s.$  . The peak tail current was induced by a re polarizing pulse to    $-50\:\mathrm{mV}$   for  $4\,s.$  . An interpulse interval of 10 s would allow enough time for recovery from in activation to observe the effect of the test article on the hERG tail current. A 0.5 s of  $-50\,\mathrm{mV}$   was used for leakage current detection. Compound  24  was tested in serial concentrations (  $100\;\upmu\mathrm{M},$  ,  $33.33\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$  ,  $10\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$  ,  $3.33\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$  , and  $1~{\upmu\mathrm{M}}.$  ). The working concentrations of cisapride were   $300\;\mathrm{nm},100\;\mathrm{nm},30\;\mathrm{nm}$  ,  $10~\mathrm{{nM}}$  , and  $3\;\mathrm{nm}$  .

# 2.4.1. Acute toxicity test  

${\tt B A L B}/{\tt c}$   mice weighing   $_{18-22\ \mathrm{~g~}}$   were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Experiments were performed on the basis of the standard guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals, and all procedures were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care Committee.  

Acute toxicity experiments were carried out according to the up-and-down procedure [ 34 ]. The mice were intra peritoneal ly injected with increasing doses of compound  24  (175, 550,  $1000\,\mathrm{mg/}$  kg). After administration, the mice were observed for 7 days using several indicators, including appearance, behavior, secretions and excreta. The acute toxicity of compound  24  was presented as a  $50\%$  lethal dose   $(\mathrm{LD}_{50})$  ), which was calculated by using the AOT425 statistical program.  

# 2.4.2. P harm a co kinetic studies in SD rats  

Sprague e Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200 e 230 g were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Compound  24  was dissolved in solvent and administered to the rats by intra peritoneal   $(5\;\mathrm{mg/kg})$   and intravenous   $(5\:\mathrm{mg/kg})$   injection. Blood samples were collected at 5, 10, 18, and   $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$   and 1, 2, 3, 6, 8,10, and   $24\,\mathrm{h}$  . The serum was collected by cent ri fuga tion at  $3700\ \mathrm{rpm}$   and kept at    $-20~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  . After protein precipitation, the plasma concentration of the samples was detected by LC/MS/MS. P harm a co kinetic values were calculated by PKSolver 2.0 software.  

# 2.4.3. Establishment of a rat model of ischemic stroke  

Male SD rats   $(180{-}220\,\mathrm{\g})$   were randomly divided into six groups with 12 rats in each group: the control group; MCAO group; low-dose group (compound  24 ,   $3\,\mathrm{\meg/kg})$  ; medium-dose group

 (compound  24 ,   $10\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$  ; high-dose group (compound  24 ,   $30\,\mathrm{mg/}$   $\mathrm{kg})$  ; and positive control group (edaravone injection,   $5\;\mathrm{mg/kg})$  .  

The protocol of the MCAO experiment was executed according to the reported literature [ 35 ]. Brie ﬂ y, the rats were anesthetized with  $4\%$   iso ﬂ urane and maintained with  $2{-}3\%$   iso ﬂ urane. Then, the left common carotid artery and external and internal carotid arteries of the rats were exposed by a midline neck incision. Afterward, the internal carotid artery was nipped with a hemostatic clamp. A 4 e 0 nylon thread was inserted into the operative artery and reached the arteriae cerebri anteriorly after removal of the clamp. Intra cranial blood  ﬂ ow was occluded for   $1.5\textrm{h}$   before the ﬁ lament was retracted to restore cerebral perfusion. The compounds or saline were administered by intra peritoneal injection 1 h before the operation and   $^{\mathrm{~4~h~}}$   after reperfusion. The rats in the control group were operated on similarly to those in the experimental group but without arterial occlusion.  

# 2.4.4. Measurement of neurological de ﬁ cits  

After  $^{24\textrm{h}}$   of MCAO operation, Zea Longa's neurological tests [ 36 ] were conducted to evaluate the e tho logical characteristics of the rats. Neurological de ﬁ cits were quanti ﬁ ed as follows: 0 points, no observable de ﬁ cits; 1 point, failure to fully extend the contralateral forelimb; 2 points, circling to the left; 3 points, hemiplegia; and 4 points, loss of consciousness.  

# 2.4.5. Measurement of biochemical indicators and cerebral infarct area  

The rats were sacri ﬁ ced after measurement of neurological de ﬁ cits, and whole-blood samples were obtained from the abdominal vein. The serum was collected by cent ri fuga tion and kept at    $-20\,^{\circ}\mathsf{C}.$  . Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malo ndi aldehyde (MDA) were evaluated according to the detection kits (Beyotime, China).  

2,3,5-Tri phenyl tetra zo liu m chloride (TTC) staining was performed to measure cerebral infarction. After sacri ﬁ ce, the brains of the rats were collected and frozen at  $-20~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for   $25~\mathrm{min}$  . Then, the brains were sliced into  ﬁ ve coronal sections, which were subsequently incubated in   $1\%$   TTC at   $37~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for  $20\ \mathrm{min}$   and immobilized with   $4\%$   para formaldehyde overnight. After staining, the normal part of the tissue turned red, while the infarct part turned white. The samples were recorded by photography, and the infarction status was quanti ﬁ ed via Image Pro Plus software.

After that, the former culture medium was replaced by serumfree medium with   $12~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   Hoechst 33258 (  $\cdot12~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml})$  . Cells were incubated at   $37~^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{min}$   and then washed with serum-free medium three times. Fluorescence imaging was recorded on a ﬂ uorescence microscope (Olympus, FV3000, Japan). The control group was treated without a compound.  

# 2.5.2. Detecting the expression levels of ROS  

PC12 cells were cultured in laser confocal dishes for  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The cells were treated with   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   compound  24  for   $^{\mathrm{~2~h~}}$   and subsequently exposed to  $400~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for an additional  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . Then, the former culture medium was replaced by serum-free medium with  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   DCFH-DA   $(20\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$  . The cells were incubated at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$  and washed with the medium three times. Relative  ﬂ uorescent imaging of ROS was recorded on a  ﬂ uorescence microscope (Olympus, FV3000, Japan). The control group was treated without a compound.  

# 2.5.3. Changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)  

PC12 cells were seeded to adhere in laser confocal dishes for  $^{24\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The cells were treated with   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   compound  24  for   $^{\mathrm{~2~h~}}$  , followed by treatment with   $400\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for an additional  $24\,\mathrm{h}$  . The former culture medium was replaced by JC-1 detection solution, and the cells were incubated at   $37~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20 min before washing with JC-1 solution buffer three times. Relative  ﬂ uorescent imaging of mitochondrial membrane potential was recorded on a  ﬂ uorescence microscope (Olympus, FV3000, Japan). The control group was treated without compound.  

# 2.5.4. Western blot analysis  

PC12 cells were pretreated with gradient concentrations of compound  24  (2.5, 5, and   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for  $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$  . After the cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer for  $30~\mathrm{min}$   and centrifuged, whole-cell proteins were collected from the super nat ant. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were isolated according to the protocol of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction kits (Beyotime, China), respectively. The protein concentration was determined by a bic inchon in ic acid (BCA) assay kit.  

Equal amounts of proteins were separated via SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinyl ide ne  ﬂ uoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked in  $5\%$   skim milk solution for   $^{2\textrm{h}}$   at room temperature, followed by incubation at  $4\,^{\circ}C$   overnight with Nrf2 primary antibody (1:1000), HO-1 primary antibody (1:1000), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase (NQO1) primary antibody (1:1000), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) primary antibody (1:1000), or    $\upbeta$  -actin antibody (1:1000). Subsequently, the PVDF membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000). Electro chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate was used for imaging, and the bands were recorded on an automated chemiluminescence imaging analysis system (Tanon 5200, China) and quanti ﬁ ed via ImageJ.  

# 2.5.5. Expression and puri ﬁ cation of the Keap1 Kelch domain  

The PET28a expression vectors that contained cDNA encoding the Kelch domain of human Keap1 (UniProt Q14145, residues 321 e 609) were purchased from AtaGenix (Wuhan, China).  Escherichia coli  BL21 (DE3) cells were cultured with  $2~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  of plasmid in LB medium supplemented with  $1\%$   glucose and   $30\,\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   kanamycin at  $37~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for   $^{1\textrm{h}}$  . Then, the cells were seeded onto the plate with solid medium for incubation overnight. A single bacterial colony was transferred to  $30\,\mathrm{{ml}}$   of LB medium and incubated at   $37\,^{\circ}\mathsf{C}/220$   rpm until the  ${\mathrm{OD}}_{600}$   reached 0.5 e  $60\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of cell culture was transferred to   $200\ \mathrm{ml}$   of LB medium and grown at   $37\ \mathrm{{}^{\circ}C}/$   $220~\mathrm{rpm}$   overnight, followed by the addition of  $800~\mathrm{ml}$   of LB medium and incubation for an additional  $_{3\,\mathrm{h}}$  . IPTG (1:1000) was added to the medium to induce protein expression. Then, the cells were collected by cent ri fuga tion and suspended in   $30~\mathrm{ml}$   PBS (  $10~\mathrm{mM}$  phosphate, pH 7.4,   $145~\mathrm{{mM}~N a C l.}$  ), followed by lysis with an ultrasonic cell crusher at  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  . The cell lysate was centrifuged to collect the super nat ant with crude protein. The crude protein was puri ﬁ ed by Ni-af ﬁ nity chromatography with imidazole gradient elution  $.0{-}300\:\mathrm{mM}$   imidazole in lysis buffer). The protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE for purity and concentrated to  $4\;\mathrm{mg/m}\mathrm{l}$  .  

# 2.5.6. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)  

The SPR assay was performed on a Biacore   $8\mathrm{~k~}$   (GE Healthcare, Sweden) at  $25\,^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  according to previous reports [ 37 , 38 ]. The positive control FITC-Nrf2 peptide probe (FITC-LDEETGEF-OH) was purchased from Synpeptide (Nanjing, China). The running buffer consisted of PBS (  $10~\mathrm{{mM}}$   phosphate, pH 7.4, 145 mM NaCl),  $5\%$   DMSO and   $0.05\%$   P20 surfactant. Compound  24  was diluted with running buffer in a concentration gradient   $3.125~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  ,   $6.25~\ensuremath{\upmu\mathrm{M}}$  ,   $12.5~\ensuremath{\upmu\mathrm{M}}$  ,  $25~{\upmu\mathrm{M}}$  ,  $50~\upmu\mathrm{M}.$  . Brie ﬂ y, the sensor surface of the CM5 sensor chip was activated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl amino prop yl) carbo di imi de hydrochloride (EDC) and  $N\cdot$  -hydroxy succ in imi de (NHS). The Keap1 Kelch domain was immobilized on the active surface. Then, ethanolamine was used to block the unoccupied surface area. The immobilization level of Keap1 was approximately 1600 response units (RU). Compound  24  was detected at a   $30~\ensuremath{\upmu\mathrm{L}}/\ensuremath{\mathrm{min}}$   ﬂ ow rate over immobilized Keap1. The contact steps were run for   $300\,s$  , and the dissociation steps were run for   $400\ s$  . Solution correction of running buffer was performed to eliminate the in ﬂ uence of DMSO. The dissociation constants   $\left(\mathrm{{K}_{D}}\right)$   were calculated from the sensorgrams using the 1:1 binding kinetics model. The data were analyzed using Biacore  $8~\mathrm{K}$   Evaluation Software.  

# 2.6. Statistical analysis  

GraphPad Prism 8.0 software was applied for statistical analysis. The in vitro measurements were repeated three times. Experimental results in vivo were analyzed via a single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett's test. All results are presented as the means    $\pm$   standard deviations (SD).  $\mathrm{~P~}<\,0.05$   was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant.  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. Chemical  

The synthetic procedure of the target compounds is presented in  Scheme 1 . First, salicylic acid chloride was formed by the interaction of 4-tri ﬂ u oro methyl salicylic acid and thionyl chloride. Then, intermediates were obtained from condensation between salicylamide and 4-tri ﬂ uoromethyl-substituted salicylic acid. Afterward, the target compounds were synthesized by cyclization of the intermediate and substituent phenyl hydrazine. All starting materials were commercially available. The products were puri ﬁ ed by crystall iz ation or column chromatography, of which purity  $(>\!95\%)$   was determined by HPLC. The structures of the compounds were identi ﬁ ed by    $\phantom{+}^{1}\mathrm{H}$   NMR   $(500~\mathrm{MHz})$  ,  $^{13}\mathsf{C}$   NMR (  $126\ \mathrm{MHz})$  , and high resolution mass spectrum (HRMS).  

# 3.2. Screening of neuro protective effects and SAR analysis  

During the ischemia e reperfusion process of ischemic stroke, oxidative stress may cause neuronal dysfunction and death. PC12 cells have been widely investigated as a model to imitate neurological disease due to their similar characteristics to nerve cells [ 39 , 40 ]. Sodium nitro prussi de (SNP) was employed as a stimulant to induce apoptosis in PC12 cells, which simulated neuronal oxidative stress in ischemic stroke. Edaravone is a free radical  

![](images/a83b4fa33af4d4191f6193003471d36983afcbd16afee285499cb6e7d50a7ad8.jpg)

scavenger that possesses excellent anti oxidative effects and has therapeutic effects in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Therefore, it was selected as the positive control in the experiments.  

Fig. 3  shows that the viability of PC12 cells markedly decreased with increasing concentrations of SNP. Based on the above result, treatment with  $400~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP was selected for biological evaluation when the cell viability was approximately  $60\%$  . The neuro protective effects of the target compounds and the lead compound phenolic substituent oxadiazole were evaluated at concentrations of   $1~{\upmu\mathrm{M}}$  ,  $5~{\upmu\mathrm{M}},$  , and   $10~{\upmu\mathrm{M}}.$  . Edaravone was used as a positive control.  

Table 1  demonstrates that the target compounds alleviated SNPinduced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, which showed an enhancement of cyto protection against oxidative lesions. Most derivatives exhibited a signi ﬁ cant neuro protective effect at   $5~{\upmu\mathrm{M}}.$  , which was further investigated using SAR analysis. Speci ﬁ cally, when the derivatives were occupied with a single substituent at the 4-position (compounds  1 e 12 ), the alkyl groups (compounds  1 ,  2  and  3 ) possessed better protective effects than the other groups. Among them, compound  3  with isopropyl was the most active. However, excessive steric hindrance might result in low ef ﬁ cacy (compound  4) . When the halogens were introduced to the para-position, the biological effects were less active. These results indicated that alkyl groups might be bene ﬁ cial to biological effects.  

To further investigate the in ﬂ uence of the substituted position on the activity, compounds  13 e 20  were synthesized. Among the substituents at the 2-position (compounds  13 e 16 ), halogen atoms were favorable, and chlorine replacement (compound  14 ) was the most active. Additionally, substituents at the 3-position are more likely to have better neuro protective effects. Among these derivatives, -Cl (compound  18 ),  $\mathrm{-CF_{3}}$   (compound  19 ), and    $-0\mathsf{C}\mathsf{H}_{3}$  (compound  20 ) improved cell viability up to   $90\%$  . Substituent groups at the 3-position were found to show a greater cytoprotective effect than those at the 2-position or 4-position.  

Compounds  21 e 26  were occupied by a couple of substituents. When the occupations were at the 2,4-position, methyl substituents exhibited a better protective effect (compound  21 ). When the occupations were at the 3,5-position, methyl (compound  24 )

PC12 cells were pretreated with compounds for  $2\:\mathrm{h}$   and incubated with   $400\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for  $24\,\mathrm{h}$  . The lead compound was phenolic substituent oxadiazole. Edaravone was used as positive control. (Data are presented as the mean  $\pm\nobreakspace S\mathrm{D}$   of three replicates,  $***{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{p}}}<0.001$  ,  $^{**}\mathsf{p}<0.01$   and    $\mathrm{}^{*}\mathrm{}\mathrm{p}<0.05$   compared to SNP group).  

and  ﬂ uorine (compound  25 ) were preferable, and their protective effect approached   $100\%$  . Among the derivatives occupied by a couple of substituents, compounds  24  and  25 , with  $\mathrm{-}\mathsf{C}\mathsf{H}_{3}$   or    $-\mathrm{F}$   at positions 3 and 5, exhibited better activity than a single substituent.  

In summary, when substituted with a single group at the 4- position, compounds with alkyl groups were likely to exert better neuro protective effects, followed by those with halogens. Further investigation showed that substituents at the 3-position were preferable to those at positions 2 or 4. In addition, simultaneous occupation at positions 3 and 5 may be bene ﬁ cial to the protective effect against SNP-induced apoptosis.

# 3.3. Cyto toxicity assay  

The most active compounds were selected to evaluate cytotoxicity toward PC12 and HaCaT cells by the MTT method. The results are presented in  Table 2  as the half maximal inhibitory concentration   $\left(\mathsf{I C}_{50}\right)$  . In general, half of the derivatives exhibited weak toxicity to PC12 with  $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$   values of higher than  $100~\upmu\mathrm{M}.$  . Among them, compounds  21  and  24  showed the highest   $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$   values at 210.9 and   $261.3\ \upmu\mathrm{M},$  , respectively, which were far beyond their effective concentrations. At the same time, the   $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$   values of compound  24  toward HaCaT cells were higher than   $100~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  , indicating that it was safe for these cells.  

Taken together, compound  24  was selected for further biological studies because of its outstanding neuro protective effect and weak cyto toxicity.  

# 3.4. Evaluation of plasma protein binding rate and stability in plasma  

Most medicinal compounds can bind with plasma proteins and form complexes in plasma. The binding rate of plasma protein inﬂ uences the distribution, excretion, and metabolism of molecules.  

Table 2 Cyto toxicity of compounds on PC12 and HaCaT cells. 
![](images/2e6cc1cf53ec6d1479eded29cfd4d6980f761c5ff3ca259776ef18a80c5510ce.jpg)  

In this regard, compound  24  was investigated for the binding rate of plasma proteins. As shown in  Table 3 , compound  24  exhibited high protein binding rates in human   $(99.94\%)$   and rat   $(99.92\%)$   plasma, which was similar to keto co nazo le. The strong binding with plasma protein decreased the concentration of free compound in plasma, which might lead to the long duration and slow elimination of compound.  

Compound  24  was further evaluated for its metabolic stability in human plasma at a concentration of   $2~{\upmu}{\bf M}$  . The percentages of the remaining compounds were detected over time by LC e MS/MS. As shown in  Table 4 , prop an the line was rapidly degraded in   $^{\mathrm{~2~h~}}$   in human plasma, while the percentage of compound  24  remained at a high level after 2 h  $_1(88.90\%)$  . The results revealed that the half-life of compound  24  was longer than   $529.18\ \mathrm{min}$  , which was much greater than that of prop an the line. This result demonstrated that compound  24  possessed high stability in human plasma.  

In summary, compound  24  possessed a high protein binding rate and long half-life of degradation in plasma, which might contribute to its sustained therapeutic effect in vivo.  

# 3.5. Inhibition evaluation on hERG channel  

The hERG channel is a potassium ion channel that plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac re polarization. Blockage of the hERG channel can cause serious cardiac side effects, such as prolongation of the QT interval. For this reason, compound  24  was further assessed for inhibition of the hERG channel. Cisapride is a gastrointestinal ex ci to motor that has the effect of hERG channel inhibition. As shown in  Table 5 , cisapride showed obvious inhibition of the hERG channel   $(\mathsf{I C}_{50}=0.017~\upmu\mathsf{M})$  , while compound  24 showed moderate inhibition (IC  $(\mathsf{I C}_{50}>30~\upmu\mathsf{M})$  M). The results indicated that compound  24  was less likely to produce car dio toxicity.  

3.6. Preliminary assessment of the acute toxicity  

Before the in vivo assessment, compound  24  was evaluated for acute toxicity ( Table 6 ). Healthy   ${\tt B A L B}/{\tt c}$   mice were randomly divided into three groups with  ﬁ ve mice in each group. Their death status and behavior were observed after intra peritoneal administration of different doses of compounds. At dosages of   $175~\mathrm{mg/kg}$  and   $550\ \mathrm{mg/kg},$  , no obvious acute toxic symptoms were noted. However, the tested compound showed toxicity to the experimental mice at   $1000\;\mathrm{\:mg/kg}$  . The   $50\%$   lethal dose   $(\mathrm{LD}_{50})$   was calculated by the AOT425 statistical program. The results showed that the   $\mathrm{LD}_{50}$   of intra peritoneal injection with compound  24  was  $789\;\mathrm{mg/kg},$  , and the   $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval was   $550{-}1000\;\mathrm{mg/kg}.$  Compound  24  showed low toxicity and was further investigated for its p harm a co kinetic characteristics and therapeutic effects.

under the curve  $(\mathsf{A U C}_{0-\mathrm{inf}})$  was measured to calculate the bio availability (F). The results showed that the intra peritoneal and intravenous  ${\sf A U C}_{0-\mathrm{inf}}$  were   $2929.88\,\mathrm{{ng/ml^{*}h}}$   and   $10182.73\,\mathrm{ng}/\mathrm{mL}^{*}\mathrm{h}$  , respectively. Consequently, the bio availability of compound  24  was

  $28.87\%$  . Compound  24  remained in vivo with a long residence time

  $(16.46~\mathrm{h)}$  ) and half-life   $(12.75\mathrm{~h)}$  ) after intra peritoneal injection. In addition, the results showed that the systemic clearance of compound  24  was low. The p harm a co kinetic parameters indicated that compound  24  had the advantage of drug-likeness characteristics.  

# 3.8. Compound  24  improved neurological function of MCAO rats  

After  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   of operation, the neurological functions of rats were measured by Zea Longa's scoring method. As shown in  Fig. 4 , the neurological score markedly increased in the model group  $(2.22\pm0.44)$   compared with that of the control group   $(0.00\pm0.00)$  , indicating that cerebral ischemia e reperfusion injury induced neurological de ﬁ cits in rats. In contrast with the model group, treatment with compound  24  decreased neurological scores. In the low-dose group, compound  24  slightly improved the neurological functions of middle cerebral artery occlusion assay (MCAO) rats  $(1.87\pm0.64)\$  . In addition, treatment with medium and high doses of compound  24  signi ﬁ cantly attenuated the behavioral de ﬁ cits of MCAO rats (medium-dose:   $1.60\pm0.51$  , and high-dose:   $1.50\pm0.52)$  . The results indicated that administration of compound  24  might be bene ﬁ cial for maintaining consciousness in the rats.

The therapeutic effect of compound  24  on acute ischemic stroke was assessed via MCAO rats [ 41 ]. Edaravone was used as the

positive control to determine the anti-ischemic effect. The infarction volume was measured by TTC staining.  

As shown in  Fig. 5 A and B, compared with those of the control group, signi ﬁ cant enlargement of cerebral infarct sizes was observed in the model group   $(24.26~\pm~6.17\%)$  , indicating the establishment of cerebral ischemic injury. The results showed that the infarction volumes were reduced after treatment with compound  24  (low dose:   $16.37\pm6.51\%$  , medium dose:   $14.49\pm5.62\%$  , high dose:   $12.23\;\pm\;8.50\%$  , which was similar to the effect of edaravone (  $12.77\pm5.82\%$  ).  

In summary, treatment with compound  24  improved the physiological and neurological status of the tested rats by reducing cerebral infarct sizes. The above results demonstrated that compound  24  might have a potential neuro protective effect in the treatment of cerebral ischemic injury.  

# 3.10. Compound  24  improved the expression levels of serum biochemical indicators in vivo  

During the pathologic process of ischemic stroke, oxidative stress plays an important role in ischemia-reperfusion injury. To further investigate whether compound  24  could maintain redox balance in vivo, the levels of SOD and MDA in serum were evaluated. Compared with those of the control group, MCAO rats showed an obvious reduction in SOD and an increase in MDA, indicating an imbalance of the redox system ( Fig. 6 ). However, treatment with compound  24  signi ﬁ cantly increased SOD levels compared with the model group. Meanwhile, the serum levels of MDA decreased and approached those of the control group. These  ﬁ ndings demonstrated that compound  24  had the potential to restore redox balance in vivo, which is bene ﬁ cial for protection against ischemiareperfusion injury.

# 3.11. Compound  24  protected cells from SNP-induced apoptosis  

The following experiments were carried out to further investigate the mechanism of neuro protective effects. By direct microscopy observation ( Fig. 7 A e C), normal PC12 cells were fusiform shaped with long neurites. Treatment with SNP resulted in a decrease in cellular amount, and the cells became round without neurites. In the group pretreated with compound  24 , the PC12 cells were restored to normal quantity and morphology.  

Nuclear pyknosis is a vital characteristic of cellular apoptosis, and it can be detected by staining with Hoechst 33258 [ 42 ]. In Fig. 7 E, treatment with SNP signi ﬁ cantly enhanced blue  ﬂ uorescence and induced nuclear shrinkage compared with those of normal PC12 cells, indicating that SNP induced cellular apoptosis. Pre incubation with compound  24  decreased the  ﬂ uorescent signal and shrinkage of the nucleus ( Fig. 7 F), suggesting that compound 24  protected cells from SNP-mediated apoptosis.  

# 3.12. Compound  24  suppressed the accumulation of ROS  

Excessive generation of ROS can induce apoptosis of nerve cells [ 43 ]. To evaluate the anti oxidative effect of compound  24 , 2,7- di chlo rod i hydro ﬂ uorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to detect cellular ROS levels. Because DCFH-DA can be oxidized by ROS to generate green  ﬂ uorescence, the intensity of  ﬂ uorescence could re ﬂ ect the intracellular oxidative status. As shown in  Fig. 7 H, the ﬂ uorescence intensity signi ﬁ cantly increased after the cells were treated with SNP, indicating the accumulation of ROS. In contrast, the  ﬂ uorescent signal remained low in the group pretreated with compound  24  ( Fig. 7 I). The results indicated that treatment with  24 could inhibit the accumulation of ROS and protect cells from oxidative damage.  

# 3.13. Compound  24  restored mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)  

Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the contributing factors inducing neuronal apoptosis in ischemic stroke pathology [ 44 ]. The maintenance of MMP is essential for homeostasis and the physiological functional performance of mitochondria. In this work, MMP was detected by the voltage-sensitive  ﬂ uorescent probe   $5{,}5^{\prime}{,}6{,}6^{\prime}{.}$  - tetra chl oro $^{\cdot1,1^{\prime},3,3^{\prime}}$  -tetra ethyl benz imi daz ol yl carbo cyan in e iodide (JC-1) [ 45 ]. Under basal conditions, JC-1 is captured in the mitochondrial matrix to form aggregates and generate strong red ﬂ uorescence. In a stressed state, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a decrease in MMP. As a result, JC-1 is located in the cytoplasmic matrix as a monomer and generates green  ﬂ uorescence. As shown in  Fig. 8 , treatment with SNP signi ﬁ cantly reduced red  ﬂ uorescence while enhancing the green signal, indicating a decrease in MMP. In the group pretreated with compound  24 , a high intensity of red ﬂ uorescence and low intensity of green ﬂ uorescence were observed, indicating the restoration of MMP. According to these

results, compound  24  restored MMP to approximately normal levels under oxidative stress, which may contribute to the cytoprotective effect against oxidative injury.  

# 3.14. Compound  24  activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway  

Nrf2 is an indispensable element of the cellular redox system that regulates the expression of cyto protective proteins in response to oxidative stimulation. The levels of Nrf2 and Nrf2-dependent enzymes were determined by Western blotting. ML385, a speci ﬁ c inhibitor of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, was introduced to investigate the effect of compound  24  on activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. As shown in  Fig. 9 A, although a signi ﬁ cant change in total Nrf2 was not observed, the inhibition of Nrf2 expression by ML385 was reversed by treatment with compound  24 .  

The nuclear translocation of Nrf2 is the key step in initiating ARE genes and subsequently promoting the expression of anti oxidative enzymes in the Nrf2 signaling pathway. To further investigate whether compound  24  could promote the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, we extracted proteins from the nucleus and cytoplasm after pre treatment with compound  24 . As shown in  Fig. 9 C, compound 24  dose-dependent ly induced the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus compared with the control group. At the same time, the Nrf2 levels correspondingly decreased in the cytoplasm, indicating that compound  24  promoted the nuclear migration of Nrf2.  

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a crucial enzyme in the Nrf2 signaling pathway that degrades toxic free heme and provides protection against oxidative damage [ 46 ]. NAD(P)H quinone ox ido reductase 1 (NQO1) and GCLC are downstream proteins regulated by Nrf2 that also play important roles in the cellular anti oxidative response [ 47 ]. As shown in  Fig. 10 , the levels of cellular HO-1, NQO1, and GCLC increased after pre treatment with different concentrations of compound  24 . The results indicated that compound 24 promoted the expression of Nrf2-dependent proteins.  

Taken together, these data show that compound  24  up regulated the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which facilitated the expression of downstream anti oxidative proteins. The potency of activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway might contribute to the neuro protective effect against oxidative stress.

and Nrf2 has been demonstrated to be an important mechanism of activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway [ 12 ]. In this regard, SPR experiments were carried out to investigate whether compound  24 had the ability to interact with Keap1 by measuring the af ﬁ nity parameter.

LDEETGEF-OH) was used as a positive control. As shown in  Fig. 11 , the FITC-Nrf2 peptide bound with the Keap1 Kelch domain and reached the saturation level at 40 RU. The curve was  ﬁ tted to a 1:1 kinetic interaction model, and the results showed that the  $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{D}}$   value was  $2.05\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$  .  Fig. 11 C shows a combination between compound  24 and Keap1, but the response of the steady state was lower than that of the positive control. It exhibited a fast association and dissociation between compound  24  and Keap1. Calculation of the af ﬁ nity parameter revealed that the determined  $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{D}}$   value of compound  24 was  $22.70\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$  . The SPR assay demonstrated direct binding between the Keap1 Kelch domain and compound  24 , which might lead to activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in cells.  

# 4. Conclusion  

In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of 1,3,5- triaryl substituent triazole derivatives based on the structure of the phenolic substituent oxadiazole and edaravone. In vitro evaluation revealed that these compounds exhibited better neuroprotective effects than lead compounds. The SAR analysis demonstrated that alkyl groups were bene ﬁ cial to the protective effect. Among the derivatives, compound  24  exhibited superior protective effects and weak cyto toxicity and was chosen for further evaluation.  

Further investigation of drug-like properties revealed that compound  24  has a high plasma binding rate, long half-life, low hERG inhibition, moderate acute toxicity, and suitable pharmacokinetic properties. Treatment with compound  24  ameliorated the infarct size and neurological de ﬁ cits of MCAO rats. In addition, compound  24  alleviated oxidative stress in vivo by increasing the level of SOD and reducing the production of MDA.  

Treatment with compound  24  suppressed the accumulation of intracellular ROS and restored the de polarization of the MMP. Further investigation indicated that compound  24  could promote the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Additionally, compound  24 up regulated the expression levels of Nrf2-dependent anti oxidative enzymes, including HO-1, NQO1 and GCLC. Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that compound  24  could bind with the  $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{D}}$   value was   $22.70~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  .  

In summary, compound  24  could be a potential neuro protect ant for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
