Keywords:  ischemic stroke  genetic susceptibility  oxidative stress  gamma-glutamyl transfer as e (GGT1)  single nucleotide polymorphism  cigarette smoking  alcohol consumption  gene – environ-ment interactions  

Objectives:  Increased plasma gamma-glutamyl transfer as e (GGT1) has been identified as a robust and indepen­ dent risk factor for ischemic stroke (IS), but the molecular mechanisms of the enzyme-disease association are  unclear. The present study investigated whether polymorphisms in the GGT1 gene contribute to IS susceptibility.  Materials and Methods:  DNA samples obtained from 1288 unrelated individuals (600 IS patients and 688 controls)  were genotyped for common single nucleotide polymorphisms of GGT1 using the MassArray-4 platform.  Results:  The rs5751909 polymorphism was significantly associated with decreased risk of ischemic stroke  regardless sex and age   $(\mathrm{{P_{perm}}}~\leq~0.01$  , dominant genetic model). The haplotype rs4820599A-rs5760489A-rs5751909A showed strong protection against ischemic stroke (OR 0.53,   $95~\%\mathrm{CI}~0.36~{\cdot}~0.77$  ,   $\mathtt{P}_{\mathtt{P e r m}}\leq0.0001)$  ).  The protective effect of SNP rs5751909 in the stroke phenotype was successfully replicated in the UK Biobank,  SiGN, and ISGC cohorts   $(\mathbf{P}\leq0.01)$  . GGT1 polymorphisms showed joint (epistatic) effects on the risk of ischemic  stroke, with some known IS-associated GWAS loci (e.g., rs4322086 and rs12646447) investigated in our pop­ ulation. In addition, SNP rs5751909 was found to be strongly associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke  in non-smokers (O  $\mathrm{~R~}0.54\:95\:\%\mathrm{CI}\:0.39{\cdot}0.75,$  ,  $\mathrm{P_{perm}}=0.0002)$   and non-alcohol abusers (  $\mathrm{OR}\,0.43\,95\,\%\mathrm{CI}\,0.30{-}0.61$  ,   $\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{perm}}=2.0\times10^{-6})$  , whereas no protective effects of this SNP against disease risk were observed in smokers and  alcohol abusers   $(\mathrm{P_{perm}}<0.05)$  .  Conclusions:  We propose mechanisms underlying the observed associations between GGT1 polymorphisms and  ischemic stroke risk. This pilot study is the first to demonstrate that GGT1 is a novel susceptibility gene for  ischemic stroke and provides additional evidence of the genetic contribution to impaired redox homeostasis  underlying disease pathogen es is.  

stroke is the most common stroke type caused by a thrombotic or  embolic event that causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain, leading  to hypoxia and necrosis of the brain tissue. , Increased death rates and  long-term disability due to ischemic stroke in recent decades, especially  

# Introduction  

According to the Global Stroke Factsheet 2022, the lifetime risk of  developing stroke has increased by   $50~\%$   in the last 17 years. Ischemic  

in the working-age population, require the improvement of existing  methods for early diagnosis and treatment of patients with cerebrovas­ cular disease and the implementation of effective primary prevention  strategies focusing on the individual assessment of genetic and envi­ ronmental risk factors.  

Ischemic stroke is a multi factorial disease determined by complex  interactions between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. , Despite substantial progress in human genomics and other omics tech­ nologies in recent decades, the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pathogen es is of ischemic stroke are not fully understood. A growing  body of evidence has been accumulated indicating that oxidative stress  is a key pathological disorder underlying the multistep pathogen es is of  cerebro vascular disease. – 11  Oxidative stress is a universal process of  tissue damage caused by free radicals and other chemicals with high  oxidative potential.  

Glut at hi one is the most abundant non-protein thiol which plays  crucial roles in the protection of cells from oxidative stress. , Brain  cells are no exception. Maintaining the required glut at hi one content in  the brain at a level sufficient to ensure its function, maintain redox  homeostasis, and protect neuronal, glial, and endo the li al cells against  oxidative stress depends strongly on the availability of amino acid pre­ cursors for glut at hi one. , Despite the intensive consumption of oxy­ gen by the brain (approximately   $20\ \%$   of the oxygen utilized by the  body), the activity of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of  glut at hi one is lower than that in other organs. , The activity of these  enzymes is mostly determined by the presence of functionally important  polymorphisms in their genes, which can diminish enzyme activity or  expression, and lower glut at hi one levels in cells, making them more  susceptible to oxidative damage. Our previous studies have shown that  polymorphisms of genes involved in glut at hi one biosynthesis, such as  glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit ( GCLC ), glutamate-cysteine  ligase modifier subunit ( GCLM ), glut at hi one synthase ( GSS ), and  gamma-glut amyl cy clo transfer as e ( GGCT ), are associated with suscepti­ bility to ischemic stroke and impact brain infarct size. – 21  

Similar to many other organs, the brain consumes amino acid pre­ cursors of glut at hi one, which are transported through the bloodstream  from the liver, an organ that synthesizes a significant proportion of the  body ’ s glut at hi one. , Gamma-glutamyl transfer as e (GGT) is a  membrane-associated enzyme cleaving the gamma-glutamyl bond of  extracellular  glut at hi one,  glut at hi one  conjugates  and  other  gamma-glutamyl compounds with formation of L-c ystein yl glycine and  L-glutamate, thus supplying the cell with amino acids for glut at hi one  biosynthesis. , Notably, GGT is highly expressed in the blood-brain  barrier micro vessels, where it may participate in the transfer of amino  acids across the blood-brain barrier. , Interestingly, numerous stud­ ies 28 – 32  have shown that increased serum GGT levels are associated with  ischemic stroke susceptibility as an independent risk factor. However,  the cause of elevated plasma GGT levels in ischemic stroke remains  unclear. Given the putative pathogenic role of GGT in the development  of ischemic stroke, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in this gene  might contribute to disease susceptibility. However, polymorphisms in  the gene encoding gamma-glutamyl transfer as e (GGT1) have yet to be  studied with regard to their association with the risk of ischemic stroke.  Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to (i) investigate the link  between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  GGT1  gene and the risk of ischemic stroke; (ii) evaluate the joint effects of  GGT1  polymorphisms and environmental risk factors on disease sus­ ce pti bil it y; and (iii) investigate whether  GGT1  polymorphisms interact  epi statically with known ischemic stroke susceptibility genes discovered  by genome-wide association studies.  

# Methods  

Study patients  

Before participating in this study, each patient provided written  informed consent, and the Ethical Review Committee of Kursk State  Medical University approved the study protocol ( N ◦ 6, date of approval:  May 14, 2018). A total of 1288 unrelated subjects of Slavic origin were  recruited for the study, as described previously. , The study involved  600 patients with ischemic stroke, including 330 males and 270 females  (mean age:   $61.09\,\pm\,9.77$   years) who were hospitalized in the Neuro­ logical Division of the Regional Vascular Center, a part of the Kursk  Regional Clinical Hospital. Clinical examination, CT, and/or magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were performed to confirm the  diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Stroke patients with a positive history of  cardiac arrhythmia s were not included in the case group. Data on stroke  subtypes such as large artery disease, small vessel disease, and car­ dioembolic stroke were not available for study patients. The control  group, which included 688 healthy subjects without any chronic disease  (366 males and 322 females; mean age:   $60.84\;\pm\;7.45$   years), was  recruited in our previous studies, as previously described. , A vali­ dated brief screener 36  was used to answer questions about dietary intake  of fresh fruits and vegetables, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and  physical activity. Baseline, clinical, and laboratory characteristics as  well as data on environmental risk factors of the study patients were  described in our previous paper. Plasma concentrations of reactive  oxygen species were significantly higher in patients with IS than in  healthy controls, whereas plasma levels of oxidized glut at hi one were  significantly lower in the case group than in the control group.  

# Genetic analysis  

Total DNA was extracted from the patient ’ s whole blood samples of  study patients using a two-step procedure of phenol and chloroform  extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The selection of  GGT1  gene  polymorphisms was performed using the Candidate Gene SNP Selection  (GenePipe) tool available online at the SNPinfo Web Server ( https://sn  pinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/selegene.html ). Four common functional  SNPs of the  GGT1  gene, rs4820599, rs5760492, rs5751909, and  rs5760489, were selected for the study according to the following  criteria: tagSNP   $\mathbf{r}^{2}\,\geq\,0.8$  , minor allele frequency (MAF)   $>5~\%$  , and  presence of an eQTL associated with  GGT1  gene expression in the whole  blood (eQTLGen Consortium,  https://www.eqtlgen.org/phase1.html ).  Genotyping was performed using iPLEX technology on the MassARRAY  4 system (Agena Bioscience, USA). The MassARRAY Assay Design Suite  ( https://agenacx.com ) was used to select a primer set and design a  multiplex panel for SNP genotyping. Primer sequences are available  upon request. Five percent of the DNA samples were genotyped in  duplicate without knowledge of the case-control status to guarantee  quality control. More than  $99\,\%$   of the data were found to be concordant.  DNA analysis was performed at the Research Institute for Genetic and  Molecular Epidemiology of the Kursk State Medical University (Kursk,  Russia).  

# Statistical analysis  

Statistical power estimation using the GAS power calculator ( https://  csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/gas power calculator/ ) showed that we  could detect a genotype relative risk (GRR) of 1.25 – 1.40 with   $83–99\;\%$  power in the overall analysis and a GRR of 1.40 – 1.5 with  $72–83\,\%$   power  in the analysis of groups stratified by sex or risk factors at   $\upalpha=0.05$  .  Statistical analyses were performed using PLINK v1.9 software. Allele  and genotype frequencies in cases and controls were counted and  compared using the chi-square test with the values predicted by the  assumption of Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Fisher ’ s exact test  was used to assess the distribution of genotype frequencies in accor­ dance with HWE. Odds ratios (OR) and  $95\,\%$   confidence intervals (  $.95\,\%$  CI) were used to assess the association between  GGT1  alleles and ge­ notypes and ischemic stroke risk. Allelic, recessive, dominant, and  log-additive genetic models were used for association analysis between  SNPs and ischemic stroke risk. Gene-environment interactions were  analyzed in groups stratified by risk factors, such as cigarette smoking,  alcohol abuse, hypo dyna mia, and dietary deficiency of fresh fruits  and/or vegetables. The  $\mathtt{p}$  -values   $\mathrm{(P_{perm})}$   for allele, genotype and haplo­ type associations with disease risk were estimated using adaptive per­ mutations using PLINK and Haploview. Replication analysis of  SNP-disease associations observed in our population was performed in  independent cohorts whose genomic data were deposited in the UK  Biobank (http://geneatlas.roslin.ed.ac.uk) and the Cerebro vascular  Disease Knowledge Portal ( https://cd.hugeamp.org ). The contribution  of  epistatic  interactions  between  GGT1  polymorphisms  and  genome-wide associated loci for ischemic stroke to disease susceptibility  was evaluated using a diplotype association analysis. We selected seven  IS-associated GWAS loci, including rs2417957 ( SLCO1B1 ), rs6511720  ( LDLR ), rs4322086 ( RASEF ), rs12449964 ( PEMT ), rs12646447 ( PITX2 ),  rs899997 (LOC105370913), rs11556924 ( ZC3HC1 ), and rs783396  ( AIM1 ), which have been previously investigated as disease suscepti­ bility markers in our population. The chi-square test was used to  determine diplotype associations with the risk of ischemic stroke, and  the false discovery rate (FDR) approach was used to adjust for multiple  comparisons (False Discovery Rate Online Calculator,  https://tools.  carbocation.com/FDR ).  

# Results  

Genotype frequencies for the  GGT1  gene polymorphisms were in  accordance with the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium in both cases and  controls, except for SNP rs5760492, which showed a significant devia­ tion from HWE in all study groups   $(\mathsf{P}<0.0001)$  ). Therefore, this poly­ morphism was excluded from further statistical analysis.  Table 1  shows  a summary of associations between polymorphisms of the  GGT1  gene  and the risk of ischemic stroke in the entire and sex-stratified groups. We  found that variant allele and genotypes of SNP rs5751909 were signif­ icantly   $(\mathrm{P_{perm}}\leq0.01)$   associated with decreased risk of ischemic stroke  in both males and females (dominant genetic model). None of the other  investigated  GGT1  polymorphisms showed an association with ischemic  stroke in the entire and sex-stratified groups. No significant association  between the studied SNPs and brain infarct size in patients with IS was  observed (data not shown).  

We performed a replication analysis of the rs5751909-disease asso­ ciation in independent cohorts from the UK Biobank ( http://geneatlas.  roslin.ed.ac.uk ) and the Cerebro vascular Disease Knowledge Portal  ( https://cd.hugeamp.org ). We found that the allele rs5751909A of  GGT1  is also associated with a decreased risk of stroke (UK biobank ’ s  phenotype ID: I64 Stroke, not specified as hemorrhage or infarction: OR   $=0.88$  ,  ${\tt P}=0.005$  ) and large artery atherosclerosis (the Cerebro vascular  Disease Knowledge Portal ’ s phenotype: CCS phenotypic crypto geni c  large artery atherosclerosis major:  $\mathrm{OR}=0.10$  ,  $\mathbf{P}=0.004$  ).  

We evaluated the joint effects of  GGT1  polymorphisms on the risk of  ischemic stroke via haplotype and diplotype analyses.  Table 2  shows the  GGT1  haplotypes and their association with IS risk in the overall and  sex-stratified groups. Four common haplotypes of  GGT1  with a fre­ quency of   $>\,5\ \%$   were identified among the study subjects. The  H3  haplotype (AAA) was associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke  in both sexes   $(\mathrm{P_{perm}}\,\leq\,0.04)$  . Moreover, haplotype  H5  (AGG) with a  frequency of approximately   $3~\%$   was associated with increased disease  risk in males   $(\mathrm{P_{perm}}=0.046)$  , but not in females   $(\mathrm{P_{perm}}=0.52)$  . We also  aimed to identify whether epistatic interactions between  GGT1  poly­ morphisms and the seven genome-wide associated loci for   $I{\cal S}^{\mathrm{9}}$    jointly  contribute to disease risk. To maintain high statistical power for the  diplotype-IS association, the analysis was performed only on the entire  group of study patients. The diplotype associations with the risk of  ischemic stroke are shown in  Table 3 . Nineteen diplotypes were found to  be significantly associated with the risk of ischemic stroke at   $\mathrm{FDR}\leq$  0.05. Notably, the majority of diplotype associations with IS risk  comprised  GGT1  genotypes with disease-associated GWAS loci, partic­ ularly rs4322086 ( RASEF ).

As ischemic stroke is a complex multi factorial disorder, it is critical  to explore the combined impact of environmental risk factors and  GGT1  gene polymorphisms on disease development. Risk factors, such as di­ etary deficiency of fresh fruits and/or vegetables, cigarette smoking,  alcohol abuse, and hypo dyna mia, were used for gene-environment  interaction analysis in IS susceptibility.  Table 4  summarizes the associ­ ations between  GGT1  polymorphisms and IS risk in groups stratified by  cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, hypo dyna mia, and dietary deficiency  of fresh fruits and/or vegetables. SNP rs5751909 was found to be  strongly associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke in non-smokers   $(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{perm}}=0.0002)$   and in those who were not alcohol abusers   $(\mathrm{P_{perm}}=2.0\times10^{-6})$  , whereas no protective effects of this SNP against  disease risk was observed in smokers   $(\mathrm{P_{perm}}=0.44)$   and alcohol abusers   $(\mathrm{P_{perm}}=0.75)$  . In addition, the protective effects of the polymorphism  on IS risk were observed in participants who did not depend on their  physical activity or dietary intake of fresh fruits and/or vegetables.  

# Discussion  

GGT1  gene polymorphisms have never been studied in terms of their  association with the risk of ischemic stroke. The present study identified  for the first time gamma-glut amyl transfer as e 1 as a novel susceptibility  gene whose polymorphism rs5751909 contributes to the risk of ischemic  stroke. In particular, allele rs5751909A, genotypes rs5751909A/A-A/G,  and haplotype rs4820599A-rs5760489A-rs5751909A of  GGT1  were  found to be associated with decreased disease risk. A replication asso­ ciation analysis performed in independent cohorts confirmed the pro­ tective effect of the rs5751909 polymorphism of  GGT1  against the risk of  stroke and large artery atherosclerosis. Since ischemic stroke is a  multi factorial disease in which both genetic and environmental factors  play a role, it would also be reasonable to investigate the joint effects of  gene polymorphisms and environmental risk factors on disease suscep­ tibility. Gene-environment interaction analysis showed that the pro­ tective effect of this polymorphism against ischemic stroke was not  observed in cigarette smokers or alcohol abusers. We also found that  SNPs of the  GGT1  gene tightly interact with known ischemic stroke-associated loci such as rs4322086 ( RASEF ), rs2417957 ( SLCO1B1 ),  rs6511720 ( LDLR ), rs12646447 ( PITX2 ), rs11556924 ( ZC3HC1 ),  rs783396C ( AIM1 ), and rs899997 (LOC105370913), and jointly  contribute to the disease risk. These findings suggest that the  GGT1  gene  is a part of the polygenic predisposition to ischemic stroke, which is at  least realized through impaired redox homeostasis and associated  oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is known to contribute to multistep

mechanisms underlying the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke, including  cerebral artery atherosclerosis, , at hero sclerotic plaque formation  and rupture, cerebral artery thrombosis, and oxidative damage of  the ischemic brain.  

We observed five of the nineteen diplotype associations with IS risk  that were interactions between polymorphisms of  GGT1  (rs5751909 and  rs5760489) and SNP rs4322086 located in an intergenic region close to  the  RASEF  and  FRMD3  genes. This polymorphism was discovered by the  International Stroke Genetics Consortium as a locus associated with the  risk of ischemic stroke 43  and further successfully replicated in the  Russian population. According to the QTLbase2 database, the  rs4322086-G allele is associated (FDR   $<~0.0001]$  ) with increased  expression of the FRMD3 gene in   $\mathrm{CD14+}$   blood monocytes. The  FRMD3 gene encodes a cytoskeletal protein that is part of the protein 4.1  family (namely FERM domain containing 3), involved in maintaining  cell shape and integrity, but an exact role of this protein has not yet  been elucidated. Monocytes are recognized to play an important role  in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis, as well as in plaque  de stabilization, by producing signals that increase inflammation and  neo ang io genesis. In particular,   $\mathrm{CD14+}$   monocytes specialize in the  production of reactive oxygen species and the secretion of inflammatory  cytokines, thereby promoting vascular inflammation and atheroscle­ rosis. Thus, it could be suggested that associations of the diplotypes,  comprising genotypes rs5760489A/G or rs5751909G/G of  GGT1  and  the rs4322086G/A genotype, with an increased risk of ischemic stroke  can be explained by interactions between the genes at the metabolic  level in   $\mathrm{CD14+}$   monocytes, namely by the regulation of the cellular  redox state through the levels of ROS and glut at hi one and associated  inflammation. Additional studies are needed before definitive conclu­ sions can be drawn to explain the identified gene -gene interactions.  

The path o physiological interpretation of the observed associations  between the rs5751909 polymorphism of  GGT1  and ischemic stroke risk  is of great interest. This SNP has not been previously investigated for its  association with any disease, whereas another SNP of  GGT1 , rs4820599,  we investigated, has been found to be associated with liver enzyme  levels, including gamma glutamyl trans pep tid as e, , as well as with  blood cell counts, and other traits. A recent GWAS identified that the  rs5751909A allele is associated with increased urinary metabolite levels  in patients with chronic kidney disease. We performed functional  annotation of the rs5751909 polymorphism using various bio in format­ ics Internet resources. According to data from the eQTLGen Consortium  ( https://www.eqtlgen.org/phase1.html ), the rs5751909A allele is  associated with decreased expression of  GGT1, LRRC75B / FAM211B,  BCRP3, SGSM1  and genes in whole blood (  $\mathrm{FDR}<0.0001$  ). LRRC75B 

 (leucine-rich repeat containing 75 B) has an unknown function. BCRP3 

 (BCR pseudogene 3) is a long noncoding RNA that has been recently  identified as an activator of VPS34 and autophagy, thereby promoting  protein homeostasis and cell survival. SGSM1 is a small G protein  signaling modulator 1enabling GTPase activator and small GTPase  binding activities and has also been predicted to be involved in intra­ cellular protein transport (Entrez Gene ID: 129049). According to the  SEdb 2.0 resource, a comprehensive Super-Enhancer database of human  and mouse ( https://bio.liclab.net/sedb , accessed by 25.08.2023), the  rs5751909 polymorphism is a part of super-enhancers in the peripheral  blood (IDs: SE_02_104300518 and SE_02_104800923). The term  super-enhancer refers to groupings of putative enhancers that are  located in close genomic proximity and have extremely high levels of  transcription factor-binding. GGT1, LRRC75B, BCRP3  and  SGSM1  genes are located in the same genomic region 22q11.23, and their  expression appears to be regulated in a coordinated manner by common  transcription factors. In particular, as can be seen from the SEdb 2.0  resource, the above super-enhancers, associated with the rs5751909  polymorphism, are involved in the coordinated regulation of gene  expression in peripheral blood cells by multiple transcription factors.  

According to the data of the GTEx portal ( https://gtexportal.org  /home/  accessed by 25.08.2023), allele rs5751909A is associated  with decreased expression of  GGT1  in the whole blood and its increased  expression in multiple tissues and organs of the gastrointestinal tract  (pancreas, colon, small intestine, stomach, esophagus and lesser extent  in the liver) as well as in thyroid tissue and testis. Thus, it can be  concluded that the rs5751909A allele is associated with increased  expression of GGT in the cell membranes of peripheral tissues, and that  extracellular glut at hi one is cat a boli zed by enzymes into L-cys­ te in yl glycine and L-glutamate, which are transported inside the cell for  de novo  synthesis of glut at hi one. In contrast, the rs5751909G allele is  associated with increased IS risk in our study and increased plasma  levels of GGT, an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke. – 32  Apparently, the rs5751909G allele reduces the activity or expression of

GGT1 in tissues, resulting in a decrease in the catabolism of extracellular  glut at hi one, and consequently, a decrease in the supply of its amino acid  precursors into the cell. The resulting deficiency of glut at hi one in cells,  primarily in the liver, the main organ that provides all cells of the body  with glut at hi one, , contributes to the activation of hepatic expression  of GGT1, resulting in a significant increase in its concentration in blood  plasma. It is known that this condition is associated with an increased  risk of ischemic stroke as well as other diseases accompanied by intra­ cellular glut at hi one deficiency, such as liver disease, cardiovascular  disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. , We have  recently hypothesized that increased production of hepatic enzymes,  including gamma-glut amyl transfer as e, may represent an adaptive re­ action of the host in response to intracellular glut at hi one deficiency. , In other words, this process indicates metabolic reprogramming aimed  at mobilizing the amino acids of glut at hi one precursors (cysteine,  glycine and glutamate) by hydro ly zing proteins and peptides through  protease (GGT1, GGT7, gamma glutamyl trans pep tid as es types 1 and 7)  and peptidase (ANPEP, membrane alanyl amino pep tid as e) reactions and  their subsequent uptake and transport into cells for de novo synthesis of  glut at hi one.  

Gene-environment interactions that we identified also confirm the  above hypothesis. The rs5751909A allele showed a protective effect  against the risk of ischemic stroke in subjects who were non-smokers and  non-alcohol abusers (Table 5). Cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse,  well-known risk factors of ischemic stroke in both men and women, – 65  are the factors responsible for the depletion of endogenous glut at hi one  pool. – 69  The protective effect of the allele is apparently due to the fact  that in individuals who are not affected by glut at hi one-depleting factors,  glut at hi one synthesis is provided by GGT at a level sufficient to maintain  redox homeostasis and protect against oxidative stress. Thus, summa­ rizing data discussed above, it can be concluded that the association of  GGT1  polymorphisms with the risk of ischemic stroke is most reasonably  explained by the involvement of this enzyme in the catabolism of  extracellular glut at hi one and its de novo synthesis under conditions of  oxidative stress, one of the leading pathological processes underlying  

# the development of atherosclerosis. ,  

The present study has some limitations. Although we studied almost  all tagSNPs of  GGT1  (with the exception of rs5751902), some func­ tionally significant polymorphisms that are weakly or unlinked to the  studied tagSNPs can also have an independent effect on the risk of  ischemic stroke. Therefore, further genetic studies with a wider spec­ trum of functional polymorphisms are warranted to substantiate the role  of GGT1 in the molecular pathogen es is of ischemic stroke. Further  studies are required to investigate the association between  GGT1  poly­ morphisms and stroke subtypes, such as large artery disease, small vessel  disease, and card i oem boli c stroke. Since the studied polymorphisms of  the  GGT1  gene are located in noncoding regions and their phenotypic  effects in the cerebral arteries and brain have not been investigated,  interpretation of the observed genotype-phenotype associations should  be done with caution. Another limitation is that since GGT concentra­ tions were not measured in the patients ’  plasma, it was not possible to  investigate the association of polymorphisms with enzyme levels and  thus demonstrate a genotype-phenotype relationship. Finally, because  the present study was performed and replicated in patients of European  ancestry, the association between  GGT1  polymorphisms and the risk of  ischemic stroke should be validated in other ethnic groups.  

In conclusion, this pilot study is the first to demonstrate that GGT1 is  a novel susceptibility gene for ischemic stroke and that polymorphisms  in this gene may contribute to an elevated gamma-glutamyl transfer as e  level, which has recently been confirmed as a causal factor for disease  risk. This study provided additional evidence of the contribution of  genetic factors, namely  GGT1  gene polymorphism, to impaired redox  homeostasis and associated oxidative stress in ischemic stroke. Known  risk factors for ischemic stroke, such as smoking and alcohol abuse, have  been found to be important disease risk modifiers in subjects with the  rs5751909A allele of  GGT1 , and their effects are attributed to the  depletion of intracellular glut at hi one. The present study also sheds light  on the molecular mechanisms underlying increased plasma levels of  gamma-glut amyl transfer as e as an independent risk factor for ischemic  stroke. Further investigation of the genetic contribution to impaired  redox homeostasis, particularly to glut at hi one metabolism, in conjunc­ tion with environmental risk factors will uncover key molecular mech­ anisms of the disease and offer new means for the treatment and  prevention of cerebro vascular disorders and their outcomes.
