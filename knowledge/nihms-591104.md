# Abstract  

Background and Purpose— Elevated homo cyst eine (tHcy) levels are known to be associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (IS). Given that both tHcy and IS are heritable traits, we investigated a potential genetic relationship between homo cyst eine levels and stroke risk by assessing 18 polymorphisms previously associated with tHcy levels for their association with IS and its subtypes.  

Methods— Previous meta-analysis results from an international stroke collaborative network, METASTROKE, were utilized to assess association of the 18 tHcy associated SNPs in 12,389 IS cases and 62,004 controls. We also investigated the associations in regions located within 50kb from the 18 tHcy related SNPs, and the association of a genetic risk score including the 18 SNPs.  

Results— One SNP located in the  RASIP1  gene and a cluster of three SNPs located at and near SLC17A3  were significantly associated with IS   $_{(\mathrm{P}<0.0003)}$   after correcting for multiple testing. For stroke subtypes, the sentinel SNP located upstream of  MUT  was significantly associated with SVD (small vessel disease)   $(\mathrm{P=}0.0022)$  ), while one SNP located in  MTHFR  was significantly associated with LVD (large vessel disease)   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.00019}$  ). A genetic risk score including the 18 SNPs did not show significant association with IS or its subtypes.  

Conclusions— This study found several potential associations with IS and its subtypes: an association of an  MUT  variant with SVD, an  MTHFR  variant with LVD, and associations of RASIP1  and  SLC17A3  variants with overall IS.

# Introduction  

The relationship between plasma homo cyst eine (tHcy) levels and stroke risk has been investigated by numerous observational studies, which together provide compelling evidence that elevated homo cyst eine levels are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (IS).  However, residual confounding and reverse causation impair causal inference from the results of observational studies.  Mendelian random iz ation studies investigating a potential causal relationship between tHcy and IS risk have yielded inconclusive results.  

Recent studies showed that lowering homo cyst eine levels through vitamin B (folic acid and vitamin B12) intervention reduced the risk of stroke in patients with normal renal function and with normal vitamin B12 metabolism.  These findings may explain the negative results obtained by earlier studies  where renal function and vitamin B12 metabolism status were not taken into account. In addition, the folic acid fortification of grains in the US and some European countries may have also reduced the benefit of folic acid intervention trials.  Thus, the relationship between stroke and homo cyst eine is complex and careful consideration is required in designing future clinical trials.  

Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of plasma homo cyst eine levels in 44,147 individuals of European ancestry identified 13 associated genetic loci at genome-wide significance   $(\mathrm{P}{<}5{\times}10^{-8})$  ).  Within the 13 associated loci, this meta-analysis identified 18 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explaining  $6\%$   of variation in tHcy levels.  

Since both tHcy and IS have a genetic component, the reported association between tHcy and stroke risk may result from shared genetic risk factors. Thus, we investigated the 18 SNPs previously associated with homo cyst eine levels for their association with IS and its subtypes: large-vessel (LVD), small-vessel (SVD) and card i oem boli c (CE) stroke. We also evaluated association of a genotype risk score (GRS) including the18 tHcy-associated SNPs for association with IS and its subtypes.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Study Population  

The study population included 12,389 IS cases and 62,004 controls of European ancestry from 15 cohorts contributing to the METASTROKE collaboration 12 . Details of the study designs for each participating study are included in the Online Supplement (Please see  http:// stroke.aha journals.org ).  

# SNP selection  

Plasma homo cyst eine associated SNPs reaching genome-wide significance   $(\mathrm{P}{<}5{\times}10^{-8})$   in a published meta-analysis of GWAS 11  were selected for inclusion. In total, 18 independent SNPs   $(\mathrm{r}^{2}{<}0.2)$   were found to be significantly associated with tHcy at a  $\mathrm{P}{<}5{\times}10^{-8}$   and selected for assessment in and its subtypes (Supplementary Table I). As a secondary analysis, to account for potential population differences in linkage d is equilibrium (LD) between functional and tag-SNPs, we included additional SNPs located  $\pm\,50\mathrm{k}\mathsf{b}$   around the 18 tHcy associated SNPs, and a total of 3160 SNPs were selected out of which 166 variants were independent   $(\mathrm{r}^{2}{<}0.2)$  .  

# Statistical analysis  

Summary statistics for association of the 18 tHcy associated SNPs with IS and its subtypes were provided by METASTROKE consortium. Details on genotyping, imputation and quality control methods are provided in Supplemental Methods. Logistic regression was performed to test association of individual SNPs with IS and its subtypes assuming an additive model, and adjusting for study-specific covariates age, sex and ancestry principal components (Supplemental Methods).  

Considering that stroke subtypes are independent of each other , we pre-specified a Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold of  $\mathrm{a}{=}0.0027$   (where  $\mathrm{a}{=}0.05/18$   SNPs) to adjust for primary analyses testing 18 independent SNPs for association with IS and its subtypes.  

For the secondary analysis of SNPs located within  $\pm50\mathrm{k}\mathsf{b}$   of the 18 tHcy related SNPs we specified a Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold of 0.0003   $\mathrm{(a=0.05/166=0.0003}$  , for 166 independent SNPs tested).  

We then tested the association between an additive genotype risk score (GRS) of the 18 homo cyst eine associated SNPs and increased risk of IS and its subtypes. The GRS was calculated using a previously described method 17  (Supplemental Methods).  

Using the CATS genetic power calculator 18 , our study had  $80\%$   power to detect odds ratios (OR) of 1.06–1.11 for IS, and subtype-specific OR of 1.13–1.23 for variants with allele frequency  $10–50\%$   at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 0.0027   $\mathrm{\check{a}=}0.05/18$  ).  

# Results  

# Study population characteristics  

The discovery meta-analysis of IS studies included 12,389 cases and 62,004 controls of European descent. Stroke subtypes CE, LVD and SVD accounted for  $19\%$     $\mathbf{\tilde{n}}{=}2{,}365$  ),   $17.4\%$   $\mathbf{\check{n}}{=}2{,}167)$  ) and   $15.2\%$     $\mathbf{\tilde{n}}{=}1,894$  ) respectively, of all IS cases. Detailed characteristics of the participating studies have been summarised previously.  

# Association of tHcy associated SNPs with Overall IS  

Firstly, we assessed the association of each tHcy associated SNP with IS risk, and subsequently with its subtypes. Then, we tested the combined effect of the 18 sentinel tHcy associated SNPs on risk of IS and its subtypes.  

For overall IS, the OR for the 18 tested SNPs ranged from 0.96–1.04 (Supplementary Table II). Of the 18 SNPs tested, two SNPs located at/near  FUT1  (rs838133, OR 1.04;  $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  1.00– 1.07;  ${\it P}{=}0.013$  ) and  CPS1  (rs7422339, OR 0.96;   $95\%\mathrm{CI}\:0.92–0.99$  ;  $P{=}0.045$  ) were associated with IS at a nominal P-value   $_{({\small\mathrm{P}}<0.05)}$  , but did not pass Bonferroni corrected Pvalue of 0.0027 (  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.05/18}$  ).  

The combined GRS including the 18 independent tHcy SNPs did not show a significant association with IS (OR 1.02;   $95\%$  CI 0.91–1.15;  $\scriptstyle P=0.63$  ) (Supplementary Table III).  

# Association of tHcy associated SNPs with IS Subtypes  

Next, we investigated the association of the tHcy related SNPs with IS subtypes. For SVD, two SNPs located near  MUT  (rs9369898, OR 1.12;  $95\%\mathrm{CI}\;1.04{-}1.21$  ;  $\it{P=0.0022_{j}}$  ) and  FUT1 (rs838133, OR 1.07;  $95\%\mathrm{CI}\;1.00{-}1.15$  ;  $P{=}0.04)$  ) respectively, were nominally associated at a P-value   ${<}0.05$   (Supplementary Table IV). The variant located near  MUT  (rs9369898) also passed Bonferroni corrected P-value of 0.0027. The major allele A of rs9369898 associated with higher tHcy levels was also associated with increased risk of SVD. There was no evidence of between study heterogeneity for rs9369898   $\mathrm{{(I^{2}{=}7.4\%}}$  ; P-het  $=\!0.37$  ). The GRS including the 18 independent tHcy SNPs did not show an association with SVD risk (OR 1.1;  $95\%$  CI 0.85– 1.42;  $\it{P=0.43}$  ) (Supplementary Table III).  

For LVD, one SNP (rs838133, OR 1.08;  $95\%$  CI 1.01–1.16;  $P{=}0.018$  ) located near  FUT1 gene was associated at a nominal P-value   $_{({\small\mathrm{P}}<0.05)}$  , but did not pass Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (Supplementary Table V). The GRS of the 18 independent tHcy SNPs did not show an association with LVD risk (OR 1.06; 95%CI 0.82–1.35;  $P{=}0.64$  ) (Supplementary Table III). None of the tested SNPs were associated with CE risk even at a nominal P-value   $_{({\small\mathrm{P}}<0.05)}$   (Supplementary Table VI). In addition, the GRS of the 18 independent tHcy SNPs did not show an association with CE risk (OR 0.9;  $95\%\mathrm{CI}\;0.71-$  1.14;  $\mathit{P}{=}0.4$  ) (Supplementary Table III).  

# Investigation of associations in regions located   $\pm\mathbf{50kb}$   around the 18 tHcy associated SNPs  

As a secondary analysis, we assessed the associations with IS and its subtypes for SNPs located within  $\pm50\mathbf{k}\mathbf{b}$   of the 18 tHcy associated SNPs.  

For overall IS, three variants (rs9379800, rs17271121 and rs12664474) located within 50kb from the tHcy associated polymorphism, rs548987, were associated with IS at P-values lower than the Bonferroni corrected threshold   $(\mathrm{P=}0.05/166{=}0.0003)$  ) (Table 1). Two SNPs

 (rs9379800 and rs12664474) located upstream of  SLC17A3  were highly correlated

  $(\mathrm{r}^{2}{=}0.766)$   with each other, and moderately correlated with the third SNP, rs17271121 located in an intron of  SLC17A3    $\mathrm{r}^{2}[\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}9379800$  , rs17271121]=0.306;  $\mathrm{r}^{2}$  [rs17271121, r  $\Im{12664474}]=\!\!0.545)$  ). None of the three SNPs were in LD with the tHcy associated polymorphism, rs548987   $(\mathrm{r}^{2}{<}0.035)$  .  

In addition, another SNP rs2287921 located in an intron of  RASIP1  gene, within 50kb from the  FUT1  polymorphism, rs838133, was associated with IS at a P-value of 0.0002 (OR 0.94;  $95\%\mathrm{CI}\:0.91{-}0.97)$  , lower than Bonferroni correction for multiple testing   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.0003)$  ). This SNP was in moderate LD   $(\mathrm{r}^{2}{=}0.658)$  ) with the sentinel SNP rs838133, which may suggest that this could be a broader risk region spanning the two neighboring genes  RASIP1  and FUT1 .  

For LVD, one SNP (rs1801131), a missense variant located in  MTHFR  gene, near the two sentinel SNPs in this gene, rs1801133 and rs12134663, was associated with LVD with a Pvalue of   $1.92\!\times\!10^{-4}$   (OR 1.15;  $95\%\mathrm{CI}\;1.06{-}1.23\$  ) lower than the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing   $\scriptstyle(\mathrm{P}<0.0003)$  ). This missense SNP was in low LD with the two tHcy sentinel SNPs  $\mathrm{(r}^{2}$ [rs1801131, rs1801133 $|{=}0.19$ ; $\mathrm{r}^{2}$ [rs1801131, rs12134663]=0.268).  

For SVD, one SNP (rs566295) located upstream  MUT , 44kb from the tHcy associated polymorphism, rs9369898, was associated with SVD with a P-value of  $2.2{\times}10^{-4}$   (OR 0.87;  $95\%\mathrm{CI}\:0.80{-}0.93\$  ) passing Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. This SNP was in low LD with the  MUT  polymorphism, rs9369898   $\mathrm{{(r^{2}{=}0.264)}}$  ).  

For CE, no significant associations were observed at a threshold exceeding Bonferroni correction for multiple testing   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.0003)$  .  

# Discussion  

This large study of 12,389 IS cases and 62,004 controls, has identified several potential novel associations with IS and its subtypes by testing previously reported associations with homo cyst eine levels in stroke. We found evidence of an association of  MUT  gene with SVD, an association of  MTHFR  gene with LVD, and associations of  RASIP1  and  SLC17A3 with overall IS.  

Of the 18 tHcy polymorphisms investigated, one polymorphism located upstream of  MUT gene was significantly associated with SVD, while none of the 18 tHcy related SNPs was significantly associated with LVD, CE or overall IS. The allele correlated with increased tHcy levels at  MUT  gene showed to be also associated with increased risk of SVD suggesting a potential small but significant effect on SVD risk.  

On a closer inspection of this region, another SNP located 44kb from the sentinel SNP and in low LD with the sentinel SNP, was also associated with SVD. This polymorphism was also significantly associated with homo cyst eine levels at a genome-wide significance level  $(\mathrm{P{=}}2.27\mathrm{E{-}}09)^{11}$  , but conditional analysis has not been conducted to establish if these two polymorphisms were independently influencing homo cyst eine levels. These two polymorphisms may thus potentially be correlated with either a single, or multiple regulatory variants in this region that modulate both tHcy levels and SVD risk.  

The  MUT  gene is known to encode the mitochondrial enzyme methyl mal on yl Coenzyme A mutase, a vitamin B12-dependent enzyme. Considering that vitamin B12 is an important cofactor in homo cyst eine metabolism, a potential pleiotropic effect of  MUT  gene on both plasma homo cyst eine and vitamin B12 levels was suggested previously.  In addition, vitamin B12 deficiency is highly prevalent in SVD and may underlie blood-brain barrier damage, leading to small vessel dysfunction, especially peri ventricular white matter lesions 19 , suggesting a potential role of  MUT  polymorphisms in SVD via mechanisms involving vitamin B12 deficiency.  

Moreover, hyper homo c ystein a emi a as an independent risk factor for SVD may act via endo the li al dysfunction 20 , suggesting that homo cyst eine lowering therapy may be particularly effective in this stroke subgroup. In support of this, the VITATOPS trial found that after a 3 year vitamin B supplement ation period, the risk of stroke was reduced only in patients with symptomatic small vessel disease.  Therefore, considering that in our study the only homo cyst eine significant association was with SVD, brings more evidence to support the hypothesis that homo cyst eine may be a risk factor in particular to SVD.  

Our study also found an association with LVD, a missense variant located in  MTHFR (A1298C), 2kb from the well-studied homo cyst eine associated polymorphism  MTHFR C677T.  Previous studies showed that A1298C was associated with a decrease in  MTHFR activity, but was not associated with increased homo cyst eine levels.  The functional differences between the two polymorphisms could be explained by their location: C677T is located within the N-terminal catalytic region, while A1298C is located within the Cterminal regulatory domain, being involved in enzyme regulation.  

Given that high folate levels have been associated with a reduced effect of  MTHFR  C677T on homo cyst eine levels and stroke 22 , the non-association of  MTHFR  C677T with stroke could be explained by the inclusion in the METASTROKE study of individuals from countries where folic acid fortification has already been implemented.  The relationship between  MTHFR  A1298C and folate status has not been yet investigated and it is not known if this polymorphism is influenced by folate levels. However, if this SNP is not influenced or influenced at a lesser extent by folate status compared to C677T, may explain why A1298C polymorphism, and not C677T, was found to be associated with LVD in our stroke cohort.  

For overall IS, two highly correlated SNPs located upstream  SLC17A3  and one SNP located in an intron of  SLC17A3  were found to be associated with IS after correction for multiple testing. None of these SNPs were in LD with the sentinel polymorphism suggesting the presence of another independent potential risk locus in this region.  

SLC17A3  encodes a voltage-driven transporter that excretes intracellular urate and organic anions from the blood into renal tubule cells.  $^{23}\mathrm{\,A}$   significant association between a polymorphism (rs1165205) located in intron 1 of  SLC17A3  and serum uric acid concentrations has been found by a GWAS study.  This SNP was located up to   $80\,\mathrm{k\mathbf{b}}$   from our investigated SNPs, but was in low LD   $(\mathrm{r}^{2}{<}0.2)$   with all our  SLC17A3  SNPs suggesting. Therefore, the possibility exists that these polymorphisms are correlated with another variant that has a causal role on influencing urate levels. Alternatively, there may be several independent loci associated with urate levels in this region as it has been suggested previously 24 , and our investigated SNPs may be correlated with another polymorphism influencing urate levels independent from the GWAS reported association. Epidemiological studies have shown that elevated serum uric acid is a strong independent risk factor for hypertension 25 , and considering that hypertension is a risk factor for stroke, it has been suggested that increased uric acid levels may be involved in predicting stroke risk.  

Another association with IS was a variant located in  RASIP1  gene.  RASIP1  is required for the proper formation of vascular structures that develop via both vas cul o genesis and ang io genesis.  As it is well known that insufficient vessel growth or maintenance can lead to stroke among other disorders 28 , we provide a possible link between  RASIP1  and stroke risk. Further, this polymorphism has been reported to be significantly associated with retinal vascular caliber in a previous GWAS.  Furthermore, considering that changes in retinal vascular caliber are associated with cardiovascular diseases including  $\mathrm{IS}^{30}$  , provides more evidence of a potential role of this gene in stroke.  

So far, several GWAS have been conducted on ischemic stroke and its subtypes which have identified associations of common polymorphisms specific to each stroke subtype , endorsing the fact that different stroke subtypes have different risk factor profiles and path o physiological mechanisms. Our study supported this hypothesis and identified a potential association of  MUT  with SVD, and of  MTHFR  with LVD. In addition, we also identified potential associations of  RASIP1  and  SLC17A3  with overall IS. The reason why we did not find significant associations of  RASIP1  and  SLC17A3  with any of the stroke subtypes could be due to the smaller sample sizes and, thus reduced power of the stroke subtype cohorts. However, it is important to highlight that our findings need to be validated by replication in independent cohorts to avoid considering spurious results.  

In addition, the combined genetic score of the 18 independent tHcy SNPs did not show a significant association with overall IS or its subtypes. The low power of our study to detect small effects, together with the fact that stroke and homo cyst eine may only partly share their allelic architecture may explain the lack of association of the tHcy genotype risk score.  

However, our results apply to European population and to countries with established policies of folic acid fortification of grains. A recent study has shown that in these countries, the evidence from genetic studies and from randomised trials with folic acid suggested no benefit from lowering homo cyst eine levels for stroke prevention.  Thus, to elucidate the controversial role of homo cyst eine in stroke, future studies should be conducted in regions with low folate levels where homo cyst eine-lowering interventions may have an important effect in reducing stroke risk.  

To conclude, our study provides evidence of several potential associations with IS and its subtypes: an association of  MUT  gene with small vessel stroke, an association of  MTHFR gene with large vessel stroke, and associations of  RASIP1  and  SLC17A3  with overall IS, highlighting possible roles of these genes in IS and its subtypes.
