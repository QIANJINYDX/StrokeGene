Background and Purpose —Epidemiological studies suggest that white matter hyper intensities (WMH) are extremely  heritable, but the underlying genetic variants are largely unknown. Path o physiological heterogeneity is known to reduce  the power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hypertensive and non hypertensive individuals with WMH  might have different underlying path o logie s. We used GWAS data to calculate the variance in WMH volume (WMHV)  explained by common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as a measure of heritability (SNP heritability  $[H_{\mathrm{SNP}}]$  ) and  tested the hypothesis that WMH heritability differs between hypertensive and non hypertensive individuals.  

Methods —WMHV was measured on MRI in the stroke-free cerebral hemisphere of 2336 ischemic stroke cases with GWAS  data. After adjustment for age and intra cranial volume, we determined which cardiovascular risk factors were independent  predictors of WMHV. Using the genome-wide complex trait analysis tool to estimate  $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   for WMHV overall and within  subgroups stratified by risk factors found to be significant in multivariate analyses.  

Results —A significant proportion of the variance of WMHV was attributable to common SNPs after adjustment for  significant risk factors   $(H_{\mathrm{sNP}}{=}0.23$  ;  $\scriptstyle P=0.0026$  ).  $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   estimates were higher among hypertensive individuals   $(H_{\mathrm{swp}}{=}0.45$  ;   $\scriptstyle P=7.99\times10^{-5}$  ); this increase was greater than expected by chance (  ${\it P}{=}0.012$  ). In contrast, estimates were lower, and  non significant, in non hypertensive individuals   $(H_{\mathrm{sNP}}{=}0.13$  ;  $P{=}0.13$  ).  

Conclusions —A quarter of variance is attributable to common SNPs, but this estimate was greater in hypertensive  individuals. These findings suggest that the genetic architecture of WMH in ischemic stroke differs between hypertensive s  and non hypertensive s. Future WMHV GWAS studies may gain power by accounting for this interaction.     ( Stroke .  2015;46:348-353. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.006849.)

W hite matter hyper intensities (WMH) are an important  predictor of both stroke and cognitive impairment. Their prevalence increases markedly with age,  and hypertension is an important independent risk factor.  Both the  duration of hypertension and its severity predict the presence  and extent of WMH.  They are believed to represent cerebral  small vessel disease (SVD), although their pathogen es is is  in completely understood. Twin and family studies quantifying

WMH on MRI suggest that the heritability (proportion of disease risk explained by genetic predisposition) is as high as   $55\%$   to  $80\%$  .  Despite this, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have only identified 1 common variant increasing  WMH risk at chromosome 17q25.  

This inability of GWAS to identify the variants accounting  for the expected genetic risk, or missing heritability, has been  reported in other complex genetic diseases in which the cumulative risk explained by common variants identified by GWAS  is considerably less than that predicted by the heritability found  in epidemiological studies.  Several proposals have been suggested to account for these discrepancies, including a role for  rare variants that are not easily detectable with GWAS arrays,  as well as gene–environment interactions, and epistasis.  

Another confounding factor is potential heterogeneity of the  phenotype. If it is not accounted for in GWAS experiments,  it could markedly reduce the power to detect genetic associations. This may be particularly relevant for WMH in which  neuro pathological studies have suggested heterogeneous disease processes.  It has been suggested that smaller punctate  lesions may represent a non ischemic cause, whereas larger  confluent lesions are more likely to be due to SVD pathology.  

Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for WMH,   and in hypertensive individuals, WMH pathology may differ  from that in non hypertensive individuals, possibly with a greater  extent of ischemic SVD.  Therefore, WMH genetic architec- ture might also differ across patient subgroups defined on the  basis of vascular risk factors. We hypothesized that WMH heritability estimates would increase if the study cohort was divided  on the basis of presence or absence of WMH-associated risk  factors because of individual subgroups having reduced heterogeneity. GWAS data from unrelated individuals can be used to  obtain an estimate of heritability.  Using genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on  conventional genotyping arrays can be determined.  

To examine these associations, we used GWAS data from  2366 subjects with ischemic stroke in whom the WMH volume  (WMHV) was quantified. These individuals have more severe  WMH than do age-matched population individuals,  and this  may, therefore, increase power when examining genetic associations with WMHV. We first performed multivariate regression to determine the most important risk factors in our data.  We then used GCTA to estimate the heritability of WMH in  all individuals and in the presence and absence of risk factors,  including hypertension.  

# Methods  

# Subjects  

Patients with ischemic stroke enrolled through 7 hospital-based  studies and 1 population-based cohort underwent genome-wide genotyping and volumetric WMH analysis, as previously described 9 (Methods in the online-only Data Supplement). All subjects were  adults   $(>\!18$   years) of self-reported European ancestry, and had a diagnosis of ischemic stroke of any subtype. Exclusion criteria were  cerebral autosomal dominant arte rio path y with sub cortical infarcts  and leuk o encephalopathy, vasculitis, de myelin a ting, and mitochondrial disorders. Cohort demographics and clinical characteristics are  shown in Table 1. Cases were subtyped based on clinical features,  brain imaging, and ancillary investigation findings using the Trial  of  $\mathrm{Arg}\ 10172$   in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification. Subtyping was performed at individual recruitment centers by an experienced stroke physician or neurologist.  

# Risk Factor Definitions  

Hypertension was defined as prescription of anti hypertensive s before  stroke or systolic blood pressure  ${>}140\,\mathrm{mm\,Hg}$   or diastolic blood pressure  ${>}90\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{Hg}\,{>}1$   week post stroke. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as treatment with lipid-lowering agents before stroke or elevated  serum cholesterol   $(>5.2\;\mathrm{mmol/L})$  ) on stroke admission. Ever-smoker  was defined as current and ex-smokers. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was  defined as a previous diagnosis. Ischemic heart disease was defined as  known diagnosis of coronary artery disease or self-reported history of  angina, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, or percutaneous coronary intervention.  

# Neuro imaging Analysis  

MRI scans were acquired using different scanners at individual  centers as part of routine clinical practice for evaluation of stroke.  

WMHV was measured in the hemisphere contra lateral to acute infarction to avoid confounding by T2 hyper intense signals because of  acute stroke. Trained raters blinded to all patient information analyzed anonymized MRI scans. All supra ten to rial white matter and  deep gray matter lesions were included, with the exception of WMH  corresponding to lacunar infarcts. Each center excluded between 5  and   $12.5\%$   of MRI scans because excessive movement of artifact,  incomplete brain coverage, or bi hemispheric infarcts (other than lacunar) precluded accurate WMH quant if i cation.  

To account for normal inter individual variability in head size, an  estimate of total intra cranial volume (TICV) was derived, using sitespecific volumetric methodology.  

MRI scans from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Ischemic  Stroke Genetics Study (ISGS), and Australian Stroke Genetics  Collaborative (ASGC) studies were analyzed in Boston. Siblings  With Ischemic Stroke Study (SWISS) scans were analyzed in the  same way at the University of Virginia by the Boston-trained rater.  Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences were analyzed using an MRIcro (http://www.mricro.com), a semi automated method  described previously.  Using operator-mediated quality assurances,  overlapping regions of interest corresponding to WMH produced the  final maps for WMHV calculation. Intra cranial area was derived as a  validated marker of TICV as the average of 2 mid sagittal slices traced  using anatomic landmarks on T1 sequences.  

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium-2 (WTCCC2) and  Milan cohorts were analyzed in London using DISPunc semi automated  lesion drawing software.  WTCCC2 consisted of cases recruited from  the following centers: Munich, St. George’s, Oxford, and Edinburgh.  For WMH quant if i cation, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery was primarily used, and in its absence, T2 was used. A seed at the lesion border  was first manually marked and then outlined automatically based on  the signal intensity gradient. Regions of interest were manually corrected as required. For TICV, T2 was primarily used, and in its absence,  fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Images were segmented  using an automated program, SIENAX,  and TICV was derived by  summing cerebrospinal fluid, gray and white matter volumes.  

WMH quant if i cation agreement across the 2 main reading centers  was performed for 50 randomly selected scans; agreement was good  (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.95; confidence interval, 0.91–0.97).  

# Genotype Analysis  

All genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human660WQuad, 650K-Quad, or 610-Quad beadchips with the exception of  Massachusetts General Hospital samples genotyped on the Affymetrix  6.0 Beadchip. Standardized quality control procedures were applied  before imputation using IMPUTE version 2 (http://mathgen.stats. ox.ac.uk/impute/impute_v2.html) and HapMap3 and 1000 Genomes  Project Phase pilot (June 2010). Imputed genotype dosage data were  converted to hard-call using a strict level of confidence   $\scriptstyle(r^{2}>0.95)$   in  PLINK version 1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard  $\mathrm{\Gamma,\,edu/\approx}$  purcell/plink/).  Per-center strict quality control procedures were then applied; SNPs  that were either rare (minor allele frequency,   ${<}0.01$  ) or missing in   ${>}1\%$   of genotypes were discarded. After quality control, there were  472,591 consensus autosomal SNPs from the merged genotyped data  remaining for heritability analysis.  

# Statistical Analyses  

For statistical analyses, SPPS version 16 (http://www.ibm.com/software/uk/analytics/spss) and R version 3.1.1 (http://www.r-project. com) were used, and  $P{<}0.05$   was considered significant. To minimize  WMHV measurement biases secondary to differing imaging parameters, MRI scans from individual centers were analyzed separately  and divided into groups based on the availability of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery or T2 for WMH quant if i cation (Table I in  the online-only Data Supplement). Single-hemisphere WMHV was  doubled to obtain whole-brain values and log-transformed. WMHV  was adjusted for age and TICV by deriving standardized residuals  from a linear regression model, including these as predictors. For  SWISS samples only, WMHV was adjusted for intra cranial volume  before transformation by multiplying by the ratio of mean intracranial area:individual intra cranial area. The age- and TICV-adjusted  WMHV residuals formed the phenotype for risk factor predictor and  heritability analyses.  

# Predictors of WMHV  

Univariate regression was used to assess the relationship of binary  cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, eversmoker, sex, ischemic heart disease, and hypercholesterolemia) with  adjusted WMHV. Subjects with missing risk factors or subtype information were excluded from individual analyses. Stroke subtypes  were also assessed as predictors of adjusted WMHV. Subjects with no  determined stroke cause or  ${>}1$   potential stroke cause were excluded  from these analyses. All significant risk factors were included in a  multivariate linear regression, predicting adjusted WMHV, and those  with persistent significance were used to stratify the data for heritability analyses.  

# Heritability Analyses  

To estimate the heritability from the GWAS data, we used the genome-wide Complex Tool version 1.02 (http://www.complex traitgenomics.com/software/gcta/).  This estimates the phenotypic  variance attributable to common SNPs, referred to here as SNP heritability  $(H_{\mathrm{SNP}})$  . Statistically significant  $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   was defined as  $P{<}0.05$   for  all likelihood ratio tests applied to the analyses. First, a genetic relationship matrix was derived on a per-chromosome basis and merged  into a single autosomal matrix and adjusted for prediction errors due  to imperfect linkage d is equilibrium. One of a pair of individuals with  estimated relatedness  ${\geq}0.125$   was removed, corresponding to thirddegree relatives. Ancestry informative principal components were  derived within GCTA.  

We first calculated the  $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   of WMHV adjusted for age and TICV  in the entire cohort, using a restricted maximum likelihood, covarying for 10 ancestry principal components. To determine the effect  of controlling for clinically important covariates, we performed a  second analysis in which sex and hypertension status were added as  covariates.  

To test the hypothesis that WMH heritability increases in risk  factor–defined groups, we derived   $H_{\mathrm{SNP}}$   in subjects subgrouped on  the basis of presence or absence of significant predictors of WMHV.  In these stratified analyses, WMHV was adjusted only for age and  TICV. We needed to determine whether increases in  $H_{\mathrm{SNP}}$   in the presence of risk factors were significantly more than expected by chance.  One thousand permutations were performed in which subsets of individuals were selected randomly at rates reflecting the risk factor  prevalence in individual centers (Table  1).   $H_{\mathrm{SNP}}$   was calculated in  these subsets, and  $P$   values reflected the proportion of permutations  in which  $H_{\mathrm{SNP}}$   was greater or equal to the observed  $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   within risk  factor–defined groups.  

We also applied bivariate linear mixed modeling within GCTA 22 to calculate the genetic correlation of WMHV, in the presence and  absence of significant risk factors, as tagged by genome-wide SNPs.  In this setting, genetic correlation reflects the extent to which genetic susceptibility is shared between risk factor–defined subgroups.  Finally, genotype–environment interactions were investigated using  a model that included the main effects of the environmental factor  as fixed effects and the genotype–environment interaction effect as  random effects to estimate the variance of the genotype–environment  interaction term.  

# Results  

# Predictors of WMHV  

In univariate analyses, female sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and SVD stroke subtype were significant predictors of  WMHV (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). After  multivariate linear regression, female sex   $(B{=}0.097\$  ;  $\mathrm{SE=}0.061$  ;   $P{=}0.021$  ), hypertension status   $\mathit{B}\!\!=\!\!0.138\$  ;  $\mathrm{SE=}0.045$  ;  $P{=}0.02$  ),  and SVD stroke subtype status   $(B{=}0.430$  ;  $\mathrm{SE=}0.061$  ;  ${\cal P}{<}0.001$  )  independently predicted WMHV (Table III in the online-only  Data Supplement), and they were, therefore, taken forward to  stratified heritability analyses. The small number of SVD subtype individuals, however, precluded SVD stratified heritability analyses using GCTA.  

# Heritability Analyses  

We estimated that a significant proportion of age- and TICVadjusted WMHV variance was attributable to common SNPs   $(H_{\mathrm{swp}}{=}0.21$  ;  $\mathrm{SE}{=}0.09$  ;  $\scriptstyle P=0.0065$  ; Table 2).  $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   estimates for  WMHV remained stable after additional adjustment for sex  and hypertension status   $(H_{\mathrm{sNP}}{=}0.23$  ;  $\mathrm{SE=}0.09$  ;  $\scriptstyle P=0.0026$  ).  

$H_{\mathrm{SNP}}$   estimates were higher among hypertensive individuals   $(H_{\mathrm{swp}}{=}0.45$  ;  $\mathrm{SE}{=}0.12$  ;  $\scriptstyle P=7.99\times10^{-5}$  ), and this increase was  greater than that expected by chance   $_{\mathit{P}=0.012}$   from permutation). In contrast, estimates were lower and non significant in  non hypertensive individuals   $(H_{\mathrm{SNR}}{=}0.13$  ;   $\mathrm{SE}{=}0.25$  ;   $P{=}0.13$  ).   $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   was also higher among women (0.40 versus 0.18 in men),  but this was not greater than that expected by chance   $P{=}0.164$    from permutation).  

We estimated the degree of genetic correlation of WMHV  in the presence and absence of significant risk factors. We  identified a significant genetic correlation between men and  women (  $\langle r^{2}\!\!=\!\!0.83$  ;   $P{=}0.04$  ). Conversely, we found no significant genetic correlation in WMHV between hypertensive and  non hypertensive individuals (  $(r^{2}{=}0.15$  ;  $\it{P=0.40}$  ). These results  indicate that SNPs predicting WMHV are shared between  men and women, but they differ for hypertensive s and nonhyper tens ives. This was also supported by interaction analyses,  which revealed significant gene–environment interaction with  hypertension status   $(V_{\mathrm{g\times}}=\!\!0.33$  ;   $\mathrm{SE=}0.17$  ;  ${\it P}{=}0.017$  ) but not  with sex   $(P{=}0.50$  ; Table 3), indicating that genetic risk factors  interact with hypertension status to increase WMHV.  

# Discussion  

Using GWAS data from ischemic stroke cohorts, we found  that a significant proportion of variance in WMHV is attributable to common SNPs on genome-wide arrays with an heritability estimate of  $21\%$   to  $23\%$  . In comparison, using similar  heritability methods has given  $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   estimates of  $38\%$   in ischemic stroke,  $24\%$   in Alzheimer disease, and  $30\%$   in multiple  sclerosis.  Our WMHV heritability estimates are considerably lower than those from twin and family studies, which

range between   $55\%$   and   $80\%$  .  Our results suggest that a  major reason for the lower heritability estimates from GCTA  may be heterogeneity in the WMH phenotype, with different genetic architecture in hypertensive and non hypertensive  individuals.  

Apart from age, hypertension is the most important conventional risk factor for WMH.  We found significantly greater  heritability estimates of   $45\%$   in the hypertensive group compared with  $13\%$   in non hypertensive individuals. We found that  a significant proportion of WMHV phenotypic variance was  attributable to a hypertension–gene interaction. This indicates  that different genetic variations contribute to WMHV in the  presence and absence of hypertension. In contrast, the high  genetic correlation between sexes   $(r^{2}{=}0.83)$  ) without evidence  of an interaction by sex indicates shared WMH causes in men  and women, as would be expected. Therefore, the  $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   difference across sexes is likely driven by nongenetic factors,  and our finding that female sex is a predictor of WMH could  reflect sex differences in physiological, immune, or behavioral  risk factors 25  not accounted for in these analyses.  

Estimates of heritability derived from genome-wide data are  often lower when compared with those derived from pedigreebased studies,  and there are many reasons for this. Unlike  genome-wide data, pedigree-based heritability estimates capture the variance not only from common variants but also from  rare, structural, and poorly tagged variants.  They are also  susceptible to over estimation because of shared family environments.  Our data demonstrate that phenotypic heterogeneity could also contribute to this discrepancy because traits are  likely to be less varied in pathogen es is within families than in  unrelated individuals. This is particularly relevant to WMH, a  radiological marker of various path o physiological processes.  Consistent with this, the  $H_{\mathrm{NP}}$   for WMHV is high in cerebral  autosomal dominant arte rio path y with sub cortical infarcts  and leuk o encephalopathy   $(H_{_\mathrm{SNF}}{=}0.85)$  ), a monogenic disease  characterized by confluent WMH secondary to a small-vessel  arte rio path y.  

Our results support the hypothesis of reduced WMH heterogeneity among risk factor–defined subgroups and also suggest that different path o physiological mechanisms contribute  to disease in hypertensive s and non hypertensive s, consistent  with pathological data.  

There are several limitations in this study. First, we use  genome-wide data from several cohorts genotyped using various platforms. To minimize propagating genotyping bias, we  applied strict levels of imputation confidence and genotyping  call rates to derive a consensus set of SNPs. As a result of limited  coverage, heritability estimates are likely to be conservative.  Second, our cohorts were drawn from several international  studies, giving the potential for population stratification; however, we show that all samples used are European in ancestry.  Furthermore, there are differences in risk factor rates (Table 1)  among cohorts, raising the possibility of systematic diagnostic  biases underlying differences in risk factor–stratified heritability estimates. However, WMHV genome–wide analyses did  not reveal significant inflation of test statistics  $\left(\lambda{\le}1.05\right)$   overall  or within risk factor–stratified groups (for QQ plots).  

In summary, our results suggest that different genetic influences may operate in WMH in hypertensive individuals compared with those found in non hypertensive individuals. Our  results suggest that future GWAS studies in WMH may gain  power by stratifying by hypertension status or by including  a gene–hypertension interaction term in association models.  Furthermore, these data may prove relevant to the future studies of other complex phenotypes.
