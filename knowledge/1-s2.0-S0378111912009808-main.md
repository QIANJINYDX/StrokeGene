Blood stasis syndrome of ischemic stroke (BSS-IS) is a common clinical phenotype that may be affected by certain mutagenic environmental factors or chemotherapeutic drugs; however, the role of susceptibility genes remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that ischemic stroke (IS) was closely associated with the Glu298Asp polymorphism in the eNOS gene and the 677C-T   $(\mathsf{A l a}\!\!\to\!\!\mathsf{V a l})$  ) polymorphism in methylene tetra hydro folate reductase (MTHRF) gene. Therefore, these two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected to detect their associations with BSS-IS in this study. A SNP chip was employed to screen the SNP variation between both groups, and the results were veri ﬁ ed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The results con ﬁ rmed that the TT genotype of Glu298Asp in the eNOS gene may be one of the risk factors associated with BSS-IS, while the genotype of 677C-T (Ala → Val) in the MTHRF gene may not be relevant to BSS-IS.

et al., 1997 ). At present, it is generally accepted that eNOS is most closely associated with the incidence of IS ( Berger et al., 2007; Saidi et al., 2010 ) and that NO concentration plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of IS ( Nishikawa et al., 1993 ). Genotype and allele frequencies of polymorphism in eNOS between IS patients and healthy controls have been found to be signi ﬁ cantly different in Indian populations ( Munshi et al., 2010 ). Previous studies have shown that the Glu298asp polymorphism in eNOS gene within exon 7 (NCBI SNP cluster rs1799983; GenBank accession number NG_011992; protein accession number NP_000594) is closely associated with IS ( Berger et al., 2007; Saidi et al., 2010 ). A mis-sense mutation of Glu298Asp causes a conformation al change in eNOS, reduces its activity, and inevitably increases the subject's susceptibility to IS ( Saidi et al., 2010 ).  

# 1. Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multi factorial disease ( Wang et al., 2009 ), and its molecular etiology involves interaction between many genes and environmental factors ( Jood et al., 2005 ). Mutations in several candidate genes have been found to be associated with stroke ( Munshi and Kaul, 2010 ). Sustained NO generation is primarily adjusted by eNOS in physiological conditions, and thus, polymorphism in the eNOS gene is closely associated with NO concentration in vivo ( Wang  

Recently,an association between mutations of methylene tetra hydro folate reductase (MTHFR) gene and ischemic stroke has been reported ( Low et al., 2011 ). MTHFR 677C-T   $(\mathsf{A l a}\!\!\to\!\!\mathsf{V a l})$  ) was a risk factor for ischemic stroke ( Usacheva et al., 2012 ). A common polymorphism exists in the gene that encodes the MTHFR enzyme, as required for the conversion of homo cyst eine to methionine. Individuals who have T genotype of the MTHFR gene (677T) have lower enzyme activity and higher homo cyst eine and lower folate levels than those without this genotype ( García-Pinilla et al., 2007 ). The 677C-T mutation might result in impaired folate metabolism, leading to high homo cyst eine concentrations, which was causally related to IS risk ( Deloughery et al., 1996 ).  

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome is the nature of a certain stage of the disease. IS includes several syndromes, in which blood stasis syndrome (Xueyu ZHENG) is one of the most common phenotypes ( Sun, 2007 ). Blood stasis is not only an important risk factor but also one of the pathological products of IS. Although a signi ﬁ cant association has been con ﬁ rmed between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the eNOS gene or MTHFR gene and the risk of IS, the associations between blood stasis syndrome of IS (BSS-IS) and SNP in the eNOS and MTHFR gene still remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the frequencies of polymorphisms in eNOS and MTHFR gene in BSS-IS and non-BSS-IS patients. The eNOS gene allele frequency in these patients was evaluated and compared, and a detailed association among syndromes, SNP in the eNOS and MTHFR gene, and the susceptibility to IS was described.  

# 2. Patients and methods  

# 2.1. Patients  

Patients were consecutively recruited from XiYuan Hospital in Beijing, China. A hospital based case – control study was used, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.  

Diagnosis of IS and TCM syndrome was established according to clinical symptoms and signs. The clinical features of BSS include tingling, ecchymosis, dark purple tongue, and so on. The criteria for diagnosis of IS and BSS used in this study were based on guiding principles for clinical research of Chinese new herbal medicines ( Zheng, 2002 ).  

Patients with transient ischemic attack; those with cerebral embolism derived from brain tumor, brain trauma, cerebral parasitic diseases, metabolism disorders, rheumatic heart disease, and atrial ﬁ brillation; and those with comorbid conditions, including other serious diseases and/or psychiatric disorders were excluded from the study. A detailed clinical questionnaire concerning different features of the disease was used.  

Data regarding age, age at diagnosis, gender, medical history, and comorbid conditions were collected from all eligible patients.  

# 2.2. Methods  

# 2.2.1. DNA extraction  

The Wizard Genomic DNA Puri ﬁ cation Kit (Promega Co. Ltd.) was used for the isolation of genomic DNA. DNA samples collected from selected patients were analyzed for variants of the eNOS and MTHFR gene using melting curve analysis.  

# 2.2.2. Gene ampli ﬁ cation  

The Cy5  ﬂ uorescent labeled primers and restriction enzymes (Sangon Biotech Shanghai Co. Ltd.) for each SNP used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were as follows: nsp9a2,   $5^{\prime}$  -GGGG G GC AGA AG GAA GAG TT $.3^{\prime}$  ; nsp9s3F,  $5^{\prime}$  -CY5-GCTGCA GGCCC CAG ATGA  $.3^{\prime}$   (in the eNOS gene Glu298asp ampli ﬁ cation site). MTHFR:  $5^{\prime}$  -CAA AG GCC A CCCC GAA GC 3,  $5^{\prime}$  -AG GAC GG TG CG GT GAGA GT G 3 ′ (in the MTHFR gene 677C-T   $(\mathsf{A l a}\!\!\to\!\!\mathsf{V a l})$   ampli ﬁ cation site).  

We identi ﬁ ed and optimized multiple PCR ampli ﬁ cations by single ampli ﬁ cation and performed PCR using   $0.3\;\mathrm{U}$   of rTaq polymerase  $(5~\mathrm{U}/\upmu\mathrm{l}$  , Takara),  $400\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{l}$   dNTPs (  $2.5~\mathrm{mM}$  , Promega), and  $0.1\ \upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{l}$  of each primer in a total volume of   $25\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  . For Glu298Asp SNP/677C-T in the eNOS and MTHFR gene, multiple PCR ampli ﬁ cation was performed as follows: ampli ﬁ cation at  $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $2.5~\mathrm{min}$  , at  $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\ s$  , at  $57~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30~s$  , at   $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~s$  , followed by 35 cycles, and a ﬁ nal extension at   $72~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for   $5~\mathrm{min}$  . Ampli ﬁ cation was veri ﬁ ed by   $2\%$  agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products were not puri ﬁ ed, but directly hybridized.  

# 2.2.3. SNP detection  

We designed an oli go nucleotide probe for detection of the genes after consulting the NCBI gene database. Probe sequences are listed in  Table 1 .  

A clean glass slide was processed in a  $95\%$   acetone and   $10\%$   pyridine (containing  $2\%$   PDC) solution and spotted at   $4\,^{\circ}C$   after airing. We prepared the spotting solution by dissolving synthetic oli go nucleotide probes and determined the  ﬁ nal concentration of the probes at  $0.1\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{l}.$   The layout design of the SNP microarray is described in  Table 2 .  

The ampli ﬁ ed samples of the eNOS and MTHRF gene were ampliﬁ ed at   $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and hybridized at   $48~^{\circ}C$   for   $2\textrm{h}$  . The products were scanned using a ScanArray 4000 scanner at  $649\;\mathrm{nm}$  , and the signal strength was recorded. Scan results were analyzed with scanner image processing software. If the ratio was  ${>}2$   but  ${\tt<}0.5$  , the product was considered a homozygote and if the ratio was  $\geq\!0.5$   but    ${\leq}2$  , the product was considered to be a heterozygote.  

To verify the validity of the results, we detected the variants of eNOS gene using denaturing high-performance liquid chroma to graphy (DHPLC) (WAVE ™ , Trans genomic, UK) in 25 randomly selected BSS-IS patients and 25 controls. The altered mobility down the acetonitrile column was monitored and analyzed by WAVEMAKER ™ Version 4.1.25 software. The sample was considered to have the same genotype as the homozygote if a single peak was observed, whereas multiple peaks indicated heterozygotes. At the same time, we also detected the genotype of 677C-T   $(\mathsf{A l a}\!\!\to\!\!\mathsf{V a l})$  ) in the MTHRF gene in 20 randomly selected patients using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).  

# 2.2.4. Statistical analysis  

SPSS 12.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis. The allele and genotype frequencies between both groups were compared based on the  $\chi^{2}$    test or Fisher's exact test. The correlation between genotype and BSS-IS was presented as an odds ratio (OR) and  $95\%$  con ﬁ dence interval (CI). p values were considered signi ﬁ cant at a level of  ${<}0.05$  .  

# 3. Results  

The study population comprised 89 BSS-IS patients (64 males, 25 females; mean age,   $68.6\pm10.5$   years) and 102 non-BSS-IS patients (74 males, 28 females; mean age,   $67.5\pm9.9$   years). No signi ﬁ cant differences were observed between both groups in terms of gender and age   $\left(\mathtt{p}\!>\!0.05\right)$  . Both groups had showed no differences in terms of emerging diabetes, coronary heart disease, and hypertension. A comparison of the basic characteristics between the two groups is shown in  Table 3 .  

After the genomic DNA was diluted at 1:40, the average optical density at   $260~\mathrm{nm}$   using a spectrophotometer was found to be 0.30 and the average concentration was   $583.65\ \mathrm{ng}/\upmu\mathrm{l}$  . The electro ph ore tic bands of the samples were clear, and the speci ﬁ city was relatively high using single PCR ampli ﬁ cation ( Fig. 1 ). Multiple PCR ampli ﬁ cation

results were used for further analysis. The ninth band showed the PCR products to be nsp9a2 and nsp9s3F of eNOS, while the  ﬁ fth band showed the PCR products to be 677C-T   $._{\mathrm{Ala}\rightarrow\mathrm{Vad}})$  ) of the MTHFR gene ( Fig. 2 ).  

The chip quality was controlled in our study. Positive probes were saturated or supersaturated, and the results con ﬁ rmed the feasibility of the hybrid system. All hybrid signals of negative and blank controls were lower than 200, which indicated that the hybrid system was clean and the false positive rate was low. All samples were tested ﬁ ve times using the chip, and results were identical with a repetition rate of   $100\%$  . The results demonstrated that the hybridization conditions were stable.  

A Hardy – Weinberg balance veri ﬁ cation demonstrated that the genotype of the study population met the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium (BSS-IS group:    $\chi^{2}\!=\!2.235$  ,   $\mathsf{p}\!=\!0.639\!>\!0.05$  ; non-BSS-IS group:  $\chi^{2}\!=\!0.228$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!=\!0.738\!>\!0.05$  ). The actual genotype frequency was consistent with the expected frequency. It could be con ﬁ rmed that the DNA samples collected from the randomly selected patients were representative of the genotype distribution among the entire patient population.  

Allele frequency of Glu298Asp in the eNOS and 677C-T   $(\mathsf{A l a}\!\!\to\!\!\mathsf{V a l})$  ) in the MTHRF gene in IS patients is shown in  Table 4 . A signi ﬁ cant difference in the frequency of Glu298Asp mutant allele in the eNOS gene was found between both groups (  $\cdot\chi^{2}\!=\!6.398$  ,  $\mathsf{p\!=\!0.041}.$  ). The frequency of TT mutant allele in BSS-IS patients was signi ﬁ cantly higher   $(23.03\%)$   than that in non-BSS-IS patients (  $16.18\%,$  ,   $\mathsf{p\!=\!}0.013$  ; OR: 4.654;  $95\%$   CI: 1.255 – 17.259). No signi ﬁ cant difference in the frequency of GG mutant allele was noted between both groups  $\stackrel{\cdot}{,}\chi^{2}\!=\!0.407$  ,  $\mathsf{p\!=\!}0.523.$  ). The frequency of GT mutant allele in the BSS-IS group was not signi ﬁ cantly different from that in the non-BSS-IS group (  $\cdot\chi^{2}\!=\!0.682$  ,   $\mathsf{p\!=\!0.409},$  ). However, there was no difference in allele frequency of the MTHRF gene between BSS-IS and non-BSS-IS patients   $\cdot\chi^{2}\!=\!0.759$  ,  $\mathsf{p\!=\!0.684}.$  ).  

The homozygous ( Fig. 3 a) and heterozygous ( Fig. 3 b) genotypes identi ﬁ ed by DHPLC analysis were consistent with the results of SNP chip analysis. The result from RFLP was showed in  Fig. 4 . The electrophoresis of products digested showed that 677C-T   $(\mathsf{A l a\!\to\!V a l})$   in the MTHRF gene included three genotypes (CC, TT and CT). CC genotype was not digested, TT genotype was digested into 174 bp and 72 bp fragments, while one of the CT genotypes was digested and another one was not digested. There are 4 CC genotypes, 7 TT genotypes and  $11\,\mathrm{CT}$  genotypes in 20 randomly selected patients. The frequency matching with the chip was  $95\%$  . It con ﬁ rmed that the results were reliable.

Fig. 1.  PCR ampli ﬁ cation of eNOS gene. Based on a single PCR ampli ﬁ cation of the seven target genes, the results of multiple PCR ampli ﬁ cation were acceptable. The DL2000 Marker was selected. The  ﬁ rst, second, fourth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth bands indicate the primer products nsp1s and nsp1aF, nsp2a and nsp1sF, nsp4a and nsp4sF, nsp7s2 and nsp7a2F, nsp8a and nsp8sF, nsp9a2 and nsp9s3F, and nsp10s and nsp10aF. The mixture represents multiple PCR products.  

# 4. Discussion  

In our study, we investigated the GG, GT, and TT genotype frequency of the eNOS gene in both groups. It is believed that Glu298Asp SNP in the eNOS gene plays critical roles in the pathogen es is

of IS. Our study con ﬁ rms that there are indeed signi ﬁ cant differences in genotypes between both groups.  

First, we performed a conventional single association analysis of TCM syndrome and relevant genotypes. This analysis revealed that TT allele in the eNOS gene is associated with the BSS syndrome in IS patients. Our  ﬁ ndings are consistent with the previous  ﬁ ndings that BSS patients account for the majority of the Chinese IS population ( He et al., 2007 ).  

However, the combined effect of Glu298Asp polymorphism in the eNOS gene on IS is based on the function and expression of eNOS and a substantial in ﬂ uence on atherosclerosis ( Godfrey et al., 2007 ). Previous studies have evaluated the association between the eNOS gene Glu298Asp SNPs and the risk factors for atherosclerosis or coronary disease ( Cam et al., 2005; Kerkeni et al., 2006; Lamblin et al., 2005; Srivastava et al., 2005; Szabó et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2006 ), in which the GG, GT, and TT genotypes were detected, and the TT genotype was identi ﬁ ed to be a major risk factor ( Cam et al., 2005; Godfrey et al., 2007; Srivastava et al., 2005 ). Because the incidence of stroke is closely associated with arterial injury, our  ﬁ ndings further con ﬁ rm the relationship between the TT mutant allele and IS.  

How the mechanism of the accumulation of TT alleles in ﬂ uences the development of IS through atherosclerosis should be investigated in future studies. The increase in atherosclerosis induced by TT mutant allele frequency probably plays an important role because there is a statistically signi ﬁ cant relationship between TT allele frequency and hypertension, a risk factor of IS. At present, research has shown that carriage of the Asp298 variant of the eNOS gene is associated with a blunted endothelium-dependent va so dilation. In particular, the TT variant has a decreased va so dilatory response to acetylcholine, and accordingly increased vascular tension, which leads to BSS-IS ( Godfrey et al., 2007 ). However, it should be noted that because analysis was performed based on cross-sectional data,

Fig. 4.  The electrophoresis of products digested in the MTHFR gene. We determined the three genotypes according to HinfI digestion fragment. CC genotype was not digested and only included a kind of fragment. TT genotype was digested into 174 bp and 72 bp fragments. One was digested and another was not digested in CT genotype.  

a long-term follow-up study would be required. To some extent, the previously mentioned study could explain our conclusion that the TT mutant allele greatly increases susceptibility to BSS-IS.  

In conclusion, the accumulation of Glu298Asp SNP in the eNOS gene is probably associated with the emergence of BSS in IS patients. In the future, we will clarify the effects of Glu298Asp eNOS in BSS-IS patients. The results in this study indicate that it is possible to examine the different syndromes of IS based on gene polymorphisms. This approach may represent a new method to assess TCM syndromes.
