Ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction are fatal diseases and are among the top 10 causes of death in  Korea, including arterial thr ombo embo li c events. Many previous studies have described the function of inter­ leukin-6 (IL-6) in arterial thr ombo embo li c events and the association between promoter single-nucleotide poly­ morphism (SNP) (rs1800795; -174, G/C) of the  IL-6  gene. However, these results were controversial. Therefore,  we performed a meta-analysis to more precisely assess the association between the SNP of the  IL-6  gene and  susceptibility to arterial thr ombo embo li c events.  

# Background:  

We used PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS) electronic  databases. Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (Corporation, NJ) was used to evaluate the relationship be­ tween rs1800795 SNP of  IL-6  gene and risk of arterial thr ombo embo li c events. Odds ratio (OR),  $95\%$   confidence  interval (CI), and  $P$   value were also calculated. The 13 eligible studies were analyzed in the meta-analysis. The present meta-analysis found that rs1800795 SNP of  IL-6  gene is not significantly associated with suscep­ tibility to arterial thr ombo embo li c events (C allele  vs . G allele,   $\mathtt{O R}{=}1.04$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathsf{C l e0.91}$  1–1.19,  $P{=}0.619$  ; CC  vs .   $\mathsf{C G}\!+\!\mathsf{G G}$  ,  $\mathtt{O R}{=}1.09$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}\!\!=\!\!0.91\!\!-\!\!1.31$  ,  $P{=}0.364$  ;  $\mathsf{C C}\!+\!\mathsf{C G}$    vs . GG,  $\mathsf{O R}{=}0.97$  ,  $95\%$   $,{\mathsf{C l}}{=}0.78{-}1.21$  1,  $P{=}0.763$  , respec­ tively), and the SNP of  IL-6  gene also did not show any significant association with ischemic stroke or myocar­ dial infarction (  $(P{>}0.05$   in each model).  

# Material/Methods:  

# Results:  

We found that rs1800795 SNP of  $I L–6$   gene was not related to arterial thr ombo embo li c events. However, fur­ ther study will be needed to confirm these results.

# Background  

Arterial thr ombo embo li c events may be caused by arterial throm­ bosis, which is the formation of a thrombus within an artery.  Arterial thrombosis is closely related to arterial diseases such  as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction [1]. According to  the American Heart Association, stroke is a fatal cerebrovas­ cular disease and the leading cause of death and disability in  the United States. In Korea, stroke is the second most com­ mon cause of death, and in 2014 it accounted for 50.3 deaths  per 100 000 people aged over 65 years, according to Statistics  Korea [2]. The age-standardized incidence of ischemic stroke in  the population of people aged 35–74 years has been increas­ ing annually, and ischemic stroke accounted for  $76\%$   of all cas­ es of strokes in 2009, with a 90-day mortality rate of  $3{-}7\%$   [3].  Statistics Korea also reported 19.6 deaths due to myocardial in­ farction per 100 000 people in Korea in 2012 ( http://kostat.go.kr ).  

Many pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to be involved  in the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Cytokines such  as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa )  could play important roles in stroke and have been detected in  the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with stroke [4]. Several stud­ ies have suggested that plasma levels of TNF $\cdot0$   and IL-6 are as­ sociated with patient prognosis following ischemic stroke [5].  Associations between IL-6 and atherosclerosis and card i ovas cu­ lar disease have also been previously reported [6]. Additionally,  previous epidemiological data have shown that IL-6 is associ­ ated with clinical and sub clinical cardiovascular diseases [7].  IL-6 plays a major role in the synthesis of human acute-phase  protein, and plasma IL-6 levels are elevated in patients with  acute myocardial infarction [8]. A previous  in vivo  study found  that IL $\cdot|\upbeta$   stimulates myocardial injury after IL-6 is induced in  endo the li al cells and fi br oblasts [9]. IL-6 induces a prothrom­ botic state by increasing expression of tissue factor, activation  of endo the li al cells, and increasing platelet production, and by  reducing the levels of inhibitors of hemostasis [10].  

IL-6  gene is located at 7p21 and encodes a cytokine that plays  a role in inflammation and B cell maturation ( http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov ). Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), -174,  G/C SNP and -572, G/C SNP have been identified in the promot­ er region of the  IL-6  gene, which might have an effect on IL-6  transcription and plasma IL-6 levels [11–13]. The rs1800795  polymorphism has been examined in many previous studies.  An association between  Helicobacter pylori  infection and de­ creased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels could be trans­ mitted through its genotype of the  IL-6  gene [14]. In patients  with type 2 diabetes, rs1800795 SNP of the  IL-6  gene is signif­ icantly related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease [15].  In addition, rs1800795 SNP of the  IL-6  gene is related with au­ toimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus [16],  systemic sclerosis [17], and autoimmune thyroid disease [18].  

Although several previous studies have investigated the asso ­ ciation between rs1800795 polymorphism and ischemic stroke  or myocardial infarction risk, these results remain controver­ sial. As the evidence suggests that IL-6 plays a major role in  thr ombo embo li c mechanisms, the aim of this meta-analy­ sis was to evaluate the association between rs1800795 poly­ morphism (-174, G/C) of the  IL-6  gene   and arterial thrombo­ embolic events.  

# Material and Methods  

# Search strategy  

For the meta-analysis, we searched for published studies that  considered the relationship between arterial thr ombo embo li c  events and polymorphism of the  IL-6  gene. To identify all eli­ gible studies that investigated the association between -176,  G/C SNP of the  IL-6  gene and susceptibility of arterial throm­ boembolic events, we performed a literature search in PubMed,  Embase, Google Scholar, and Korean Studies Information Service  System (KISS) electronic databases until January 1, 2016. The  search terms were; “interleukin  $\cdot6"$  , “IL  $\cdot6^{u}$  , or “IL6”, AND “poly­ morphism”, “polymorphisms”, or “variant” AND “rs1800795”,  or”-174” AND “ischemic stroke”, “myocardial infarction”. We  also searched previous meta-analyses of  IL-6  gene polymor­ phism (-174, G/C polymorphism) and ischemic stroke or myo­ cardial infarction.  

# Inclusion criteria  

Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1)  evaluated the association between the  IL-6  polymorphism  (-174, G/C) and ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction; (2)  study design using the methodology of a case-control study;  (3) complete distribution of polymorphism (-174, G/C) of the  IL-6  gene in the disease group and the control group to deter­ mine odds ratio (OR),  $95\%$   confidence interval (CI), and  $P$   val­ ue; (4) only studies in white populations were included, and  studies of Asian populations were excluded.  

# Data extraction  

Two investigators independently searched titles and abstracts  in articles. Irrelevant and incompatible studies were excluded.  The investigators extracted data and reached consensus on all  of the items. If the investigators generated different results,  they checked the data again and had a discussion to come to  an agreement. The following information were extracted from  each study: (1) first author’s name; (2) year of publication; (3)  country; (4) number of cases and controls; (5) genotype fre­ quency of  IL-6  gene polymorphism (-174, C/G).

# Statistical analysis  

Comprehensive meta-analysis software (Corporation, NJ) was  used to perform the meta-analysis. The pooled OR,  $95\%$   CI,  and  $P$   value were used to measure associations between sus­ ce pti bil it y of arterial thr ombo embo li c events and IL-6 poly­ morphism (-174, G/C). Firstly, we calculated the heterogeneity  of studies. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using  the Q statistic and  $I^{2}$   test. When the result of the Q test was   $P{<}0.05$   or  $I^{2}$   statistic was  ${\tt>}50\%$  , the random-effects MantelHaenszel method was used to determine if there was signif­ icant heterogeneity between studies. When the result of the  Q test was  $P{>}0.05$   or  $I^{2}$   statistic was  $\langle50\%$  , the fixed-effects  Mantel-Haenszel method was used.  

For meta-analysis of  IL-6  gene polymorphism (-174, C/G), the  pooled ORs,   $95\%$   CI, and p value were calculated using com­ bination of genotype. We first estimated the risks of  $\mathrm{{}^{u}C}$   allele  vs . G allele”, “C/C genotype  $\mathsf{\Omega}+\mathsf{C}/\mathsf{G}$   genotype  vs . G/G genotype”,  and  ${}^{u}\mathsf{C}/\mathsf{C}$   genotype  vs . C/G genotype  $\mathsf{\Omega}+\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{G}$   genotype” on arte­ rial thr ombo embo li c events, assuming dominant and recessive  effects of the variant C allele, respectively. Subgroup analyses  were carried out by ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction. The   $P{<}0.05$   was regarded as a statistically significant association.  

# Results  

# Study characteristics  

To assess the association between polymorphism  $(\cdot174,\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{C})$   of  IL-6  gene and susceptibility to arterial thr ombo embo li c events,  related studies were retrieved based on the search strategy.  First, we searched related studies on arterial thr ombo em bol­ ic events including ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.  Our meta-analysis was limited to case-control design with pro­ moter polymorphism  $(\cdot174,\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{C})$   of the  IL-6  gene and ischemic  stroke or myocardial infarction in white populations. Although  6 articles were studied with polymorphism (-174, G/C) of  IL-6   gene and susceptibility of ischemic stroke or myocardial in­ farction in Asian populations [19–24], the articles were exclud­ ed in the meta-analysis. Finally, 13 eligible articles were se­ lected [25–37]. The characteristics of these 13 eligible studies  are summarized in Table 1. The 13 studies consisted of 6 arti­ cles on ischemic stroke and 7 articles on myocardial infarction.  

# Quantitative synthesis for arterial thr ombo embo li c events  

Table 2 and Figure 1 shows overall results between  IL-6  gene  polymorphism (-174, G/C) and susceptibility to arterial throm­ boembolic events. We analyzed whether risk of the C allele and  combined genotype of the SNP were related with s usc ep tibi li­ ty of arterial thr ombo embo li c events. The results of the Q test  were  $P$   value or  I2 statistic in analysis of C allele  vs . G allele, CC

genotype  vs . CG genotype  $\mathsf{\lambda+G G}$   genotype, and CC genotype  $\mathsf{\lambda+C G}$  genotype  vs . GG genotype were  $<\!0.05$   and  ${\tt>}50\%$  , the randomeffects Mantel-Haenszel method was used (Table 2). In analy ­ sis, the pooled ORs and  $P$   value in allele model and combined  genotype models did not show any significant association with  susceptibility of arterial thr ombo embo li c events (C allele  vs .  G allele,  $\mathrm{0}\mathtt{R}\!\!=\!\!1.04$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathsf{C}\vert\!\!=\!\!0.91$  1–1.19,  $P{=}0.619$  ; CC genotype  vs .

We also performed subgroup analyses of ischemic stroke  and myocardial infarction. However,  IL-6  gene polymorphism  (-174, G/C) did not show any significant association with isch­ emic stroke (C allele  vs . G allele,  $\mathsf{O R}\!\!=\!\!0.99$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C l e}_{}^{}$  ,   $P{=}0.930$  ; CC genotype  vs .

GG  genotype,  $\mathsf{O R}\!\!=\!\!0.98$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathsf{C l e}_{}0.50\!\!-\!\!1.92$  ,  $P{=}0.931$  , respective­ ly) (Table 2, Figure 2) and myocardial infarction (C allele  vs .  G allele,  $\mathsf{O R}\!\!=\!\!1.07$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}\!=\!0.94\!-\!1.22$  ,  $P{=}0.319$  ; CC genotype  vs . CG genotype  $+\mathsf{G G}$   genotype,  $\mathtt{O R}{=}1.17$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}\!\!=\!\!0.93\!\!-\!\!1.46$  ,   $P{=}0.187$  ; CC genoty  $\mathsf{\Omega e}\!+\!\mathsf{C G}$   genotype  vs . GG genotype,  $\mathsf{O R}\!\!=\!\!0.99$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I\!\!=\!\!0.88}$  –1.11,  $P{=}0.778$  , respectively) (Table 2, Figure 3).  

To assess publication bias, Begg’s funnel plot was used out and  Egger’s test was calculated. The funnel plot was symmetrical  (data not shown), suggesting that there was no publication  bias. Additionally, Egger’s test showed quantitative evidence  for absence of publication bias   $(P{>}0.05$   in each model, Table 2).  

# Discussion  

According to Statistics Korea, stroke and cardiovascular diseas­ es were among the top 10 causes of death in Korea in 2014.  Among them, stroke is the number 2 cause of death ( http://ko­ stat.go.kr ). According to the Korea National Emergency Medical  Center in 2014, a total of 26 208 patients visited emergen­ cy departments due to myocardial infarction and 430 pa­ tients died. A total of 91 924 stroke patients visited emergen­ cy departments due to stroke and 451 patients died in 2013  ( http://www.nemc.or.kr ). These diseases cause death and dis­ ability, creating burdens for patients, their families, society,  and the world [3].  

Therefore, there have been many attempts to predict or pre­ vent these diseases. C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine in  serum are used to predict coronary heart disease risk [38]. Red  blood cell distribution width and calcium score can be used  to assess cardiovascular event risk stratification and preven­ tion [39]. Some authors developed risk scoring system for pre­ diction of atypical symptom presentation in acute myocardial  infarction patients [40]. Increase in the systemic inflammato­ ry marker pro calc it on in is related to no-reflow after primary  percutaneous coronary intervention in ST-elevation myocardial  infarction patients [41]. He mor heo logical abnormalities, poor  glycemic control, and low HDL cholesterol are used as mark­ ers and predictors for major adverse cardiovascular events  and coronary heart disease in outpatients [42]. The ankle-bra­ chial index is useful in predicting acute ischemic stroke [43].  

Recently, many studies have reported the genetic contribution  to predict or prevent these diseases. Several studies showed  the genetic contribution to inflammatory and hemostatic

biomarkers in ischemic stroke patients [44].  CYP2C19  gene  polymorphisms are associated with long-term recurrent risk  of ischemic stroke [45]. Peroxisome pro life rat or-activated re­ ceptors could be a protective factor for ischemic stroke in the  

Chinese Han population [46]. A previous study showed that  genetic factors are associated with age at stroke onset and  sex [47]. Gene-specific DNA methyl ation profiles and LINE-1  hypo methyl ation are associated with myocardial infarction

significantly associated with thrombosis in children [52] and  increased risk of ischemic stroke [53].  

Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to examine the  possible association between IL-6 rs1800795 polymorphism  and ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction risks. However,  we found no statistically significant association between the  IL-6 rs1800795 polymorphism and ischemic stroke or myocar­ dial infarction risks in any models.  

Inflammatory cytokines in arterial lesions plays various roles,  including plaque formation and progression and vessel throm­ bosis [50]. Cytokines produce adhesion molecules, matrix me­ tall o protein as es, and reactive oxygen species and induce the  expression of the messenger cytokine IL-6, which causes the  release of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and plasminogen ac­ tivator inhibitor-1. These lead to at hero thrombosis, which is  the proximate cause of arterial thrombosis [51]. The genotype  of IL-6 is also involved in this process. The IL-6 genotype was  

In the present study, we collected previous studies on isch­ emic stroke or myocardial infarction and IL-6 polymorphism  and could not find any associations. Our results agree with a

infarction. However, we could not show any statistical signifi­ cance in the models. It appears that IL-6 rs1800795 is not as­ sociated with ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction risk.  Further studies including clinical features are needed to clar­ ify the possible relationship between IL-6 rs1800795 poly­ morphism and the development of ischemic stroke or myo­ cardial infarction.  

previous meta-analysis in 2012, which reported a significant as­ sociation between IL-6 gene  $\cdot174\,\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{C}$   polymorphism and myo­ cardial infarction risk in Asians but not in whites [54]. As there  were few studies on Asians, we included only studies on whites  and found no association. A previous study showed that pro-in­ flammatory and pro thr ombo tic polymorphisms, including IL-6,  were not associated with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke [55].

None.  

It is clear that IL-6 plays an important role in the initiation  of thrombosis, resulting in ischemic stroke or myocardial
