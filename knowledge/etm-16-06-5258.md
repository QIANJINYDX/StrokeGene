Abstract.  Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play an  important role in our susceptibility to disease, the severity  of illness and the way our body responds to treatment. This  study evaluated the impact of three polymorphisms on the  susceptibility and functional outcome of ischemic stroke (IS).  Three hundred and eight patients and 300 healthy volunteers  were enrolled. Polymorphisms of  NOX4  rs11018628,  MTHFR rs1801133 and  NEIL3  rs12645561 were detected in both  groups. Smoking   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.001)$  , drinking   $(\mathrm{P<}0.001)$  , hyperten­ sion   $(\mathrm{P<}0.001)$   and diabetes   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.006})$  ), as traditional vascular  risk factors for IS, were confirmed in our study. Logistic  regression analyses with adjustment for age, sex, smoking,  drinking, diabetes, hypertension and total cholesterol  showed that the variant genotypes of  NOX4  rs11018628 were  associated with a significantly decreased risk (Dominant  model:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.32$  ,   $95\%$   CI=0.22-0.48,   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001\$   and a better  short-term recovery of IS (Dominant model:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.57$  ,   $95\%$  CI=0.35-0.95,   $\mathrm{P{=}}0.029$  ). This study demonstrates that the  NOX4  rs11018628 SNP is associated with decreased risk  in developing IS and better short-term recovery of patients.  This suggests that the genetic variant of  NOX4  rs11018628  may contribute to the etiology of IS.  

# Introduction  

Stroke is one of the most common causes of mortality and  disability in the elderly population worldwide. In China, the  annual stroke mortality rate is approximately 157 per 100,000,  which is the leading cause of death and adult disability (1). In  the clinic, stroke is presented in two major forms: ischemic  stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS), of which the former  accounts for  $80\%$   of stroke patients (2). The cost of initial care,  rehabilitation, and follow-up care of lasting disabilities is a  huge burden to the healthcare system. It is reported that each  stroke patient costs the US healthcare system approximately  US\$140,048 (3).  

There are various risk factors for IS, including hypertension,  poor diet, smoking, lack of exercise, obesity, hyper c holes­ terolemia, and diabetes (4). Besides, evidence from animal,  clinical and epidemiological studies suggests that genetic  factors also play an important role in stroke susceptibility  and prognosis (5,6). There are several causes contributing to  the genetic variations in humans, of which single-nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) play a vital role. An SNP could alter  the DNA in the genome by exchanging one single base pair for  another, thus influencing the expression of the gene (7). SNPs  express differences in our susceptibility to disease, the severity  of illness and the way our body responds to treatment (8).  Evidence from previous studies has shown the association  between several SNPs and IS (9-12).  

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are byproducts of cell  metabolism, which results in significant damage to DNA  structures. The brain needs a strong system to repair the DNA  structure damaged by ROS. Our previous study reported that  the DNA repair system pathway gene XRCC1 is associated  with susceptibility and short-term recovery of IS (11). We  assumed that genetic variants affecting the DNA damage and  repair system may influence the clinical outcome following  IS. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is a member of the family of  NADPH oxidases, containing a catalytic NOX subunit that  transfers electrons from NADPH to oxygen, thereby forming  ROS. Methylene tetra hydro folate reductase (MTHFR) is  the key enzyme involved in plasma homo cyst eine (tHcy)  metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of 5, 10-methyl­ tetra hydro folate to 5-methyl tetra hydro folate, a methyl donor  during tHcy re methyl ation. tHcy is a crucial intermediate in  methionine metabolism and causes excessive production of  reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, NOX4 and MTHFR  are key enzymes involved in ROS producing. NEIL3 belongs  to a class of DNA gly cosy las es that recognizes oxidized  DNA bases, which is the first step of base excision repair  pathway. NEIL3 plays an important role in repairing the ROS  induced DNA damage. In this study, we further investigated  the contribution of three SNPs referring to the damage and  repair system,  NOX4  rs11018628,  MTHFR  rs1801133 and  NEIL3  rs12645561, to the development of stroke and outcome  of ischemia.  

# Materials and methods  

Study subjects.  In this study, we enrolled 308  patients  (180 males and 128 females) diagnosed with IS from the  Department of Neurology, The Affiliated Jiangyin People's  Hospital of Southeast University Medical College (Wuxi,  China) and the Department of Neurology, Huai'an First  People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University (Huai'an,  China). In addition, 300 healthy volunteers were recruited  from The Affiliated Jiangyin People's Hospital of Southeast  University Medical College as the case groups, during the  same period, however, they were not age-matched samples.  After consulting Pub-med, the frequency of gene mutations in  the population was assumed to be   $15\%$  . The odds ratio OR was  0.4, the two‑sided test   $\upalpha$   was 0.05, and the power of   $\mathsf{1-\beta}$   was   $90\%$  . The minimum sample size of the case and control groups  was estimated to be 285 cases by PASS software. Taking into  account factors such as loss of follow-up and single-gene  weak effects, this study planned to prepare 300 samples per  group. Diagnosis of patients with IS was established clinically  and confirmed by using X-ray computed tomography and/or  magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain, according  to the World Health Organization criteria  (13). We also  recruited 300 healthy volunteers from the Affiliated Jiangyin  People's Hospital of Southeast University Medical College  during the same period of time. Conventional clinical hema­ tology, biochemistry and immunology examinations were  conducted. Patients with atypical symptoms, including brain  trauma, intra cranial hemorrhage, post-seizure palsy, vascular  malformations, metabolic disorders (except diabetes mellitus),  infections, autoimmune diseases, blood diseases, cancer and  severe chronic diseases (e.g., liver and kidney dysfunction)  were excluded.  

This study was approved by the Local Ethics Association  and the Ethics Committee of The Affiliated Jiangyin People's  Hospital of Southeast University Medical College and each  participant signed a written informed consent (Project identi­ fication code: 2016-011).  

Data collection.  All case and control individuals filled out a  study questionnaire, which included demographic information,  medical history (hypertension or diabetes mellitus), alcohol  consumption, daily cigarette smoking, obesity, and param­ eters of hypercholesterolemia. Hypertension was defined  as blood pressure (BP)   ${>}140/90\ \mathrm{mmHg}$   (average of three  independent measures) or the use of anti hypertensive drugs.  Specially, in the diabetic subjects hypertension was defined as   $\mathrm{BP{>}130/85~m m H g}$   (average of three independent measures)  or the use of anti hypertensive drugs. Diabetes mellitus  was defined as fasting glucose level   ${\ge}7.0\,\mathrm{\mmol/l}$   and/or   $\geq\!11.1\ \mathrm{mmol}/1\ 2\ \mathrm{h}$   after oral glucose challenge, or receiving

anti diabetic drugs. Subjects were considered as smokers if they  smoked  ${>}10$   cigarettes per day for five years, and as drinkers if  they drank  ${>}50~\mathrm{ml}$   alcoholic beverages per day for five years.  Subjects with body mass index (  $\mathrm{BMI}){\geq}25\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$   were conside-red as overweight. The National Institutes of Health Stroke  Scale (NIHSS) score and FIM instrument score (14) were used  to quantify stroke severity and functional independence of  patients at the time of presentation and discharge. The FIM  instrument is an 18-item scale, which measures independence  involved in feeding, grooming, dressing, toileting, mobility,  and cognition. Subjects are scored from 7 (totally independent)  to 1 (totally dependent) on each item, with a score of 126 indi­ cating total functional independence. The NIHSS scale is  composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability  between 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates  normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is  indicative of some level of impairment.  

SNP selection and DNA extraction and genotyping.  Based on  information in the NCBI SNP database and the International  HapMap project data for the Han Chinese population, the  polymorphisms of  NOX4  rs11018628,  MTHFR  rs1801133  and  NEIL3  rs12645561 were selected. Blood samples were  collected after a   $12\textrm{h}$   overnight fasting period and then sepa­ rated into serum, red blood cells, and buffy coat. Total DNA  from leukocytes was extracted using the salt fractionation  method according to a standard protocol (15). DNA samples  were subjected to DNA genotyping using the TaqMan SNP  Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher  Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Briefly, each geno­ typing assay contained one pair of primers and one pair of  probes (Table I). The PCR conditions were   $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $2~\mathrm{min}$  ,   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\ \mathrm{min}$   followed by 45 cycles of   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 15 sec and   $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\;\mathrm{{min}}$  . The genotyping results were calculated by the

allelic discrimination mode of the SDS 2.3 software package  (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and a   $100\%$   concordance was achieved.  

Statistical analysis.  All statistical analyses were performed  with Stata/SE (V.12.0 for Windows; StataCorp LP, College  Station, TX, USA). Demographic data were compared using  the two-sample t-test and Chi-square   $(\upchi^{2})$   test. The association  of different genotypes with IS severity and short-term recovery  and functional outcome were evaluated by calculation of the  odds ratio (OR) and  $95\%$   confidence intervals   $95\%$   CI) using  univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. All  statistical analyses were two-sided and  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$   was considered  statistically significant.  

# Results  

Characteristics of participants.  Characteristics of patients  with IS and healthy controls are shown in Table II. Chi-square  test showed that the patient group had higher proportion of  males compared to the control group (58.6 vs.  $46\%$  ,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.002)$  .  Compared with the healthy controls, IS patients were more  likely to smoke cigarettes   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.001)$  , drink alcoholic bever­ ages   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.001)$  , have diabetes   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.006})$  ) and hypertension   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.001)$  . The IS patients also showed a trend toward  having higher serum triglyceride concentrations. However,  our study failed to identify serum total cholesterol, serum  HDL-C, serum LDL-C concentration or BMI as risk factors  for IS (Table II). These observations confirm the role of  smoking, drinking, hypertension and diabetes as traditional  vascular risk factors for IS.  

Association of SNP genotypes with IS susceptibility.  The  distributions of the three genotype frequencies in patients and  controls are presented in Table III. A significantly different  distribution of  NOX4  rs11018628 was observed between the  patient and control group in our study. The other two SNPs  showed no significantly different distributions. Logistic  regression analyses with adjustment for age, sex, smoking,  drinking, diabetes, hypertension and total cholesterol revealed  that the variant genotypes of  NOX4  rs11018628 were associated  with a significantly decreased risk of IS (Dominant model:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.32$  ,  $95\%$   CI=0.22-0.48,  $\mathrm{P{<}0.001}$  ). Next we compared the  known allele frequency of each SNP in the general population  and the control group of this study. After consulting the SNP  database of NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), we  confirmed that the frequency of TT/TC/CC on rs1801133,  among Hap Map-HCB population, were 0.30, 0.42 and 0.28,  respectively, which is close to that of 0.37, 0.46 and 0.18 among  our control group. The situation of rs12645561 and rs11018628  is similar to the above.  

Association of NOX4 rs11018628 polymorphism with IS severity,  short-term recovery and functional outcome.  Considering  the relationship of the  NOX4  rs11018628 polymorphism to IS  susceptibility, we next examined its contribution to IS severity  and short-term recovery. IS severity was determined by  admission NIHSS score and short-term recovery was defined  as change of NIHSS score from admission to discharging  ( ∆ NIHSS). As NIHSS score and  ∆ NIHSS score were not  skewed and could not be transformed to normal distribution,  they were dic hot omi zed for logistic regression analysis.  According to previous studies (10,11,16), the cut-off of NIHSS  score for mild and severe IS was set between 6 and 7. For clini-cal improvement and no change or deterioration, the cut-off  of   $\Delta\mathrm{NISTHS}$   score was set at 0. Logistic regression analyses  with adjustment for age, sex, smoking, drinking, diabetes,  hypertension and total cholesterol indicated that the rs11018628  TC/CC genotype was associated with a better short-term  recovery (Dominant model:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.57$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.35{-}0.95$  ,   $\mathrm{P{=}}0.029$  ). However, no significant association between  rs11018628 and initial IS severity was observed. We also  investigated associations of rs1801133 and rs12645561 with  IS severity and short-term recovery. As shown in Table IV,  rs1801133 and rs12645561 showed no significant associations  with IS severity and short-term recovery. Finally, we investigated

whether there was a difference in functional outcome between  patients harboring the rs11018628 TT and TC/CC genotypes.  The short‑term functional outcome was defined as the change  of FIM scores from admission to discharging ( ∆ FIM). As  presented in Fig. 1, there was no significant difference in terms  of  ∆ FIM score between the two groups   $_{\mathrm{(P>0.05)}}$   (Table IV).  

# Discussion  

In the current study, we analyzed the polymorphism of  NOX4  rs11018628,  MTHFR  rs1801133 and  NEIL3  rs12645561 in  blood samples obtained from IS patients vs. healthy controls  and then associated them with IS risk and outcome in a Chinese  Han population. We found that smoking, drinking, diabetes  and hypertension were associated with an increased risk of IS.  Moreover, we found that  NOX4  rs11018628 TC and CC geno­ types were associated with decreased risk of IS compared with  the TT genotype. In addition, patients harboring rs11018628  TC/CC genotype also had a better short-term recovery.  However,  MTHFR  rs1801133 and  NEIL3  rs12645561 showed  no significant association with IS susceptibility, severity and  short-term recovery.  

It is interesting that there is significant association of  NOX4 rs11018628 with change of NIHSS score, but not with FIM  score change and initial NIHSS score. The initial NIHSS score  represents the level of initial neurogical impairment. However,  patients with a milder initial neurogical impairment may not  have a better short-term recovery, as determined by change of  NIHSS score. Thus,  NOX4  rs11018628 may be associated with  the change of NIHSS score while not with the initial NIHSS  score. The FIM and NIHSS scores evaluate different aspects of  patients. The FIM instrument puts emphasis on the functional  outcome while NIHSS score puts emphasis on the neurogical  deficits. For example, an IS patient may have a certain degree of  strength recovery of his hand. However, this extent of strength  recovery may not be strong enough to make his hand grasp a  cup. Thus, this patient would only have an NIHSS score change  while FIM score would show no improvement. NADPH oxidase  4 (NOX4) is a member of the family of NADPH oxidases,  which are multi component protein complexes containing a  catalytic NOX subunit that transfers electrons from NADPH to  oxygen, thereby forming ROS (17). Reactive oxygen species are  byproducts of the normal cell metabolism of oxygen. The brain  is particularly vulnerable to ROS owning to its high oxygen

consumption and low capacity of oxidative clearance (18). The  overload of ROS could cause oxidative stress, which has been  suggested as a key underlying mechanism of IS (19).  

Mounting evidence has demonstrated that the NOX family  is deeply associated with IS (20-23). Of all the five NOX  isoforms, NOX4 is expressed in the central nervous system,  including intra cranial vessels and neuronal tissues  (24).  Therefore, NOX4 is most likely relevant in IS. Several studies  have reported that the mRNA level of NOX4 is increased after  middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (25,26). Besides,  a study conducted by Klein sch nitz  et al  observed that NOX4  knock-out mice had smaller infarcts, lower mortality rates and  neurological deficit scores at seven days after MCAO (22).  NOX4 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for  IS (23). To the best of our knowledge, this study first showed  that  NOX4  rs11018628 TC and CC genotypes were associated  with better short-term recovery of IS. Our study may provide  information beneficial for further investigation of potential  candidates for stroke therapy.  

There are some limitations to this study. The relatively  small sample size may limit our ability to detect the positive  relationship between the SNPs and IS. Therefore, the negative  findings of  MTHFR  rs1801133 and  NEIL3  rs12645561 should  be taken into consideration with caution. Further replication  studies of the relation of these SNPs in independent and large  subject panels should be performed. Besides, our findings also  need to be further independently verified in different ethnic  populations.  

In summary, this study showed that smoking, drinking,  hypertension and diabetes were associated with increased risk  of IS. Furthermore, the genetic variant of  NOX4  rs11018628  was associated with a decreased risk and better short-term  recovery of IS. However, further studies are needed to eluci­ date the underlying mechanism.
