BACKGROUND :  Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in inflammation-related genes have been linked to an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Most of these SNP results have not been replicated, however, and metaanalyses of the effects of inflammation-related genes are rare. We investigated 49 SNPs in 34 genes previously reported to be related to inflammation in our study. We tested 459 patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and 459 controls individually matched by sex and age.  

METHODS :  We studied genetic variation by PCR analysis and subsequent hybridization to linear arrays of sequence-specific oli go nucleotides. We used univariate conditional logistic regression analysis to test for associations of conventional vascular risk factors and the SNPs with stroke. Variables showing significant differences   $\textstyle P<0.05\$  ) between cases and controls were included in a multivariate model. ROC curves were plotted to assess the contribution of genetic variation to stroke risk in addition to that of conventional risk factors.  

RESULTS :  Univariate regression analysis revealed  $3\;\mathrm{{SNPs}}$  with significant allelic differences between patients and controls, which fulfilled the criteria for further analysis. Only one of these SNPs, the  C5  (complement component 5)  $2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   variant (rs17611), remained significant after the multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.585;  $P=0.0037$  ). ROC curve analysis revealed no contribu- tion of this genetic variation to stroke risk.  

CONCLUSIONS :  We found evidence for an association of the  $2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   polymorphism in the  C5  gene with the risk for ischemic stroke. Our data suggest that the    $C5$  gene particularly influences the risk for patients with micro an gi opa thy.  $\copyright$   2008 American Association for Clinical Chemistry  

Inflammatory mechanisms are implicated at all stages of the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke. The inflamma- tory response has been linked to the development of at hero sclerotic lesions    $(l\,)$   in the carotid arteries or the aorta, which are causative in   $30\%$   of ischemic strokes (2) . Both humoral inflammation and cellular inflammatory processes are also involved in the response to injury in acute ischemic stroke  (3) . Furthermore, markers of inflammation are associated with many classic vascular risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyper lipid emi a  (4) .  

Some studies have linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms   $\ensuremath{\left(\mathrm{SNR}\right)}^{6}$    in inflammation-related genes to an increased risk of ischemic stroke. In most cases, however, these results have not been replicated, and meta analyses of the relationship of inflammationrelated genes to stroke risk are rare  (5) .  

We investigated 49 SNPs in 34 genes that had previously been associated with inflammatory diseases and evaluated their contribution to the risk of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack in a large cohort of consecutive patients and controls individually matched by sex and age.  

# Patients, Materials, and Methods  

PATIENTS AND CONTROL INDIVIDUALS The study included randomly selected patients who had experienced acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and had been documented in the Vienna Stroke Registry    $(6,7)$  . The diagnosis had been established clinically  (8) , and all patients had undergone cranial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging examinations. The patients were carefully documented according to a standardized protocol  (6)  with respect to conventional risk factors, medical history, laboratory and technical investigations, and classification of the cerebro vascular event, including classification of the subtype according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria  (6)  and measurement of stroke severity according to validated scales. We excluded both patients with hemorrhagic stroke, sinus thrombosis, or rare causes of stroke (e.g., arterial dissection) and patients from whom written informed consent could not be obtained.  

Patients were individually matched to controls by sex and age   $\pm3$   years; the difference was 4 years in 3 cases and 5 years in 1 case). The control individuals were participants in an official health service program of the City of Vienna and came from the same geographic region. They were free of clinically manifested vascular disease and reported an absence of vascular disease in first-degree relatives.  

Written informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all individuals. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee.  

# DEFINITIONS  

Arterial hypertension was defined as a history of arterial hypertension, blood pressure values  ${>}140/90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$  (measured in patients 1 week after the qualifying event), or use of anti hypertensive medication. Presence of diabetes mellitus was defined by fasting blood glucose concentrations  ${>}6.94\;\mathrm{mmol/L},$  , a history of diabetes, or treatment with anti diabetes medication. Initial blood glucose concentrations were measured at the time of admission, and the fasting blood glucose concent rations were generally first measured on the first workday after admission. Hyper lipid emi a was defined as a fasting total serum cholesterol concentration  ${>}5.18\ \mathrm{mmol/L},$   a history of hyper lipid emi a, or use of lipid-lowering medication.  

# GENOTYPING  

Blood was collected by veni puncture into citratecontaining tubes and frozen at  $-20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   within  $^{3-5\mathrm{~h~}}$  ® after sampling. DNA was extracted with the Puregene DNA-isolation kit (Qiagen/Gentra Systems). We used a PCR-based inflammatory-marker panel developed by Roche Molecular Systems to genotype DNA samples (see Table 1 in the Data Supplement that accompanies the online version of this article at http://www. clinchem.org/content/vol55/issue1; for prevalence, see Table 2 in the online Data Supplement), essentially as previously described  (9) . The SNPs on the strip system represent a selection of genetic variants, essentially all of which had been associated with inflammatory diseases before the development of the strips. In brief, a multiplex pool of bio tiny late d primer pairs was used to amplify genomic DNA. The amplified fragments in each PCR-product pool were hybridized to sequencespecific oli go nucleotide probes that had been immobilized in a linear array on nylon membranes. Hybridization was detected color i metrically. The linear arrays were then scanned on a flatbed imager, and proprietary software from Roche Molecular Systems was used to analyze the images and assign genotypes. Images were evaluated independently by 2 individuals who had been blinded to the clinical data.  

# STATISTICAL METHODS  

We used the program at http://kursus.kvl.dk/shares/ vetgen/Popgen/genetik/applets/kitest.htm to test geno- type frequencies for conformity to the Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium.  

To investigate the influence of each polymorphism (dominant and recessive models) and conventional risk factors (hypertension, hyper lipid emi a, diabetes, and smoking), we carried out univariate conditional logistic regression analyses after controlling for the matching variable of age. In this analysis, the test statistics conform to a  $\chi^{2}$    distribution with 1 degree of freedom. Odds ratios (ORs),  $95\%$   CIs, and  $P$   values were calculated.  

Variables showing statistically significant   $\mathit{\Delta}_{P}<$  0.05) differences between patients and controls were further analyzed in a stepwise multiple conditional logistic regression model. Additional criteria for the inclusion of SNPs in the multivariate analysis were no deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, a minor-allele frequency of  ${>}20\%$  , or a variant homozygote frequency of  ${>}5\%$  .  

The threshold to enter or stay in the model was set to  $P=0.05$  . We chose this “liberal” approach to minimize false-negative associations, because the estimated effect of a single SNP on polygenic stroke is expected to be modest.  

We graphed ROC curves to explore the relationship between the sensitivity and the specificity of a clinical test for all possible cutoff points.  

We plotted 2 ROC curves, one for risk factors only and one for the resulting model of risk factors and genetic variants, and used a non parametric approach to compare the areas under the 2 ROC curves  (10) .  

To estimate power, we assumed that the case and control groups were independent   $\chi^{2}$    test with equal group sizes). A  $\chi^{2}$    test with a 0.05 2-sided significance level would have an  $85\%$   power to distinguish a genotype occurring at a frequency of 0.1 from one occurring at 0.17 (patients vs controls) for a group sample size of 460 each (OR, 1.8). With a frequency of 0.3 for any genotype in the patient group and 0.4 in the control group, we reached  $87\%$   power with a sample size of 460 in each group (OR, 1.6).  

The data were analyzed with SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute), and R, version 2.6.  

# Results  

We genotyped 49 inflammation-related SNPs for 459 stroke patients and 459 healthy control individuals (see Table 1 in the online Data Supplement). The baseline characteristics of the patients and controls are summarized in Table 1. Of the 49 SNPs, 29 featured minorallele frequencies of  ${<}20\%$  . Five SNPs located in the  $I L6^{7}$    [interleukin 6 (interferon, beta 2)],  C5  (complement component 5),  ADRB2  (adrenergic, beta-2-, receptor, surface),  IL9  (interleukin 9), and  CXCL12 [chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (stromal cellderived factor 1); formerly  SDF1 ] genes showed allelic differences between patients and controls that were statistically significant (see Table 3 in the online Data Supplement) in the recessive univariate model, in addition to the risk factors of smoking, hyper lipid emi a, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Three SNPs located in the  ADRB2 ,  TGFB1  (transforming growth factor, beta 1), and  NOS2A  (nitric oxide synthase 2, inducible A) genes showed a statistically significant frequency difference in the dominant model.  

The  $I L9\ 4244\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}$   and  CXCL12    $880\mathrm{G}\!>\!\mathrm{A}$   SNPs were excluded from further analysis because the genotype frequencies deviated from the Hardy–Weinburg equilibrium in the controls   $\left.P<0.001\right.$  ). Two SNPs (in NOS2A  and  TGFB1 ) were statistically significant   $|P<$  0.05) in a dominant model, but the recessive and dominant models for the SNPs for these 2 genes showed in congruent associations with stroke: In the dominant model, both the  NOS2A  and  TGFB1  variants appeared to confer a reduction in risk, whereas they seemed to confer an increased risk in the recessive model (see Table 3 in the online Data Supplement). Therefore, these 2 SNPs were excluded from further analysis.  

The remaining 3 SNPs (in the  IL6 ,  C5 , and  ADRB2 genes) were included in a stepwise conditional logistic regression analysis along with the vascular risk factors. Besides smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and

a  NS, not statistically significant.  

hyper lipid emi a, only the    $C5\;\;2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   variant remained significant (OR, 0.585;  $95\%$   CI, 0.41–0.84;  $P=$  0.0037) (Table 2). Allowing interaction between the C5  variant and the vascular risk factors did not change the results (data not shown). The  $C5\,2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   variant showed no clear contribution to risk in addition to that of the conventional vascular risk factors, and the difference in the areas under the ROC curves was not significant (0.760 vs 0.766;  $P=0.300$  ) (Fig. 1).  

A subgroup analysis of patients with macroangiopathy  $\mathrm{(n=86)}$  ),card i oem boli c stroke  $\mathrm{{(n=75}}$  ),microangiopathy   $\mathrm{(n=96}$  ), and stroke of unknown etiology  $\mathrm{(n=200)}$  ) showed that the G allele of the  $C5\,2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$  SNP conferred an OR of 0.274   $[95\%$   CI, 0.10–0.96;  $P\,=\,0.04265$  ) for lacunar stroke (see Table 4C in the online Data Supplement).  

We identified statistically significant associations with SNPs in the macro an gi opa thy and microangiopathy groups, as well as in the group of patients with unknown etiology: in the macro an gi opa thy group,  CCR5 [chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5] SNP   $59029\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  (OR, 0.221;  $95\%$   CI, 0.07–0.7;  $P=0.0105$  ) and  CCL11 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 11; formerly  SCYA11 ] SNP   $361\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   (OR, 6.19;   $95\%$   CI, 1.81–20.8;  $P~=$

No genetic variant was associated with the risk for card i oem boli c stroke (see Table 4, A–D, in the online Data Supplement).  

# Discussion  

We analyzed the association of 49 SNPs in genes related to inflammatory diseases with stroke risk in a Caucasian population. After a multivariate analysis con- trolling for generally accepted vascular risk factors, we found a statistically significant association between the  $2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   polymorphism in the  $C5$   gene and the risk of ischemic stroke.  

The complement system consists of a family of plasma proteins that mediate op so niz ation and induce inflammation. C5 has a central role in the complement cascade. Two cleavage products are generated after cleavage by C5 convertase. C5b interacts with other complement proteins to form the membrane attack complex, which consists of a lytic pore that leaks the intracellular contents. C5a, the smaller fragment, is a potent inflammatory molecule. Experimental studies have shown that C5a and the membrane attack complex directly stimulate adhesion molecule production and the generation of chemokines by endo the li al cells, thereby promoting pro inflammatory mechanisms at several cellular levels  (11) .  

A previous study found increased serum concentrations of C5 in individuals with the 2416AA homozygous genotype  (12) . The same study showed higher stages of fibrosis in hepatitis C patients who were homozygous carriers of the A allele. In addition, increased C5 concentrations have recently been associated with increased cardiovascular risk in patients with atherosclerosis  (13) . Our findings of an apparently lower risk for ischemic cerebro vascular events among carriers of the GG genotype are consistent with these data. Through C5a and C5b, C5 may represent a modifier of chronic inflammatory diseases, and carriers of the AA genotype may be at higher risk.  

Berger et al. recently carried out a study with the same genotyping system as ours and reported that the  $2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   polymorphism in the C5 gene was not associated with the risk of ischemic stroke  (14) . These invest i gators analyzed the contribution of 106 SNPs in 63 candidate genes in a study of 2 large independent German cohorts, the smaller of which served as the replication cohort. The differences in findings between our study and the study of the German patients could be due to clinical differences in the patient populations. Ethnic differences could also be responsible, even in central Europe. In addition, the German study did not include smoking status, and certain SNPs could represent significant risk factors, depending on the smoking status. We therefore searched for an interaction of the  $C5\,2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   variant with smoking but found no such effect (data not shown). Visualization of our results with ROC curves showed little if any contribution of the single  $C5\,\mathrm{SNP}$   to stroke risk in addition to the classic risk factors.  

In the subgroup analysis, the  C5  variant was associated with lacunar stroke. Importantly, the presence of the G allele as a risk factor for lacunar stroke showed an OR similar to what we have also observed for the total stroke population. So far, only a few replicable associations of SNPs with the risk of cerebral microangiopathy have been reported: associations with genes involved in endo the li al function, including those regulating the renin–angiotensin system and endo the li al nitric oxide  (15) . Recently, a large-scale genetic epidemiologic study showed that SNPs in the  PRKCH  (protein kinase C eta) gene were significantly associated with lacunar infarction  (16) . One small study investigated the influence of one candidate inflammatorygene variant (the    $I L6\ 987\mathrm{G{>}C}$   polymorphism) on stroke risk and found an association with lacunar stroke  (17) . Our study is the first to report an association between the    $C5\ 2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   variant and lacunar stroke. We also detected associations of other SNPs with risk in other subgroups of stroke; however, because of the smaller sample sizes of these subgroups, some of the results show very wide CIs. Importantly, only the  $C5\,2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   variant remained significantly associated with stroke risk in the entire patient population; however, one cannot rule out the possibility that any one of the other variants plays a role in etiologic subgroups or under specific clinical situations.  

# LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY  

The impact of individual genetic variants in stroke is probably small  (18) , and given the limited sample size, we cannot exclude the possibility that some small effects did not reach statistical significance. The  C5  $2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   SNP had a minor-allele frequency of 0.42 (A allele).  

Importantly, we did not perform a formal Bonferroni adjustment for multiplicity in the stepwise multiple regression analysis because we wanted to minimize false-negative results. After Bonferroni adjustment,  C5  would not have remained significant.  

In conclusion, our analysis of an association of 49 SNPs in 34 inflammation-related genes with the risk of ischemic stroke indicates a small but statistically significant effect of the  $2416\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   SNP in the  C5  gene. The GG genotype was associated with a lower risk for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack in our population, specifically in patients with lacunar stroke. This observation underlines the impact of inflammatory mechanisms related to the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke. We encourage larger studies and meta analyses of similar patient cohorts to confirm our findings.
