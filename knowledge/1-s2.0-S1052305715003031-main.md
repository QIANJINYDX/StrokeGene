Background:  Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multi factorial disease that displays a strong genetic predisposition. However, the genetic architecture of IS has yet to be fully elucidated. It was hypothesized that epistasis between genes in multiple atherothrombotic pathways may play a vital role in determining the susceptibility to IS. The aim of the present study was to investigate the contributions of the hypothesized genetic factors to IS and the interactions between these genetic factors in a Chinese population.  Methods:  In this study, 351 cases with IS and 417 control subjects from a Chinese population were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 genes hypothesized to be involved in atherosclerosis, coagulation, and related pathways. We examined SNP main effects and epistatic interactions between these polymorphic loci.  Results:  rs710446 of the  KNG1  gene was associated with IS susceptibility based on an additive genetic model (rs710446:  $P=.012;$  ; odds ratio [OR], 1.247;  $95\%$   conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.050-1.481) after adjusting for covariates. Furthermore, an epistatic interaction between the  ALOX5AP, THBD , and KNG1  gene was also identiﬁed in association with stroke susceptibility   $(P<.001\$  after 1000 permutations). Based on the chi-squared test, the OR of the high-risk combination of the three-locus model increased the risk of IS by 2.53-fold   $(95\%$   CI, 1.60-4.01;  $\ensuremath{\cal P}\ \ <\ \.0001]$  Conclusions: Our ﬁndings support the association of the epistatic interactions of  ALOX5AP, THBD , and  KNG1  and present novel evidence for the main effect of  KNG1  gene on IS susceptibility, suggesting a modulation of stroke risk by a genetic main effect and gene–gene interactions. Key Words: Ischemic stroke—at hero thrombosis—epistatic interactions— pathogenic pathways—disease-related genetic network.

Ischemic stroke (IS) is the second most common cause of death and the leading cause of long-term disability in adults worldwide. Epidemiologic studies indicate that IS is a multi factorial disease caused by conventional risk factors and genetic predisposition.   However, unlike well-established conventional risk factors, the genetic architecture of IS has yet to be completely elucidated. As a complex disease displaying heterogeneous etiology, the primary pathogen es is of IS differs according to race and ethnicity: emboli originating from the heart and extra cranial large arteries are common in Western populations, whereas intra cranial atherosclerosis, which is associated with lacunae and with large infarcts, is more prevalent in Asian populations, especially in China.  

Because a the roth rom bot ic events constitute the most common causative mechanism of IS in China,   it is imperative to elucidate the underlying genetic architecture of IS in the Chinese Han population.  

In the past decade, many candidate gene studies focusing on genes that are involved in processes related to at hero thrombosis have identiﬁed the following additional genes and novel pathways that are associated with IS. (1) Oxidative stress genes: accumulating evidence has shown that oxidative stress, which results from an imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants and the consequent excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a pivotal role in the pathogen es is of IS. Variations in oxidative stress–related genes such as  ALOX5AP ,  ALOX5 ,  GPX3 , and  Catalase  may inﬂuence the susceptibility to IS.   (2) The kallikrein–kinin system (KKS): evidence from an animal model (spontaneously hypertensive stroke–prone rat) indicates that not only hypertension and vascular remodeling but also stroke risk is partially modulated by the KKS.   Although a recent meta-analysis conﬁrmed the association between a polymorphism of the  ACE  gene and IS in Asian populations,   the contribution of other genes in the KKS to IS remains intriguing. (3) The protein C anticoagulant pathway: the protein C anticoagulant pathway maintains the ﬂuidity of circulation, prevents thrombosis, and plays important roles in the path o physiology of vascular disease. Previous studies provided evidence that the THBD ,  F5 , and  PROS1  genes in the protein C anticoagulant pathway contribute to the risk of IS. (4) Obesity-related genes: it is proved that overweight and obesity are independent risk factors for IS.   A fat mass and obesity-associated gene ( MC4R ) was identiﬁed in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS).   Accumulating evidence indicates the involvement of  MC4R gene in conditions such as metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis, thus emphasizing the need to determine the contribution of this obesity-related gene to IS susceptibility. Ultimately, the application of GWAS to a range of multi factorial IS has led to the ident i cation of novel disease genes that are not obvious candidates, such as HDAC9  for IS related to large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), and  PITX2  and  ZFHX3  for card i oem boli c stroke. However, some of these associations were not validated in subsequent studies. Because of this failure to replicate the effects of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across studies, the contribution of these genetic factors to stroke has yet to be established.  

Epistatic (gene–gene) interactions may be a ubiquitous primary component of the genetic architecture of common human diseases,   including IS. Currently, GWASs and most candidate gene case–control studies have primarily focused on a single locus that contributes to stroke; however, the contributions of gene–gene interactions to the risk of stroke may explain the discrepancies across studies.   Common variants involved in disease risk are likely to occur in or near genes in multiple pathways.   Liu et   ${\mathsf{a l}}^{20}$    proposed that epistatic interaction between genes in multiple pathogenic pathways and disease-related genetic networks may play a vital role in determining the susceptibility of complex diseases. Therefore, describing gene–gene interactions in the biological frameworks (from pathogenic pathways to disease-related genetic networks) is crucial for characterizing certain stroke-related pathogen es is, particularly when each involved gene only exerts a minor marginal effect. To begin to explore the genetic architecture of IS in the Chinese Han population, we identiﬁed SNPs in 12 candidate genes that have been previously determined to play a role in processes related to at hero thrombosis (including genes in the KKS, the oxidative stress system, the protein C anticoagulant pathway, the obesity gene, and the latest GWAS ﬁndings). We use a systematic approach that simultaneously investigates the contributions of these genetic factors (as main effects or as part of interactions). The aim of the current study was to investigate the contributions of the hypothesized genetic factors to IS susceptibility and the interactions between these genetic factors in the Chinese Han population.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Study Population  

A total of 768 unrelated individuals were recruited for this study: 351 IS patients and 417 healthy controls. All of the subjects originated from the Chinese Han population. The 351 IS patients were prospectively recruited from those admitted to the Stroke Unit of the Department of Neurology at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between June 2011 and July 2012. Each diagnosis of an IS was made based on the results of a neurologic examination using magnetic resonance imaging according to the International Class i cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision. The subtypes of IS were classiﬁed based on the TOAST criteria. Patients with IS related to LAA and lacunar stroke were included. Because acute lacunar strokes are caused by atherosclerosis at the proximal segment of the penetrating arteries or lip oh ya lino tic degeneration of arterioles, they are regarded as evidence of atherosclerosis.   The overlapping pathogen es is of LAA stroke and lacunar stroke enables both disorders to beneﬁt from p harm a co logical prevention strategies against at hero thrombosis,   implying a common pathogenic mechanism and underlying genetic architecture. These 2 conditions were analyzed together in our study. Patients with IS caused by car dio embolism, stroke of other determined causes (SOC) or stroke of undetermined causes (SUC) were excluded. The following baseline charact eris tics and risk factors for cerebro vascular disease were recorded: age, gender, hypertension (treated or systolic blood pressure  $[\mathrm{SBP}]\geq140\,\mathrm{mm\,Hg}$   or diastolic blood pressure   $[\mathrm{DBP}]\,\geq\,90~\mathrm{mm}~\mathrm{Hg})$  ), and diabetes (treated or fasting plasma glucose  $\ge~7.0$  mmol/L or 2-hour post pr an dial plasma glucose or random plasma glucose    $\geq\,11.1\,\,\mathrm{mmol/L}$  ). Quantitative traits, including the levels of body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and blood lipids (including total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides [TGs], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]), were also recorded. Furthermore, lifestyle-based risk factors, including smoking and drinking status, were recorded. A total of 417 controls who had never experienced any stroke were matched with the IS cases with respect to age, sex, and ethnic background. The control subjects reported no history of stroke, hematological disease, other cerebro vascular disease, liver ailment, nephrosis, autoimmune disease, or pregnancy. The protocols of this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and all the participants signed the informed consent.  

# Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Genotyping  

SNPs from 12 genes known or hypothesized to be involved in at hero thrombosis-related processes, including blood pressure regulation, vascular remodeling, oxidative stress, obesity, and anti coagulation, were selected based on several different criteria, including previous publications, non synonymous SNPs,and tagSNPs, were identiﬁed using public databases such as dbSNP ( http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/SNP ). The selected SNPs occurred in genes involved in disease-related pathogenic pathways, spec i call y the oxidative stress system ( ALOX5AP [rs4293222], ALOX5 [rs10900213], GPX1 [rs1050450], GPX3  [rs3828599], and  Catalase  [rs7943316]), the kallikrein–kinin pathway ( KLK1 [rs5517] and KNG1 [rs710446]), the protein C anti coagulation pathway ( THBD [rs1042580, rs3746726], PROS1 [rs8178591], and F5

 [rs6025]), an obesity-related gene ( MC4R  [rs17782313]), and a novel locus found in a GWAS ( HDAC9  [rs2107595]). Peripheral venous blood   $(5\;\mathrm{mL})$  ) was collected from all of the participants, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using standard methods. The genotypes were determined using Sequenom iPLEX assays with allele detection by mass spectroscopy, using Sequenom MassARRAY technology (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) and following the manufacturer’s protocol. The SNP genotyping was performed by laboratory technicians who had no prior knowledge of the subjects’ disease status. The primers for polymerase chain reaction amp li cation and extension reactions were designed using MassARRAY Assay Design Software (Sequenom, San Diego, CA;  Table S1  in Appendix). The single-base extension reaction products were separated and evaluated using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry. For each SNP, deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE;  $P<.05,$  ) was checked.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). To identify potential con founders, univariate analyses were performed comparing demographic, clinical, and lifestyle risk factors between patients and controls. An unpaired Student    $t$   test was used to compare the quantitative data and to determine the differences between the cases and the controls, whereas the chisquared test or Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical data. The chi-squared test was applied to identify deviations from HWE. Variables with a  $P$   value less than .05 in univariate analysis ( Table 1 ) or of particular clinical relevance were included in a logistic

regression model. Then, logistic regression analyses were used to determine the effect of each genetic variant on stroke susceptibility after adjustment for the covariates. The odds ratio (OR) and  $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals   $95\%$   CIs) were calculated using the additive genetic model.  

To identify higher-order gene–gene interactions in our samples, we used the generalized multi factor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method (GMDR V0.9,  http:// www.ssg.uab.edu/gmdr/ ), which is a non parametric and genetic model–free approach. Brieﬂy, by pooling multilocus genotypes into high- and low-risk groups, GMDR reduces the dimensionality of the data from N dimensions to 1 dimension. Then, each multilocus genotype is evaluated for its ability to classify and predict the disease status. False-positive results due to multiple analyses are reduced by combining the cross-validation strategy and permutation tests. Furthermore, the GMDR method permits adjustment for discrete and quantitative covariates in various population-based study designs. This method is regarded as a useful and efﬁcient statistical tool for detecting gene–gene interactions while avoiding ‘‘the dimension curse,’’ especially for detecting epistatic interactions in case–control studies using relatively small sample sizes.  

We examined gene–gene interactions using the GMDR method to ﬁnd the best model. Then, a permutation test was employed to conﬁrm the best combination of loci identiﬁed based on the GMDR analysis. An exhaustive search of all possible one-locus to ten-locus models was performed for all variants. The model displaying the minimal prediction error, the maximal cross-validation consistency score, and a  $P$   value of less than .05 automatically derived from the sign test in the GMDR software was considered to be the best model. This result was conﬁrmed by a permutation test of 1000 implemented in  $P$  the GMDR software.    values (2-tailed) less than .05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.  

# Results  

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Recruited Individuals  

The characteristics of the subjects are summarized in Table 1 . The distribution of age and sex between the IS cases and the control subjects were well matched. Similar distributions were observed for BMI and the serum levels of HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG between the 2 groups. As expected, sign i can ce was noted for TC, FBS, SBP, and DBP. Sign i cant ly, the individuals in the case group demonstrated a higher prevalence of smoking.  

# Association between Speciﬁc SNP Genotypes and the Risk of IS  

Genotype frequency distribution and association with IS for the SNPs are shown in  Table S2  in Appendix.  ${\tt R s6025}$   of the  $F5$   gene was not a polymorphic site in our sample; all of the other 12 SNPs tested were in HWE in the controls and were therefore further analyzed. The positive results are summarized in  Table 2 . One SNP in the KNG1  gene was associated with IS susceptibility based on an additive genetic model (rs710446:    $P\,=\,.012.$  ; OR, 1.247;  $95\%$   CI, 1.050-1.481) after adjusting for covariates

(hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hyper lipid emi a, and smoking status). The association with IS susceptibility remained signiﬁcant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (rs710446:  corrected  $P=.014_{,}$  ). In the logistic analysis according to strat i cation of IS subtype, rs710446 of KNG1 gene was associated with LAA stroke susceptibility   $\textstyle P=.024$  ; OR,  $1.224;$  ;   $95\%$   CI, 1.027-1.460), and this association survived Bonferroni correction  $P~=~.027)$  ( corrected   ), whereas rs710446 of  KNG1  and rs8178591 of PROS1 showed minimal evidence of association with lacunar stroke because these associations did not withstand a Bonferroni correction ( Table 2 ). Furthermore, no signiﬁcant difference in the frequencies of the genotypes of the other candidate genes was detected between the stroke patients and the control participants based on analysis according to total IS or strat i cation of IS subtype ( Tables S2 and S3  in Appendix).  

# Analysis of Gene–Gene Interaction Model that Contribute to IS—Results from GMDR  

Because gene–gene interactions may exert an important impact on complex human disease susceptibility, we investigated the existence of gene–gene interactions that could contribute to stroke risk using the GMDR method. The GMDR method was used to assess the contributions of combinations of the 12 examined SNPs to IS using the levels of BMI, FBS, DBP, SBP, and blood lipids (TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C) and smoking status as covariates.  

The results of the GMDR analysis of the association between single- to ten-loci and IS are summarized in Table 3 . Following covariate adjustments, the best model was a three-locus model ( ALOX5AP  rs4293222,  THBD rs1042580, and  KNG1  rs710446), suggesting that these 3 variants together contribute to the etiology of IS. This three-locus model displayed the highest level of testing balance accuracy (.5836), a cross-validation consistency of 10/10, and scored 10 for the sign test at the .0010 significance level ( Table 3 ). Furthermore, the signiﬁcant interactions between the above three-locus models were conﬁrmed using a permutation test   $(P~<~.001)$  ). The three-locus genotype combinations were classiﬁed into high- or low-risk groups (as shown in  Fig 1 ). Based on the chi-squared test, the OR of the high-risk combination of the three-locus model increased the risk of IS by 2.53- fold   $(95\%$   CI, 1.60-4.01;    $P<.0001\rangle$  ). In addition, following covariate adjustments, a signiﬁcant single-locus model emerged, consisting of  KNG1  rs710446, which displayed a moderate level of testing balance accuracy (.5586), a cross-validation consistency of 10/10, and scored 9 for the sign test at the .0107 sign i can ce level, as conﬁrmed by a permutation test   $\left(P=.003\right)$  ), indicating a main effect of this SNP on IS.  

Overall, the three-locus model ( ALOX5AP  rs4293222, THBD  rs1042580, and  KNG1  rs710446) displayed the highest level of testing balance accuracy, 10/10 crossvalidation consistency, and scored 10 for the sign test  $P=.0010)$  ). The three-locus model was thus regarded as the best model of gene–gene interactions.

# Discussion  

Ident i cation of Genetic Main Effects and Gene–Gene Interactions That Contribute to IS Susceptibility in a Chinese Population  

IS a complex multi factorial and polygenic disorder that is thought to result from interactions between various conventional risk factors and an individual’s genetic background. The primary pathogenic etiology of stroke differs according to race and ethnicity. Intra cranial atherosclerosis, which is associated with lacunae and with large infarcts, is more prevalent in China than in the Western world; the majority of strokes are of ischemic origin with an a the roth rom bot ic trigger in the Chinese Han population.   We investigated the contributions of the hypothesized genetic factors to the susceptibility of IS. Our results revealed that rs710446 of  KNG1  gene was associated with IS susceptibility in logistic regression, which is consistent with the results of GMDR singlelocus analysis. These results highlighted a region in the KNG1  gene as a likely susceptibility locus, with tagging SNP associated with stroke susceptibility. Our study discovered the novel contribution of  KNG1  gene to IS risk for the ﬁrst time, and the previous Diabetes Heart Study revealed minimal evidence of association between variants of  KNG1  genes and sub clinical cardiovascular diseases.   These intriguing results may indicate an important role of  KNG1  gene in vascular disease.  

It is believed that epistatic interactions between genes in a pathogenic framework (from multiple pathogenic pathways to disease-related genetic networks) may play an important role in determining an individual’s susceptibility to complex diseases,   including IS. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that epistasis between genes in multiple a the roth rom bot ic pathways may play a vital role in determining the susceptibility to IS. Our results showed that the gene–gene interactions of 3 genetic variants in ALOX5AP (rs4293222), THBD (rs1042580), and  KNG1  (rs710446) were identiﬁed to be sign i cant ly associated with stroke risk. Our ﬁndings suggest, for the ﬁrst time, that the epistasis between genes in at hero thrombosis-related genetic interaction networks conferred the genetic susceptibility to IS in a Chinese population. We consider the results of the present study to be exp lor at ive and thus ﬁnd these results intriguing. However, a more convincing conclusion can only be warranted by further independent replication of the results in other ethnic groups in the future.  

It is worth mentioning that the epistatic interactions between  ALOX5AP ,  THBD , and  KNG1  genes were identiﬁed specially based on GMDR analysis. In recent years, increasing studies have focused on gene–gene interactions, which is partially because of the appearance of a new statistical theory. The MDR method, combined with a cross-validation strategy to manage high-dimensional ‘‘omics’’ data, is an efﬁcient statistical tool to explore the genetic etiology of complex diseases.   False-positive results because of multiple comparisons are reduced via a combination of the cross-validation strategy and permutation testing implemented in the MDR software. However, the MDR-based approaches do not allow for covariates. The GMDR method, which is based on MDR, uses statistical scoring to manage both quantitative and dichotomous traits and permits adjustment for covariates. The GMDR method has been demonstrated to serve as a useful and promising tool for detecting gene– gene interactions while avoiding ‘‘the dimension curse,’’ especially for detecting epistatic interactions in case– control studies using relatively small sample sizes.   In our study, the GMDR analysis suggested that the combination of  ALOX5AP  (rs4293222),  THBD  (rs1042580), and KNG1  (rs710446) represented the best model after adjusting for the covariates. This SNP combination increased the risk of IS by 2.53-fold, implying that the gene–gene interaction is an important component of the genetic architecture of IS. Notably, gene–gene interactions have been reported at the cellular level,   indicating that a signiﬁcant association at the statistical level is relevant to the underlying pathogenic mechanism at the biological level.  

# The Associated Genes and Potential Biological Mechanism Underlying Epistatic Interactions  

Our study revealed that epistatic interactions between the  ALOX5AP ,  THBD , and  KNG1  genes played a pivotal role in the subjects’ vulnerability to IS. However, the biological mechanism underlying epistasis is difﬁcult to interpret based on our current knowledge. The physiological activities of the investigated genes may provide a preliminary explanation.  ALOX5AP  encodes for the ara chi donate 5-lip oxygen as e (5-LOX)-activating protein, which is a key enzyme involved in leu kotri ene biosynthesis in the 5-LOX pathway, an important ROSgenerating system. After  ALOX5AP  gene mutations, the encoded proteins may increase 5-LOX activity, promote leu kotri ene-mediated in amma tory damage to vascular walls, accelerate atherosclerosis, and promote the formation of vulnerable plaques. A genome-wide linkage anal- ysis conducted by the deCODE group in an Icelandic population had suggested a four-SNP haplotype in the ALOX5AP  gene that conferred a nearly doubled risk of stroke.   Several groups have attempted to replicate the association between IS and    $A L O X5A P$   variants, but the 28  Importantly, results have remained controversial. a meta-analysis study indicated in suf cie nt evidence for claiming an association between variants in the  $A L O X5A P$  29    gene and the risk of stroke. These results are partially consistent with our single-locus ﬁndings. Zintzaras et   ${\mathsf{a l}}^{29}$    also pointed out that rigorous genetic association studies investigating gene–gene and gene– environment interactions may generate conclusive ﬁndings regarding the contribution of the  ALOX5AP  gene to stroke. We identiﬁed synergistic gene–gene interactions between    $A L O X5A P$   and other genes, including  THBD and  KNG1 . These intriguing results suggest that these genes may contribute to IS via some common pathogenic mechanism.  

Thr ombo mod ul in (TM) is an integral member of the protein C anti coagulation pathway. Polymorphisms in the  THBD  gene have been implicated in thrombosis, in amma tion, cellular proliferation, and arteriosclerosis, which overlap with the scope of the  ALOX5AP  gene. The  THBD  gene product TM is a cell surface–expressed glycoprotein which is predominantly synthesized by vascular endo the li al cells that acts as a critical cofactor for thrombin-mediated activation of protein C (PC). The activated TM–PC pathway is best known for its natural anticoagulant and anti-in amma tory properties. Furthermore, changes in  THBD  gene expression reﬂect endothelial activation and damage, an initial step of atherosclerosis.   The multiple physiological effects of the  THDB  gene in thrombosis, in amma tion, and atherosclerosis implicate an association between  THDB  gene polymorphisms and vascular disease. Several reports have analyzed the contribution of the  THBD  gene to IS, but the relationship between  THBD  gene polymorphisms and IS has remained ambivalent at best.   Moreover, the results of our single-locus ﬁndings concerning the association between  THBD  gene polymorphisms and IS were negative. Thus, we postulated that the  THBD  gene is a low-penetrance susceptibility marker that exerts a minor marginal effect on IS, and this gene may impact stroke risk via an epistatic mechanism.  

Interestingly, the  KNG1  gene not only modulated susce pti bil it y to IS via epistatic interactions but also displayed a signiﬁcant independent main effect in our study. A prominent coding polymorphism (rs710446) of KNG1  was associated with the susceptibility to IS in our sample. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. The gene products kininogens (KNGs) are multi functional proteins involved in multiple pathways; these proteins participate in the generation of kinins, act as cofactors for the intrinsic coagulation system, inhibit cysteine proteases, and modulate platelet aggregation, ang io genesis, and the acute-phase response. Thus, the role of the  KNG1  gene in vascular disease or remodeling has been extensively investigated, yielding many intriguing results. This gene was identiﬁed as a positional candidate gene for internal elastic lamina lesions,   the early events underlying atherosclerosis. 33   Furthermore, Ribeiro et al reported a high level of KNG in patients with in-stent restenosis after angioplasty, indicating that these patients may exhibit an increased basal activity of kinins, which is regarded as a proinﬂammatory and a the rogen ic state. Additional evidence demonstrated the contributions of the  KNG1  gene to the a dip one ct in levels and hypertension,   which are well-established risk factors for atherosclerosis. In addition to contributing to vascular remodeling,  KNG1  gene polymorphisms are involved in modulating the intrinsic coagulation system. A recent GWAS identiﬁed  KNG1 gene as a genetic determinant of activated partial thromboplastin time.   Rs710446, perhaps the most common SNP in  KNG1  gene, causes a non synonymous substitution (Ile581Thr) in high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), which may be a component of a potential regulatory region associated with increased  KNG1  gene expression. The intriguing results from the RATIO study revealed that extreme high levels of HK are associated with an increased risk of IS.   In conclusion, the accumulating evidence of  KNG1  polymorphism in pathologic thrombosis tendency and vascular remodeling implicates a potential mechanism by which the  KNG1  gene contributes to IS. Our study revealed that  KNG1  gene contributes to IS risk via both a genetic main effect and epistatic interactions in a Chinese population. Nevertheless, additional information is required regarding the underlying mechanism, including deeper insight from the statistical level to the cell biological level. Moreover, because KNG appears to be crucial for pathologic thrombus formation and in amma tion but dispensable for hemostasis, it is plausible that  KNG1  gene serves as not only a novel genetic contributor to IS but also a potential drug target for stroke and other thr ombo embo li c diseases.  

The ident i cation of a synergistic interaction between the  ALOX5AP ,  THBD , and  KNG1  genes that contributes to stroke susceptibility emphasizes the importance of testing for epistasis and illustrates the complexity of the genetic architecture of IS. Furthermore, our data conﬁrms that IS susceptibility may be modulated by not only a single locus that contributes to disease but also nonlinear epistatic (gene–gene) interactions, as previously demon38   strated by others. In particular, Babu et al searched for epistatic interactions between candidate genes in ﬁbrinolytic pathways and stroke and found that interactions between 2 genes can engender a sign i cant ly higher risk for stroke than any single gene, suggesting that such variants act synergistic ally. Two additional studies also reported that the risk of stroke increases with the number of high-risk genotypes caused by in amma tory gene polymorphisms,   suggesting that gene–gene interactions involving multiple variants may change the susceptibility of speciﬁc subjects to a disease. Our results indicated that epistatic interactions between genes ( ALOXAP , THBD , and KNG1 ) involved in multiple a the roth rom bot ic pathways contributed to the susceptibility to IS. To the best of our knowledge, the synergistic effect of the  ALOX5AP ,  THBD , and  KNG1 gene SNPs may contribute to the interface between the at hero sclerotic and thrombotic pathways and is critically involved in stroke development. Notably, our examined stroke patients were composed entirely of LAA and lacunar stroke cases. These 2 subtypes of IS display some overlapping pathogen es is,   such as hypertension, vascular remodeling (atherosclerosis, micro a the roma, and lip oh ya lino s is), and pathologic thrombosis, which may be modulated by a common genetic architecture (epistasis between genes involved in multiple a the roth rom bot ic pathways).  

# Conclusion  

In conclusion, our study is the ﬁrst to provide evidence that variants in the a the rogen ic  ALOX5AP ,  THBD , and KNG1  genes potentiate the risk of IS via both a genetic main effect and epistatic interactions in a Chinese population. This is the ﬁrst attempt to perform a systematic approach to integrate the effects of SNPs in multiple atheroth rom bot ic pathway–related genes on stroke risk in a Chinese population. Our results indicate that a set of SNPs associated with genes in a disease-related genetic network provides a network-based epistatic interaction model associated with stroke risk. We believe that these ﬁndings will guide further investigations in genetic epidemiology and may shed light on the genetic architecture of IS.
