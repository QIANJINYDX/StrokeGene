Objective:  This study aimed to investigate the relationship between methylene tetra hydro folate  reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism and early neurological deterioration (END) in patients  with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and any possible interactions between specific MTHFR alleles  and traditional risk factors among a Han Chinese cohort.  

Methods:  434 AIS patients were consecutively recruited between January 2017 and June 2019,  including 129 END and 305 non-END cases. A candidate gene association study design was used  to analyze the association between MTHFR gene polymorphism and END risk. The polymerase  chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was employed to ge­ notype the MTHFR C677T polymorphism. The interaction al analyses were performed using the  multi factor dimensionality reduction test.  

Results:  Hyperglycemia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.410,   $95\;\%$   confidence interval [CI]: 1.436 – 4.046,   ${\mathfrak{p}}=$  0.001), neurological function impairment (NIHSS score   ${>}5.$  ) (OR: 2.158,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.337 – 3.484,   $p$     $=0.002)$   on admission, and hyper homo cy steinem i a (HHcy) (OR: 2.570,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.229 – 5.376,   $p$     $\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\$  ) were independently associated with END. The TT genotype (OR: 1.710,   $95\%\mathrm{CI};$  :  1.021 – 2.863,  $\mathsf{p}=0.043)$   and T allele (OR: 1.710,   $95\%{\mathrm{CI}}$  : 1.021 – 2.863,  $\mathtt{p}=0.043)$   of this C677T  polymorphism were associated with susceptibility to END, and the TT genotype was more com­ mon in the subjects with HHcy (OR: 2.525,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.111 – 5.739,  ${\bf P}=0.023)$  ). In addition, we also  found interactions for END risk between the C677T polymorphism and traditional risk factors for  END, including: hyperglycemia on admission, drinking, and moderate to severe neurological  deficits (OR 1.237,  $95\;\%$  CI 0.227 – 6.734), although the results were not statistically significant (p   $=0.806)$  .  

Conclusions:  Our results show a possible association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and  gene – environment interactions with END susceptibility in a Han Chinese cohort.  

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke is associated with the greatest loss of disability-adjusted life years of any disease in China, and ischemic stroke (IS) accounts  for approximately   $80\ \%$   of all strokes [ 1 ]. The term  “ early neurological deterioration ”  (END) is used when a patient shows no  improvement or experiences deterioration in the severity of their neurological deficits in the early poststroke period [ 2 ]. According to  different severity threshold and interval of clinical evaluation, the incidence of END ranges from   $2.2\,\%$   to   $37.5\,\%$   [ 3 , 4 ]. END is closely  associated with poor outcomes after stroke [ 3 ]. It is therefore essential to identify reliable predictors of END. END shares common  path o physiological mechanisms with IS, which is a multi factorial disease with a strong genetic background. And so, the study of  susceptibility genes for END has attracted researcher ’ s attention.  

The human 5, 10-methylene tetra hydro folate reductase (MTHFR) gene, characterized by its structure of 11 exons, is genomic ally  located at the  $1{\mathrm{p}}36.3$   locus on the short arm of chromosome 1, denoting a precise and critical position within the human genome for its  involvement in folate metabolism [ 5 ]. MTHFR plays a critical role in regulating plasma homo cyst eine (Hcy) levels by converting 5,  10-methylene tetra hydro folate to 5-methyl tetra hydro folate [ 6 ]. The C677T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene (the substitution of  cytosine (C) with thymine (T) at nucleotide position 677) results in a specific genetic alteration affecting the activity of the MTHFR [ 7 ].  The MTHFR C677T mutation is strongly associated with at hero sclerotic diseases, such as stroke. A meta-analysis with a large sample  size demonstrated that the MTHFR  $677\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}$   mutation increased the risk of IS by nearly 1.5 times in people over 18 years old [ 8 ]. In  people over 65 years of age, IS risk is also significantly higher in MTHFR C677T T allele carriers [ 7 ]. Moreover, Hcy levels are closely  related to IS risk in the Chinese population [ 9 ]. One study also suggested that elevated levels of Hcy were predictive factors for the  occurrence of END in patients with acute IS [ 10 ].  

To date, few studies have been conducted into genetic biomarkers of END risk. The present study aimed to investigate the role of the  MTHFR C677T polymorphism and Hcy levels in END, as well as the interaction between this polymorphism and other traditional risk  factors for END in acute IS patients.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. Participants  

Participants were consecutively recruited from acute IS patients who were admitted to the Department of Neurology in the Third  People ’ s Hospital of Chengdu, affiliated to Southwest Jiaotong University, between January 1, 2017, and June 30, 2019. We included  only patients who meet the following criteria: 1) a diagnosis of IS as per the standards of the World Health Organization (WHO); 2)  admission within  $48\,\mathrm{h}$   of onset; and 3) agreed to participate in the research. The patients with the following conditions will be excluded  from this study: 1) patients with secondary cerebral infarction with definitive reasons; 2) patients with other serious diseases, such as  organ failure, severe infections; 3) patients discharged after less than 7 days in hospital; 4) patients who received intravenous  thr ombo lysis or endo vascular interventional therapy; and 5) patients with hemorrhagic transformation of the cerebral infarction. We  employed a recruitment strategy combining physician ’ s recommendations with the attitudes of patients to enroll study participants.  All subjects included were divide into two groups (END and Non-END ） according to definition. The Ethics Committee of the Third  People ’ s Hospital of Chengdu approved this hospital-based study (Reference number: [2021]-T-39), and all patients or their families  signed an informed consent form. The study is also registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( www.chictr.org.cn ):  ChiCTR2000032684.  

# 2.2. Clinical data Collection and evaluation  

Within  $^{24\,\mathrm{h}}$   of admission, we collected the following clinical data from all included subjects: 1) demographic information (age and  sex); 2) vascular risk factors (hypertension, hyper lipid emi a, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation (AF), previous stroke,  history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), smoking, or drinking alcohol); and 3) baseline laboratory tests (fasting blood glucose,  routine blood test, coagulation function, and biochemical blood indicators including C-reactive protein (CRP), Hcy, total cholesterol,  triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol).  

# 2.3. Definitions of research indicators  

The degree of neurological deficit was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and END was defined  as an increase of at least 1 point in motor items or at least 2 points in the total score within 1 week after admission [ 10 ]. Hyper­ homo cy steinem i a (HHcy) was defined as plasma Hc  $_{r>10\ \upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}}$   [ 11 ]. High-risk CRP was defined as hypersensitive-CRP   $\mathrm{(hscCRP)}>$   $3.0\,\mathrm{mg/L}$   [ 12 ]. Hyper uric emi a was defined as blood uric acid   ${>}420\,\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$   on two different days, regardless of the patient ’ s sex [ 13 ].  Severe neurological impairment was defined as   $\tt N I H S S>5$  (i.e., a non-minor stroke) [ 14 ]. Hyperglycemia refers to the 1998 WHO  standard. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure   ${\geq}140\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   and/or diastolic blood pressure   ${\geq}90\,\mathrm{mmHg}.$  , according to  the 1999 WHO standard. A history of smoking was defined as more than one cigarette per day (on average) for more than 1 year, and a  history of drinking was defined as drinking alcohol at least 12 times during the previous year [ 15 ]. A diagnosis of dys lipid emi a was  based on the 2016 Chinese guidelines for the management of dys lipid emi a in adults. Overweight was defined as a body mass index   ${\geq}24\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  .  

# 2.4. MTHFR C677T genotyping  

Sample DNA was acquired by taking  $2\,\mathrm{mL}$   of peripheral venous blood from each subject, which was anti coagulated with sodium  citrate. Next, DNA was extracted using a Blood Genomic DNA Isolation Midi Kit (DP318-02/03, TIANGEN, Beijing) according to the  manufacturer ’ s instructions. To genotype the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction  fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) according to Frosst ’ s method [ 16 ]. We first performed PCR amplification using the upstream  primer   $5^{\prime}$  -TGA AGG AGA AGG TGT CTG CGG GA $\cdot3^{\prime}$    and the downstream primer   $5^{\prime}$  -AGG AGC GTG CGG TGA GAG TG $3^{\prime}$    (designed by  Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The objective fragment for PCR amplification involved a 198 base pair (bp) segment encompassing  the 677 locus within the MTHFR gene. The reaction system was as follows: primer 10 pmol each, template DNA   $100\;\mathrm{ng}$  , Taq DNA  polymerase  ${}^{1}\mathrm{~U~}$  , four dNTPs  $200\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$   each; final volume   $25\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$  . The PCR conditions were as follows:   $94\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for   $2\,\mathrm{{min}}$  ; 30 cycles of   $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 s,  $61\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30~s$  , and  $72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\ s;$   and   $72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $5\;\mathrm{min}$  . The PCR products were detected using   $8~\%$   non-denaturing  polya cry l amide gel electrophoresis. The amplified product was then digested using the restriction end on ucl ease  Hin f I (total vol­ ume  $20\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$  :  $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   amplified product,  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   buffer,  $H i n f\operatorname{I}8\operatorname{U}$  , and  $7\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   deionized water) at   $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   overnight. The product was determined  using   $3\,\%$   agarose gel electrophoresis. After staining with ethidium bromide, the digestion results were observed under an ultraviolet  lamp. The C allele of MTHFR C677T demonstrates resistance to  Hin f I cleavage, resulting in the retention of a 198bp fragment.  Conversely, the T allele undergoes specific cleavage by the  Hin f I enzyme, leading to the generation of a 23bp fragment and a 175bp  fragment.  

# 2.5. Statistical analysis  

We used SPSS 21.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) to analyze the data. Quantitative data (normal distribution) were described by mean   $\pm$  standard deviation (SD), and between-group variation was assessed using the unpaired  t -test. The data with Non-normal distribution  were represented by the median and interquartile range (IQR), and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed for intergroup com­ parisons. The  $\chi^{2}$    test was used for evaluating categorical variables. The genetic association analyses were performed in three genetic  models (dominant, recessive, and allelic comparison). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment of  traditional risk factors for IS was performed to obtain the crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\,\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) for  the risk genotype. Multi factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) software was used for detecting the possible interactions between  genetic and traditional risk factors [ 17 ]. Unless otherwise specified, the significance level was set at   $\upalpha=0.05$  .

134 females aged  $68.62\pm12.08$   years). Univariate analysis revealed no significant differences in sex or age between groups   $(P>0.05)$  .  However, there were more subjects with over 65 years old (99 vs. 200 participants) in END group, and it was also found that the END  subjects presented higher frequency of   $_\mathrm{NHSS}{>}5$  , admission hyperglycemia, HHcy, drinking history, TIA history, and abnormal white  blood cell ratios   $(P<0.05)$  ). After adjusting for covariates, there were significant differences only in   $_\mathrm{NHSS}{>}5$  , admission hypergly­ cemia and HHcy among groups   $\left(P<0.05\right)$  ). Background characteristics of the subjects are given in  Table 1 .  

# 3.2. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism analyses  

# 3.2.1. Relationship between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and END  

The C677T polymorphism was successfully genotyped in all samples. It was found that the TT genotype increased the risk of END  under the recessive model (OR: 1.710,   $95~\%$   CI: 1.021 – 2.863,  $P=0.043)$  ), and the risk for END also increased in subjects with the T  allele with an adjusted OR (  $.95\;\%$   CI) of 1.583 (1.181 – 2.121)   $(\mathtt{P}=0.002)$  ). Detailed results are presented in  Table 2 .  

# 3.2.2. Relationship between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and HHcy  

We also analyzed the association of MTHFR C677T of HHcy (see  Table 3 ). The results showed that the TT genotype frequency was  higher in subjects with HHcy (OR: 2.525,   $95~\%$   CI: 1.111 – 5.739,   $P=0.023.$  ). However, no significant differences were found in CC  genotype or allele distribution.  

# 3.3. Interaction analysis of MTHFR C677T and traditional risk factors in END  

All variables with  $\tt P<0.1$   in uni variable analysis on risk factors for END in 434 samples were entered into the analyses using MDR  software. The MDR model identified the fourth-order interaction among MTHFR C677T and drinking, admission hyperglycemia as  well as  $\tt N I H S S>5$   as the most optimal, with a best cross-validation consistency of 8/10. However, no statistical significance was found  for this model   $(\mathbf{P}=0.2804)$  ). After adjusting for age  ${\geq}65$   years, WBC abnormality, TIA history, drinking, smoking, diabetes history,  HHcy, admission hyperglycemia and NIHSS  ${>}5$   through multivariate logistic regression analysis, this model still had no statistical  significance (OR: 1.237,  $95~\%$   CI: 0.227 – 6.734,  $\mathbf{P}=0.806)$  ).  

# 4. Discussion  

END incidence within 7 days after admission is reportedly  $20.18\%–42.5\:\%$   in Chinese hospitalized IS patients [ 18 – 20 ]. Our study  showed that the incidence of END was  $29.7\ \%$   in acute IS patients, which is consistent with previous studies.  

In the present study,  $\tt N I H S S>5$  , admission hyperglycemia and HHcy were associated with an increased risk of END. The patho­ physiological mechanisms precipitating END predominantly encompass the lack of efficacious collateral circulatory pathways,  thrombotic progression, cerebro vascular event recurrence, augmentation of intra cranial pressure, e pile p to geni c activities, and hem­ orrhagic transmutation [ 21 ]. It has been reported that the incidence of END is proportional to stroke severity at admission (as  determined by the NIHSS) [ 22 ]. A higher NIHSS score indicates more severe cerebral infarction or edema in patients, so a relatively  high level of complications and oxygen-free radical release may be the fundamental causes of END [ 20 ]. Furthermore, previous studies  [ 2 , 23 ] have demonstrated a significant association between hyperglycemia and END. Elevated fasting glucose levels can lead to an  overproduction of harmful substances in cerebral tissue, such as lactate and reactive oxygen species, which exacerbate neuronal  damage and contribute to the onset of END. The excessive accumulation of lactate in the brain may convert critically hypo per fused

tissues into infarcts, further impairing neurological function. Additionally, hyperglycemia has a pro thr ombo tic effect, increasing the  likelihood of thrombus extension. Hyper gly ce mic-induced micro vascular complications can also impair collateral circulation, making  patients more vulnerable to fluctuations in blood pressure and increasing the risk of hypo perfusion. Together, these changes pre­ cipitate the development of END. Hcy is a non-essential amino acid that contains sulfur and is mainly produced by the de methyl ation of  methionine in food. Studies have shown that HHcy increases the inflammatory response, which may lead to unstable carotid  at hero sclerotic plaque and carotid/intra cranial artery stenosis. HHcy is also a high-risk factor for cerebro vascular disease [ 24 ], and a  meta-analysis demonstrated that HHcy was strongly associated with END risk [ 25 ].  

Our results suggested that the MTHFR C677T TT genotype and T allele increased END risk, and in HHcy patients, there was a higher  TT genotype frequency. MTHFR is a key enzyme in the folate metabolism pathway and plays an essential role in regulating blood HCY  levels [ 6 ]. However, this pathway is strongly influenced by the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms [ 26 ]. In the   $677\mathsf{C}>\mathsf{T}$    mutation, where the base C is replaced by T, the encoded alanine is replaced by valine, which results in a   $70\;\%$  decrease in MTHFR  activity [ 16 ]. In IS patients with the  $677\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}$   mutation, Hcy levels are usually increased [ 6 ]. However, the effects of the C677T site on  enzyme activity are not affected by the   $1298\mathsf{A}>\mathsf{C}$  mutation [ 27 ]. MTHFR is closely related to cardiovascular and cerebro vascular  events. A meta-analysis showed that coronary artery disease risk was 1.2 times higher in   $\mathrm{T}$  allele carriers at C677T [ 28 ]. As an in­ dependent predictor of at hero sclerotic diseases, HHcy may also be a mechanism of END. It is thus presumed that MTHFR C677T may  be directly involved in the pathogen es is of IS-related END by causing changes in Hcy metabolism.  

We also found that interactions among the C677T polymorphism,  $\mathrm{\tt{N I H S S}}\!>\!5$  , admission hyperglycemia and drinking might be a risk  factor for END. Although the subsequent validation analysis revealed no statistical significance of this finding, we speculated that the  onset of END might result from interactions among many factors.  

Limitations of the present study include the challenges in multivariable interaction analysis, where despite employing advanced  techniques, the identified four-factor model involving traditional risk factors and MTHFR C677T polymorphism in relation to END did  not reach statistical significance. Additionally, the small sample size may have constrained the analyses ’  statistical power, hindering  the identification of significant findings. These issues highlight the necessity for future research to explore deeper into the genetic and  environmental factors influencing END and to utilize larger sample sizes to enhance study robustness and findings ’  applicability.  

# 5. Conclusion  

The present study indicates that in the Han population of Chengdu (Sichuan, China), the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, admission  hyperglycemia, HHcy, and the degree of neurological deficit are related to the onset of END after acute IS. Moreover, the interaction  between traditional risk factors and susceptible genes may be involved in END onset.
