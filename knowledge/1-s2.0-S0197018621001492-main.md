Here, we report the synthesis and neuro protective capacity of 27 compounds with a bisphenol hydroxyl-substituted 1,2,4-triazole core or 1,2,4-oxadiazole core for stroke therapy.  In vitro  studies of the neuro­ protective effects of compounds  1 – 27  on sodium nitro prussi de (SNP)-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells indicate  that compound  24  is the most effective compound conferring potent protection against oxidative injury. Com­ pound  24  inhibits reactive oxygen species (ROS ）  accumulation and restores the mitochondrial membrane po­ tential (MMP). Moreover, further analysis of the mechanism showed that compound  24  activates the antioxidant  defence system by promoting the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and  increasing the expression of haem oxygenase 1 (HO-1). An  in vivo  study was performed in a rat model of transient  focal cerebral ischaemia generated by the intra lumina l occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Com­ pound  24  significantly reduced brain infarction and improved neurological function. Overall, compound  24  potentially represents a promising compound for the treatment of stroke.

# 1. Introduction  

able to block and scavenge ROS are considered to prevent and treat  ischemic stroke.  

Ischemic stroke is a disease that leads to high mortality and  morbidity rates in the clinic. Its pathogen es is is complicated, the target is  not clear, and a specific therapeutic drug is not available ( Allen and  Bay rak tut an, 2009 ;  Ma et al., 2020 ;  Rai et al., 2017 ). Currently, re­ combinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only thr ombo ly tic  drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of ischemic stroke, but its  half-life is short   $(4{-}6\,\mathrm{h})$  ), and the treatment window is small, which limits  its use( Stroke rt, 1995 ;  Durukan and Tatlisumak, 2007 ). Therefore, there  is an urgent need to develop additional effective therapies for ischemic  stroke ( Ayuso et al., 2015 ). There has been a considerable body of evi­ dence over the last few years to suggest that reactive oxygen species  (ROS) associated with oxidative stress are considered the fundamental  mechanism of brain damage caused by ischemic stroke ( Allen and  Bay rak tut an, 2009 ;  Huang et al., 2018 ;  Candelario-Jalil, 2009 ). Accu­ mulation of ROS mediate damage to cell structure such as lipid( Sen  et al., 2010 ), cell membrane, protein ( Darlington et al., 2007 ) and DNA  ( Love et al., 2000 )in path o genetic progress of ischemic stroke. There­ fore, identification of new and more efficient neuro protective agents  

Activating cellular endogenous antioxidant signalling pathways and  promoting the transcription of a broad range of cyto protective genes to  remove ROS would be considered as a desirable therapy( Yuan et al.,  2020 ). Keap1/Nrf2/ARE is one of the important antioxidant signalling  pathways, Nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a  transcription factor containing a conserved basic leucine zipper (bZIP)  structure that is normally located in the cytoplasm of cells, plays an  important role in regulating redox homeostasis by activating the cellular  antioxidant response ( Jaramillo and Zhang, 2013 ;  Lu et al., 2020 ). In  response to electro phil es and ROS under cellular stress, Nrf2 will be  transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, promoting the tran­ scription of an expansive set of antioxidant and cyto protective enzymes,  such as NAD(P)H:quinone ox ido reductase 1 (NQO1), haem oxygenase 1  (HO-1), and glut at hi one S-transfer as e, to combat reactive oxidants and  electrophilic species ( Tran et al., 2019 ;  Itoh et al., 1999 ;  Tonelli et al.,  2018 ). HO-1 plays a key role in reducing oxidative damage, resulting in  increased survival of cells under oxidative stress( Ding et al., 2015 ).  Up regulation of HO-1 is a highly effective therapeutic desirable for

protects against cerebral ischaemia ( Li et al., 2016 ).  

Iron is essential for all living organisms( Kon t oghi org he s and Kon­ toghiorghe, 2020 ). However, iron overload is harmful because of the  build-up of ROS by Fenton reaction( Illes et al., 2019 ), and induces  oxidative stress in the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke ( Liao et al., 2020 ).  Many reports support the therapeutic potential and clinical application  of iron chelators( Bertamino et al., 2018 ). Defer as i rox, a potential oral  iron chelator, has been studied as a potential treatment for Alzheimer ’  s  and Parkinson ’  s diseases with very promising results ( Gu et al., 2018 ).  

Our previous study has demonstrated that compound I （ Fig. 1 ） , a  hybrid of Celecoxib and Defer as i rox, shows good neuro protection both  in vivo  and  in vitro  by Fe(II) chelation and active Keap1/Nrf2/ARE  signing way ( Liao et al., 2020 ). For further study, acetyl ation or remove  of the s ulf on amide substituent of benzene ring C show little protection  effect on PC12, but it ’ s interesting protective effect notable elevate when  remove the entire Ring C. Therefore, twenty-seven 1,2,4-triazole and 1,  2,4-oxadiazole core compounds were designed and their protective ef­ fects were studied.

Cells were  maintained in DMEM containing   $5\%$     $(\mathbf{v}/\mathbf{v})$   HS and   $5\%$     $\mathrm{(v/v)}$   FBS and  incubated in a humidified atmosphere of  $5\%\odot_{2}$  at   $37~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  

The LO2 cell line was purchased from the Experimental Animal  Center of Sun Yat-sen University. Cells were maintained in DMEM  containing  $10\%$   (v/v) FBS and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of   $5\%$   $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$    at   $37~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  

# 2.5. Cell viability assay  

MTT assay was used to determine the cell viability and cyto toxicity.  PC12 cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of   $5\times10{\circ}3$   cells  per well for  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The cells were pretreated with compounds for  $_{2\,\mathrm{h}}$   and   $500~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP was add for additional   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . Cells that were treated with  DMEM were set as the control group.  $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   MTT   $\mathrm{5\,mg/mL})$   were added  to previously treated cells for  $3\,\mathrm{h}$   at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   in the presence of  $5\%\,{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$  . The  super nat ant was discarded,   $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of DMSO were added to 96-well  plates, and the solutions were mixed thoroughly. The absorbance  values (OD values) were recorded at   $570\,\mathrm{\nm}$   using an EPOCH 2  microplate reader (BioTek Devices). The experiments were repeated at  least 3 times.  

# 2.6. Hoechst 33258 staining assay and intracellular ROS analysis  

PC12 cells were cultured in  $20\,\mathrm{mm}$   Laser confocal dishes at a density  of   $5\times10^{\circ}4$   cells    $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The cells were then pretreat ith  $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  compound  24  for 2 h and incubated with  $500\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for 24 h. Cells that  were not treated with compound  24  were set as the control group.

The medium was removed, and  the cells were washed twice with DMEM. The relative fluorescence in­ tensities of Hoechst 33258 were detected using a fluorescence micro­ scope (Olympus, FV3000, Japan) at excitation and emission  wavelengths of  $346\,\mathsf{n m}$   and  $460\,\mathrm{nm}$  , and relative fluorescence intensities  of ROS were detected at excitation and emission wavelengths of  $488\,\mathrm{nm}$  and   $525~\mathrm{nm}$  .  

# 2.7. Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)  

PC12 cells were cultured in  $20\,\mathrm{mm}$   Laser confocal dishes at a density  of   $5\times10^{\circ}4$   cells    $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The cells were then pretreat ith  $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  compound  24  for 2 h and incubated with  $500\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for 24 h. Cells that  were not treated with compound  24  were set as the control group. JC-1  detection solution was then co incubated with the cells for   $20\,\mathtt{m i n}$   in the  dark. The cell culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed  twice with JC-1 solution buffer. The relative fluorescence intensities  were detected with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, FV3000,  Japan) at excitation and emission wavelengths of  $490\;\mathrm{nm}$   and  $530\;\mathrm{nm}$  ,  respectively, to detect the JC-1 monomer and   $525\ \mathrm{nm}$   and   $590\ \mathrm{nm}$  ,  respectively, to detect JC-1 aggregates.  

# 2.8. Western blot analysis  

PC12 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with different  concentrations of compound  24  (2.5, 5 and  $10\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for various times (0,  1, 3, 6, 12,   $24\;\mathrm{~h~})$  . Cell lysis buffer (containing   $1~\mathrm{\mM}$   phenyl­ methane s ulf on yl fluoride (PMSF)) were used to lyse cells and prepare  whole-cell protein extracts. According to the protocol of Nuclear and  cytoplasmic protein extraction kits, nuclear, cytoplasmic protein  extracts can be prepared. Protein was quantified by bic inchon in ic acid  (BCA) assay kit and separated by   $10\%$   sodium dodecyl sulfate poly­ acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then transferred onto  polyvinyl ide ne difluoride (PVDF) membranes blocking with   $5\%$   skim  milk for   $_{2\,\mathrm{h}}$   at room temperature and then incubated overnight at  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  with a Nrf2 primary antibody (dilution, 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK)  and HO-1 primary antibody (dilution, 1:1000; Cell Signalling Technol­ ogy, Danvers, USA) and washed three times with 1x TBST. Afterwards,  the membrane was further incubated with peroxidase-conjugated Affi­ niPure goat anti-rabbit IgG   $(\mathrm{H}\,+\,\mathrm{L})$   at a dilution of 1:5000 (YEASEN,  Shanghai, China) for   $^{\mathrm{~2~h~}}$   at room temperature. The membrane was  incubated with the reagents of a chemiluminescence kit for 1 min. Next,  ImageJ software was used to quantify the bands.  

# 2.9. Establishment of a rat model of ischaemic stroke  

Animals.  72 male specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley (SD)  rats (body weight, 180 – 220 g) were provided by the Experimental An­ imal Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China; License No.  SYXK (Hunan) 2019-0004). The animals were randomly divided into six  groups: a sham-operated group, model-based control group, positive  control group (edaravone injection,  $10\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$  , and low-dose   $(3\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$  ,  medium-dose   $(10\;\mathrm{m}g/\mathrm{kg})$   and high-dose   $(30~\mathrm{mg/kg})$   groups   $(\mathsf{n}=12$   in  each group).  

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion ( Trotman-Lucas et al., 2019 ) .  The  rats were anaesthetized by administering an intra peritoneal injection of   $7\%$   chloral hydrate   $(5\,\mathrm{\mL/kg})$  ). The left common carotid artery and  external carotid artery were separated and ligated through a median  cervical incision, and the pte ry go frontal artery was separated as well. An  arterial clamp was placed at the proximal and distal carotid arteries, and  4-0 nylon thread was inserted through the incision to a depth of 17 – 20  mm. The wound was disinfected with iodophor, and the skin was su­ tured. In the sham-operated group, the other steps were the same except  that the thread was not inserted. The treatments were injected intra­ peritoneal ly at the onset of the reperfusion period by a blinded inves­ tigator. All procedures were approved by the local Institutional Animal  Care Committee and were conducted in compliance with Chinese  legislation.  

# 2.10. Behavioural tests and TTC staining  

Behavioural tests were performed  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   after the operation according  to Zea Longa ’ s 4-point scoring system( Zhao et al., 2018 ). The test as  follows: 0 points, no defits; 1 point, unable to fully extend the opposite  front paw; 2 points, turns to the outside; 3 points, dumping to the  opposite side; and 4 points, unable to walk spontaneously and displays a  loss of consciousness.  

Animals were killed after the behavioural tests, and brain sections  were taken for TTC staining to observe the cerebral infarct area. The  whole brain was quickly removed, and the olfactory bulb, cerebellum  and lower brainstem were removed and frozen for   $25\;\mathrm{min}$  . Then, these  tissues were coronally cut into 5-7 sections, quickly placed in  $1\%$   TTC for   $20~\mathrm{min}$  , and incubated at   $37\ ^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   for   $20~\mathrm{min}$  . The section were flipped  every  $7–8\ \mathrm{min}$   and fixed with   $4\%$   poly formaldehyde after dyeing. The  normal tissues were stained red and the injured infarcted tissues were  white. After capturing images, the percentage of the cerebral infarct area  was calculated using the image analysis method.  

# 2.11. Measurement of biochemical indicators  

After the end of the behavioural testing, the animals were eutha­ nized, blood was collected from the abdominal vein, and the serum was  stored at  $-20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The levels of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1 β , TNF- $\upalpha_{;}$  , SOD, and MDA, in the serum were detected using enzyme-linked  immuno s or bent assay (ELISA) kits.

Commercially available  substituted benzoic acid and   $^o$  -hydroxy benzamide served as starting  materials and were reacted with thionyl chloride in xylene through a  reaction catalysed by anhydrous pyridine to generate the key in­ ter mediates. The intermediates reacted with hydrazine hydrate to obtain  compounds  1 – 10  and with hydroxyl amine hydrochloride to obtain  compounds  11 – 27 . Target products  1-27  were purified by re crystal li­ zation from ethanol, and their structures were identified using MS,   $\mathrm{^{1}H}$    NMR,   $^{13}\mathrm{C}$   NMR, and HRMS. Compounds  1-27  with a purity of   ${\mathrm{>}}95\%$    were used for subsequent biological experiments. (The results of the  NMR, HPLC and HRMS analyses of compounds  1-27  are provided in the  supporting information.)  

3.2. Evaluating the abilities of the compounds to protect against sodium  nitro prussi de (SNP)-induced cell death  

During ischemic stroke, excessive ROS and free radicals cause cyto­ toxicity and eventually more severe nerve injury. PC12 cells, which are  derived from phe och romo cyto ma of the rat adrenal medulla, are  generally used as a screening model to study nerve injuries( Liao et al.,  2020 ;  Luo et al., 2019 ). SNP has been widely used to induce cerebral  ischaemia-based models in nerve cells( Liu et al., 2011 ). In our experi­ ment, the application of SNP   $(500~\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for   $24\textup{h}$   caused the death of  approximately  $60\%$   of cells (see  Fig. 2 A). The protective potency of the  target compounds at   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   in cells incubated with SNP was first  assessed using the MTT assay, as shown in  Fig. 2 B.  

As shown in  Fig. 2  and  Table 1 , most compounds displayed  remarkable protection of PC12 cells against SNP-induced apoptosis. The  protective effects of compounds  11 – 27  were noticeably better than  compounds  1 – 10 , indicating that the oxadiazole core structure was  better than the triazole core structure. Compared with the control group,

(Data are expressed as the mean   $\pm$  SD of three independent assays).

the viability of cells treated with compounds  13 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  21  and  22 – 26  was significantly improved (from   $60\%$   to more than   $80\%$  ,   $\mathrm{~P~}>$  0.001). In the analysis of compounds  1 – 10  comparing compound  2  and  compound  7 , compound  3  and compound  8 , and compound  4  and  compound  9 , we concluded that the substituent at the 5-position exerted  a better protective effect than the substituent at the 4-position. In the  comparison of compounds  1 – 3  and  4 – 6 , electron-donating groups have  more advantages than electron-withdrawing groups. A comparison of  the activities of compound  13  and compound  18 , compound  14  and  compound  19 , and compounds  17  and  20  revealed that the activity of  the substituent at the 4-position on the A ring is higher than the sub­ stituent at the 5-position. The 4-methoxy, 4-F,   $_{4-\mathrm{CF_{3}}}$  stituents on the A ring are all good substituents. After comparing  compounds  21 – 27  with compounds  11 – 20 , the di substituted compound  exerted a greater protective effect.  

# 3.3. Protective effects of compounds  13, 15 – 17, 21 – 26  with prominent  activities  

As shown in  Fig. 2 , compounds  13, 15-17, 21-26  were more active  than the remaining compounds. The protective efficacy of different  concentrations of compounds  13, 15-17, 21-26  were assessed using  MTT assays to further investigate and compare their potency. Pretreat­ ment with compounds  13, 15-17, 21-26  dose-dependent ly (2.5, 5, and   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M})$   increased the viability ( Fig. 3 ) and reduced SNP-induced cyto­ toxicity in PC12 cells. All of these compounds exerted substantial pro­ tective effects on SNP-induced cell death at   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M},$  , and the protective  effect decreased rapidly as the concentration decreased. Compound  24

was the most active of the compound, and the 4-fluorine substitution of  benzene ring A and benzene ring B was considered an effective phar­ maceutical group for neuro protection. Its structure is shown in  Fig. 4 .  

# 3.4. Cyto toxicity assay  

Cyto toxicity is a very important index for evaluating the pharma­ cochemical properties of compounds during the development of new  drugs. The cyto toxicity of the compounds toward LO2 cells and PC12  cells was measured by the MTT method (as shown in  Table 2 ). The  cyto toxicity values of compounds  13 ,  15 – 17 , and  21 – 26  ranged from 42   $\pm~11.12~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   to   $230.60\,\pm\,42.50\,\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   in LO2 cells. The   $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$    values of  compounds  15 ,  16 ,  23 ,  24 ,  and 25  were greater than 100, which was  considered as nontoxic to LO2 cells. For PC12 cells, the  $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$  values of  

compounds  15 ,  17 ,  24 ,  and 26  were greater than 100, indicating that  they are safe for PC12 cells. The   $\mathrm{IC}_{50}$  values of the other compounds    ranged from   $26.85\pm3.66$   to   $81.67\pm15.29$  . Based on the activity and  cyto toxicity, we selected compound  24  for further studies.

Early processes of apoptosis comprise cell shrinkage and pyknosis,  and nuclear pyknosis has been used as an indicator of apoptosis. SNP  was used to induce apoptosis as described in previous reports( Zhang  et al., 2017 ). Hoechst 33258 is a blue fluorescent dye used to stain DNA  ( Latt et al., 1975 ). As shown in  Fig. 5 A and B, compared with the control  group, the number of living cells in the SNP group decreased substan­ tially, and pre treatment with compound  24  (  $(10~\mathrm{~\textmuM~})$   effectively  increased the number of living cells. Regarding the morphology, the  cells in the control group showed a long strip-like shape, whereas the  cells in the injury group became rounded and shrunken (a sign of  apoptosis), and displayed nuclear condensation (brightening). The  morphology of the compound  24  group often appeared normal. The  aforementioned results show that compound 24 alleviates SNP-induced  apoptosis.  

We measured ROS levels using the peroxide-sensitive fluorescent  probe 2,7-di chlo rod i hydro fluoresce in diacetate (DCFH-DA). DCFH-DA  easily reaches the cytoplasm due to its good lip o solubility. It is hydro­ lysed to DCFH by esterase. DCFH was oxidized by intracellular ROS to  the green fluorescent molecule dich l oro fluoresce in (DCF). As shown in  Fig. 5 C, the green fluorescence density was significantly higher in the

Pretreated with com­ pound  24   $(10~\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for   $_{2\textrm{h}}$  ,   $500~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP was  added for another   $^{24\,\mathrm{~h~}}$  . Then   $12\;\;\upmu\mathrm{g/mL}$  Hoechst 33258 and   $20~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   DCFH-DA were  co-incubated for   $30\;\mathrm{~\min~}$  min. The tissue  morphology was observed in the bright field  (A). Apoptosis result (B) was detected by  laser confocal at excitation and emission  wavelengths of   $346\ \mathrm{nm}$   and   $460\ \mathrm{nm}$  . ROS  level (C) was detected by laser confocal  While excitation and emission wavelengths  were   $488~\mathrm{nm}$   and  $525~\mathrm{nm}$  .

After pretreated with compound  24   $(10~\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for  $^{2\,\mathrm{h}}$  ,   $500~\upmu\mathrm{M}$    SNP was added for another  $^{24\:\mathrm{h}}$  . Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by using JC-1 dye.  

SNP group than in the control group, while compound  24  remarkably  reduced the level of ROS in the SNP group. D is equilibrium between the  ROS produced and the antioxidants available to combat them leads to  the accumulation of ROS, which is associated with oxidative stress.  Based on these results, compound  24  may exert a cyto protective effect  by inhibiting ROS accumulation.

A number of scholars have identified mitochondria as a target for the  treatment of neuro degenerative diseases( Trovato Salinaro et al., 2018 ).  Since mitochondria are the energy supply center for electron transport  and oxidation reactions, mitochondria, the main intracellular source of  ROS production, are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage  ( Buglak et al., 2018 ). When mitochondria are damaged by free radicals,  the MMP will drop. A measurement of the MMP is the most direct and  simplest method to assess the function of mitochondria.   $^{5,5^{\prime},6,6^{\prime}}$  -Tet­ rachloro $^{1,1^{\prime},3,3^{\prime}}$  -tetraethyl-i mid a carbo cyan in e  (JC-1)  is  a  dye  commonly used to rapidly and sensitively detect changes in the MMP of  cells. In normal mitochondria( Xie et al., 2018 ), JC-1 aggregates to form  a polymer, emitting intense red fluorescence, while in unhealthy mito­ chondria, JC-1 exists as a monomer and produces green fluorescence due  to a decrease of the membrane potential. Since green fluorescence  indicates unhealthy mitochondria, a shift in fluorescence from red to  green indicates a reduction in the MMP. As illustrated in  Fig. 6 , red  fluorescence was more frequently observed in the normal group than  green fluorescence, suggesting that mitochondria were in a healthy  state. After treatment with SNP, cells with brighter green fluorescence  were observed, reflecting a decrease in the MMP. The conversion of the  fluorescence from green to red in the compound  24  group indicates that  the MMP was restored.  

# 3.7. Stoic hio me tries of compound  24 -Fe (II) complex  

Iron plays a vital role in various physiological functions and normal  brain function. However, high level of iron can lead to significant  oxidative damage via radical production within the brain, as in neuro­ degenerative diseases( Moos, 2002 ) and ischaemia ( Selim and Ratan,  2004 ). In order to research the Fe (II) chelation of compound  24 , the  difference spectrum method was used to evaluate the stoic hio metric

ratio of complex. As shown in  Fig. 7 A, there are three positive absorption  peaks at 231, 280 and  $328\,\mathrm{nm}$  . With the increase of molar ratio of Fe (II)  to compound  24 , the peak at 231, 280,   $328~\mathrm{nm}$   increased gradually.  When the molar ratio reaches a certain amount, the difference spectrum  no longer changes with the increase of molar ratio. Absorption peaks at   $231~\mathtt{n m}$   is the strongest, which can minimize the interference of com­ pound  24 . Therefore,  $231\,\mathrm{nm}$   was selected to evaluate the stoic hio metric  ratio of the complex In  Fig. 7 B, as the mole ratio of Fe (II) to compound  24  increased, the  Δ A first increased and then tended to be constant.  When the mole ratio of Fe (II) to compound  24  was equal to or more than  1:2, the curve became stable. Thence, it can be concluded that the  stoic hio metric ratio of compound  24 -Fe (II) complex was 2: 1.  

# 3.8. Compound  24  induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1  up regulation  

Nrf2 is a stress-responsive transcription factor and an important part  of the endogenous antioxidant defence system that protects cells from  oxidative damage( Schmoll et al., 2017 ). Nrf2 must trans locate into the  nucleus to exert its transcriptional function and regulate the expression  of antioxidants, including HO-1, GSH, and SOD, and others. Among  these antioxidants, HO-1 plays a central role in diminishing oxidative  insults; therefore, we further explored the effect of compound  24  on the  expression of Nrf2 and HO-1.  

Time-dependent changes in the expression levels of HO-1 and Nrf2  induced by compound  24  were examined to determine the proper time  for the pre treatment with compound  24  in PC12 cells. The expression  levels of HO-1 and Nrf2 showed a trend of first increasing and then  decreasing over time, and the protein expression reached the relatively  highest levels after PC12 cells were pretreated with compound  24  for 6 h  ( Fig. 8 A). Thus, we selected  $6\,\mathrm{h}$   as a suitable time point for further study.  The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used to down regulate the expression  of Nrf2 and elucidate whether Nrf2 was associated with the neuro­ protective effect of compound  24 . As displayed in  Fig. 8 B – D, LY294002  reduced the expression of   $\mathrm{Nrf}2$  . The Western blot analysis showed that  the decrease in Nrf2 levels induced by LY294002 was reversed by  compound  24 .  

Total cellular proteins and nuclear proteins were extracted after  treating cells with compound  24  for 6 h. As shown in  Fig. 8 E, the change  in total levels of the Nrf2 protein was not noticeable, while the level of  the nuclear Nrf2 protein was significantly increased. The quantitative  analysis showed ( Fig. 8 F and G) that compound  24  promotes the  translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus and potentially allows cells to resist  oxidative damage by regulating the location of Nrf2 protein. Thus,  compound  24  exerts neuro protective effects on PC12 cells via the Nrf2/  HO-1 pathway.  

# 3.9. Compound  24  improves neurological function and attenuates  cerebral ischemic injury  

We used a classic mouse cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion model to  study the p harm a co dynamic and protective effect of compound  24  on  acute ischemic stroke. We further evaluated the neuro protective activity  of compound  24  in vivo  in a rat model of transient focal cerebral  ischaemia induced by the intra lumina l occlusion of the middle cerebral  artery (MCAO), which is considered the most common cause of I/R-related brain injury in the clinic. Then,   $24\textup{h}$   after surgery, the neuro­ logical function of the animals was scored with Zea Longa ’ s 4-point

scoring system. As shown in  Fig. 9 , the neurological score of the model  group was significantly higher than the blank control group   $(\mathbf{P}<0.01)$  .  Compared with the model group, the scores of the animals treated with  the positive control drug and the middle dose of compound  24  were  significantly reduced   $\left(\mathrm{P}<0.05\right)$  . The infarct size of individual rats was  evaluated using 2,3,5-tri phenyl tetra zo liu m chloride (TTC) staining, one  of the most commonly used methods for reliable macroscopic identifi­ cation of infarcted tissue ( Kim et al., 2019 ). Compared with the cerebral  infarct area of the sham-operated group and the model-based control  group (sham-operated:   $0.00~\pm~0.00\%$  , model-based control group:   $25.73~\pm~7.53\%)$  , the cerebral infarct area in the positive control,  low-dose, middle-dose, and high-dose groups were significantly  decreased (positive control:   $13.78\pm9.12\%$  , low-dose:   $17.86\pm5.26\%$  ,  middle-dose:   $15.07\pm4.50\%$  , and high-dose:   $17.06\pm5.71\%$  ). The re­ sults are consistent with the neurological scores. In summary, although  the efficacy was not as good as that of the positive control edaravone, the  medium dose of compound  24  also exerted a good protective effect on  the MCAO model.  

# 3.10. Compound  24  influences the serum levels of biochemical indicators  in a rat MCAO model  

Ischaemic stroke causes decreased blood flow in the brain, a loss of  cellular integrity, and subsequent cellular damage, resulting in inflam­ mation( Amruta et al., 2020 ). TNF $\cdot\upalpha$    and  $\operatorname{L}{\mathfrak{g}}$    are inflammation-related  factors and serve as biomarkers of inflammation. In the process of  neuro inflammation after stroke, TNF $\cdot\upalpha$    and   $\operatorname{L}{\mathfrak{g}}$    levels increase signifi­ cantly. MDA is a product of lipid peroxides. Reactive oxygen species  degrade polyunsaturated lipids, forming malo ndi aldehyde ( Mueangson  et al., 2020 ). The production of this aldehyde is used as a biomarker to  measure the level of oxidative stress in an organism( Pryor and Stanley,  1975 ). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an antioxidant enzyme that  converts superoxide radicals   $(\mathbf{O}_{2}^{-})$  ) into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide,  which is an important antioxidant defence mechanism in the body( Ro  et al., 2020 ). Therefore,  $^{24\,\mathrm{h}}$   after the animals underwent the operation,  we collected blood from the animals to determine the serum levels of  IL-1 β , TNF ${\cdot\upalpha},$  , SOD and MDA. As shown in  Fig. 10 ,Compared with the  blank control group, serum levels of IL-1 β , TNF $\cdot\upalpha$  and MDA were  significantly increased in the model control group   $(\mathrm{P}<0.01)$  , and the  SOD content was significantly reduced   $\left(\mathrm{P}<0.05\right)$  . Compared with the  model control group, the test drug significantly reduced the serum IL $\cdot1\upbeta,$  ,  TNF $\cdot\upalpha$  , and MDA levels   $({\bf P}<0.01$   or   $\mathsf{P}<0.05.$  ), and significantly  increased the serum SOD level   $\left(\operatorname{P}<0.01\right)$  ).  

# 4. Conclusions  

We designed and synthesized 27 compounds with bisphenol  hydroxyl-substituted triazole or oxadiazole cores. Ten compounds ( 13 ,  15 – 17 , and  21-26 ) with neuro protective effects were first selected in the  SNP-induced PC12 cell apoptosis model at   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}.$  , and then a second  round of screening with a series of concentrations   $(2.5\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$  ,  $5\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   $\upmu\mathrm{M})$   was performed to evaluate their cyto toxicity. Among these com­ pounds, compound  24  exerted a significant neuro protective effect at 5 

  $\upmu\mathrm{M}$   (cell viability:   $77.02\,\pm\,2.00\%)$   and   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   (cell viability:   $96.85\ \pm$   $0.33\%$  ) on SNP-induced cell death and was generally nontoxic to PC12 

  $(105.6\pm2.90\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$   and LO2   $(188.7\pm16.33\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$   cells. Studies of its effect  on ameliorating ischemic stroke studies  in vivo  were performed in a rat  MCAO model. The middle and high doses of compound  24  significantly  reduced the cerebral infarct area (model-based control group:   $25.73\pm$   $7.53\%$  , middle-dose:   $15.07\,\pm\,4.50\%$  , and high-dose:   $17.06\,\pm\,5.71\%$  )  

# and the neurological score.  

Moreover, compound  24  alleviated SNP-induced apoptosis by  inhibiting ROS accumulation and restoring the mitochondrial mem­ brane potential and reduce the level of iron. It may confer protection to  PC12 cells from SNP insults by activating the Nrf2 antioxidant signalling  pathway. In addition, it also reduced the levels of the inflammatory  factors  $\operatorname{IL}–1\upbeta$    and TNF $\cdot\upalpha,$  , as well as MDA, and increased the level of the  antioxidant SOD. Compound  24  improves neurological function and  decrease cerebral infarct area in MCAO model. To sum up, compound  24  represents a promising neuro protect ant for the treatment of ischemic  stroke.
