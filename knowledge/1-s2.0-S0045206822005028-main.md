Keywords:  Acute ischemic stroke  1,2,4-triazole derivatives  Neuro protect ant  Antioxidant response element  

Acute ischemic stroke is an important cause of death and long-term disability worldwide. In this work, we have  synthesized a series of derivatives with 3,5 ‑ diaryl substituent triazole scaffolds. The derivatives showed favorable  protective effective in SNP-induced oxidative stress model, of which compound  5  was the most active. In vivo  experiments showed that compound  5  could ameliorate neurological deficits, attenuate infarction sizes, reduce  mal on aldehyde (MDA) level and increase superoxide dismutase (SOD) level in middle cerebral artery occlusion  (MCAO) rats. Preliminary safety evaluation showed that compound  5  exhibited low acute toxicity in   $\mathbf{BALB}/\mathbf{c}$  mice   $(\mathrm{LD}_{50}$  greater than   $1000~\mathrm{mg/kg})$  . Further investigation indicated that compound  5  was able to scavenge    ROS, restore mitochondrial membrane potential and protect PC12 cells from SNP-induced apoptosis. Moreover,  compound  5  could initiate transcription of antioxidant response element (ARE) and induced expressions of  anti oxidative enzymes. Collectively, compound  5  might have the potency of treating acute ischemic stroke.  

proteins to restore the redox balance. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related  factor 2 (Nrf2)- antioxidant response element (ARE) signal pathway is an  indispensable constituent of the anti oxidative system  [12,13] . ARE is a  cis -acting element that regulates the expressions of multiple antioxidant  enzymes, including Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone de­ hydrogen as e (NQO1) and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC)  [14,15] . In basic condition, the transcription activity of ARE was  repressed by the he t ero dimer of small mus cul o apo neurotic fi bro sarcoma  (sMaf) and Bach1  [16] . In stress condition, Nrf2 trans located into nu­ cleus, hence sMaf could bind with   $\mathrm{Nrf}2$   and initiate the transcription of  anti oxidative genes  [17] .  

# 1. Introduction  

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a neuro degenerative disease that can  cause death and long-term disability  [1,2] . During the pathology of  ischemic stroke, oxidative stress has been considered as an important  reason for neural damage  [3,4] . Excessive generation of ROS can lead to  lipid per oxidation, damage of DNA  [5]  and proteins and induce  apoptosis of nerve cells  [6] . Th rom bec to my and thr ombo lysis are the  main treatment for ischemic stroke  [7] , but the narrow therapeutic  window has limited their clinical employments  [8] . Recently, devel­ oping neuro protective agents with antioxidant effect is considered as a  promising method for the treatment of ischemic stroke  [9,10] . For  example, edaravone is a neuro protect ant that can scavenge free radicals  in brain tissues and protect brain from ischemic injury  [11] .  

Recently, triazole derivatives were found to show favorable neuro­ protective effect in vitro and in vivo. MIND4-17, a triazole derivative,  could activate Nrf2-ARE signal pathway and induced expressions of  NQO1, GCLC and NADPH in human Huntington ’ s disease neural stem  cells  [18] . Rosaria and coworkers reported a neuro protect ant with 1,2,4-  

Under oxidative stress condition, endogenous defense system was  activated and subsequently up regulated expressions of cyto protective  

trizole core, which could ameliorate motor deficits in Parkinson ’ s dis­ ease model  [19] .  

In our previous work, a 1,3,5-substituent triazole derivative (SYS18)  was able to activate Nrf2-ARE signal pathway by promoting nuclear  translocation of   $\mathrm{Nrf}2$  , subsequently protecting PC12 cells from SNP-induced oxidative damage and attenuating the cerebral ischemic  injury in MCAO rats  [20] . Another triazole derivative (CYS 32) also have  the ability of Nrf2 activation, which could promote expressions of ARE-dependent anti oxidative enzymes and exhibited favorable neuro­ protective effects in vivo and in vitro  [21] . These researches demon­ strated that 3,5 ‑ diaryl triazole might be a favorable scaffold for  developing neuro protect ants.

Herein, we have extended a series of 3,5 ‑ diaryl substituent triazole  derivatives to explore their potential neuro protective effect. The activ­ ities of compounds were preliminarily evaluated by SNP-induce oxida­ tive damage model in PC12 cells. The optimal compound was further  investigated for the acute toxicity in BALB/c mice and therapeutic effect  against ischemic stroke in MCAO model. Moreover, the anti oxidative  mechanism was investigated by evaluating the potency of ROS elimi­ nation and mitochondrial trans membrane potential restoration. The  ability of activating Nrf2-ARE signal pathway was determined by ARE-luciferase reporter activity and western blotting.

# 2.3. Biological evaluation  

# 2.3.1. Cell cultures  

The rat adrenal phe och romo cyto ma cell lines (PC12) were purchased  from the Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University  (Guangzhou, China). PC12 cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM  medium containing  $5\;\%$   (v/v) horse serum (Gibco, USA) and  $5\;\%$   (v/v)  fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA). The cells were cultured in the atmo­ sphere of  $5~\%~{\tt C O}_{2}$    at  $37\ ^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  .  

Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) was ob­ tained from Saiku Biotechnology (Guangzhou, China). The HepG2 cells  were trans fec ted with ARE-minP-luciferase-hPEST reporter construct.  The HepG2 cells were cultured in MEM medium containing   $10~\%$   (v/v)  fetal bovine serum. The cells were cultured in the atmosphere of  $5\,\%\,{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$  at  $37~^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  .  

# 2.3.2. Measurement of cell viability  

Cell viability was tested by MTT assay. Briefly, PC12 cells were  seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The cells were pretreated  with different concentrations of compounds   $(1\,\upmu\mathrm{M},5\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$  , and  $10\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for   $^{2\,\mathrm{h}}$  , followed by addition of   $400~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for incubation for   $24\textup{h}$  . Eda­ varone was used as positive control and the control group was treated  without disposition of compounds. Subsequently,   $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of MTT was  added for incubation at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $3\,\mathrm{h}$  . The super nat ant was then replaced  by  $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of DMSO in each well of the plates. The solutions were mixed  thoroughly under shaking. The absorbances (OD values) were measured  at   $570\ \mathrm{nm}$   with Synergy H microplate reader (BioTek Devices). The  experiments were repeated for three times.  

# 2.3.3. Acute toxicity test  

BALB/c mice (18 – 22 g) were obtained from the Experimental Animal  Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). All procedures  were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care Committee, and  were adhered to the standard guidelines of laboratory animals. The mice  were administrated with   $1000~\mathrm{mg/kg}$   compound  5  by intra peritoneal  injection and were observed for death status and physiological index,  including appearance, behavior, secretions and excreta.  

# 2.3.4. Establishment of a rat model of ischemic stroke  

Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats   $(200{-}230\:g)$   were obtained from the  Experimental Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou,  China). The rats were divided into 6 groups with 12 in each group: Sham  group; MCAO group (model group);   $\mathsf{M C A O\,+\,3\ m g/k g}$   compound  5  group; MCAO  +  6 mg/kg compound  5  group; MCAO  +  $\textsuperscript{-12m g/k g}$  compound  5  group; MCA  $.0\ +\ 6\ \,\mathrm{m}g/\mathrm{kg}$   edaravone group (positive  control).  

The procedures of MCAO experiment were performed according to  the previous literature  [22] . At first, the rats were anesthetized by   $4\;\%$  isoflurane and fixed to the operating table. A midline neck incision was  made to isolated the left common carotid artery and the external and  internal carotid arteries. The internal carotid artery was temporarily  clipped with a hemostatic clamp. A 4 – 0 nylon thread was introduced to  the common carotid artery after a small incision was made. The clamp  was then removed and the nylon thread was inserted to the intersection  of anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery. The blood supply  of forebrain and midbrain was occluded for  $1.5\,\mathrm{h}$   before the thread was  retracted to restore cerebral perfusion. The compounds or saline were  intra peritoneal ly injected at 1 h before the surgery and   $4\,\mathrm{h}$   after reper­ fusion. The rats in the sham group undertook the same operation with  the experimental groups except for arterial occlusion.  

# 2.3.5. Measurement of neurological deficits  

The Longa ’ s neurological tests were performed to evaluate the  neurological deficits of rats after   $^{24\textup{h}}$   of reperfusion. The degree of  neurological deficiency was quantified as follows: 0 points, no observ­ able deficit; 1 point, can not fully extend the contra lateral forelimb; 2  points, turning circles to the left; 3 points, hemiplegia; and 4 points, loss  of consciousness.  

2.3.6. Measurement of biochemical indicators and cerebral infarct area  

After measurement of neurological deficits, the whole-blood samples  were collected from the abdominal vein. The serum was obtained from  cent ri fuga tion of blood samples and kept at   $-20\ {\mathrm{}}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}.$  . Superoxide dis­ mutase (SOD) and malo ndi aldehyde (MDA) were tested by detection kits  (Beyotime, China).  

The rats were sacrificed to extract the whole brains. The olfactory  bulbs and cerebellums of whole brains were removed and the cerebrums  were collected. The cerebrums were frozen at   $-20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,\mathtt{m i n}$   before  slicing into five coronal sections. The slices were incubated with   $1\ \%$  TTC at   $37~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $20\;\mathrm{min}$   and kept in   $4\;\%$   para formaldehyde overnight.  The samples were photographed, and the infarction sizes were quanti­ fied via ImageJ software.  

# 2.3.7. Hoechst 33,258 and DCFH-DA staining assay  

PC12 cells were seeded in laser confocal dishes and cultured for  $^{24\,\mathrm{h}}$  .  The cells were pre incubated with   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   compound  5  for   $2\:\mathrm{h},$  , followed  by treatment of  $400~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for   $24\textup{h}$  . Afterward, the super nat ant was  replaced with serum-free medium containing   $12~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   $(12\,\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{mL})$   or  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of DCFH-DA   $(20\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$  . Cells were stained at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{min}$   before washing with serum-free medium for three times. The  relative fluorescence intensities were detected by fluorescence micro­ scope (Olympus, FV3000, Japan).

# 2.3.10. Western blot analysis  

PC12 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for   $24\textup{h}$  , fol­ lowed by treatment of different concentrations of compound  5  (10, 5,   $2.5\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$   for  $_{3\,\mathrm{h}}$  . The super nat ant was removed and the cells were washed  with PBS for 2 times.  $40~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of RIPA lysis buffer was added to each well  and the cells were lysed at   $0~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{min}$  . The lysis buffers were  collected and centrifuged at  $12{,}000~\mathrm{rpm/min}$   for   $10\ \mathrm{min}$   to collect the  whole-cell proteins. The concentration of protein was measured by a  bic inchon in ic acid (BCA) assay kit.  

The proteins were separated by   $10~\%$   SDS-PAGE before transferring  onto polyvinyl ide ne fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were  soaked in  $5\,\%$   skim milk solution at room temperature for  $2\,\mathrm{h}$   and then  incubated with primary antibody at   $4\ \mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   overnight [HO-1 primary  antibody (1:1000), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase (NQO1) primary  antibody (1:1000),   $\upbeta$  -actin antibody (1:1000)]. The membranes were  treated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000) for  $_{1\,\mathrm{h}}$   followed by  staining with Electro chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate. The protein  bands were detected by automated chemiluminescence imaging analysis  system (Tanon 5200, China) and quantified via ImageJ.  

2.4. Statistical analysis  

GraphPad Prism 8.0 software was used for statistical analysis. The  biological measurements in vitro were performed for three times.  Experimental results in vivo were analyzed via a single-factor analysis of  variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett ’ s test. The results are reported as the  means  $\pm$   standard deviations (SD).  $\tt P<0.05$   was considered statistically  significant.

First, salic yl amide and salicylic acid derivative were reacted with thi­ onyl chloride and pyridine in anhydrous xylene to obtain intermediates.  Then the target compounds were synthesized by reaction between the  intermediate and hydrazine derivatives. The products were purified to  ensure the purity (greater than   $95~\%$  , HPLC) before biological evalua­ tion. The structures of target compounds were identified by using   $\mathrm{^{1}H}$  NMR,   $^{13}\mathrm{C}$   NMR and HRMS.  

# 3.2. Screening of neuro protective effects and SAR analysis  

Oxidative stress is an important reason for neural damage during  ischemic stroke, leading to per oxidation of intracellular constituents and  dysfunction of organelles. Sodium nitro prussi de (SNP) was used to  induce oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells to mimic the  neuronal oxidative damage in vitro  [23] . Edaravone was a free radical  scavenger which excellent anti oxidative effect  [24] , which was used as  positive control. As shown in  Fig. 1 , the cell viability decreased to nearly   $60~\%$   after exposure to   $400~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   SNP for   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . After pre treatment with  different concentrations of compounds, the cell vi abilities increased  dose-dependent ly, indicating that the triazole derivatives exerted neu­ ro protective effects against SNP-induced oxidative damage. As shown in  Fig. 1 , most of triazole derivatives could significantly improve PC12 cell  viability at 5 and   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M};$  , indicating that most of triazole compounds  possessed favorable protective effects.  

In the previous research, we have investigated the SAR of various  substituents on the phenol ring. The results showed that the compounds  with one substituents at 4-position possessed better protective effects  than those that were simultaneously substituted with groups at salicylic  acid unit and salic yl amide unit. Two hydroxy substituents which were  fixed at the  ortho -position could chelate the overload   $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$    and have

better effect in scavenging free radical and neuro protection. Moreover,  we have also found that when the  $\mathrm{{CF_{3}}}$    and  $\mathrm{OCH}_{3}$    groups were substituted  at 4-position, the derivatives have better biological activity  [20] .  Although we have discovered some active compounds with 1,3,5 ‑ triaryl  triazole structure in previous research, we also found that those com­ pounds possessed low water-solubility, probably due to the hydropho­ bicity of three benzene ring  [21] . Therefore, we tried to replace the  benzene with other substituents on the triazole ring. We have chosen  some alkyl groups for preliminary investigation, which could preserve  the lip oph ili city to an extent for membrane permeability. And we also  extended the substituents with some hydrophilic groups to study the  activity.  

As shown in  Table 1 , among the compounds substituted with tri­ flu oro methyl at   $\mathtt{R}_{1}$    position (compound  1 – 11 ), compound  5  with tri­ flu oro ethyl group possessed the best cyto protective activity, followed by  compound  1  with isopropyl group. Moreover, the aromatic substituents  were likely to possess favorable anti oxidative effects. For example,  Compound  8 ,  10  and  11  were able to increased the cell viability to more  than  $90~\%$   at  $5~{\upmu}{\mathrm{M}}$  .  

To further investigate the structure activity relationship of sub­ stituents  $\mathsf{R}_{1}$    position, compound  12 – 19  were synthesized. When  $\mathtt{R}_{1}$    was  substituted by methoxy group, compounds with tri flu oro ethyl and  cy cl open tyl at   $\mathtt{R}_{2}$    position were likely to have better neuro protective  effects, which could improve cell viability up to  $90\,\%$  . When  $\mathtt{R}_{1}$  position    was occupied by chlorine, the derivatives possessed favorable protective  effects, among which compound  19  could increased the cell viability to  nearly   $100\;\%$  .  

In summary, compounds with tri flu oro methyl group and chlorine at   $\mathtt{R}_{1}$    position were likely to have better neuro protective effects. In addi­ tion, tri flu oro ethyl at   $\mathtt{R}_{2}$    position were beneficial to the bioactivity.  Among the derivatives, compound  5  possessed the excellent protective  effect and was selected for further biological evaluation.  

# 3.3. Evaluation of physico chemical properties and acute toxicity of  compound  5  

According to the drug-like properties proposed by Lipinski, the mo­ lecular weight of compounds is suggested to be   ${<}500$  ; the number of  hydrogen donor is no more than 5; the number of hydrogen receptor is  no more than 10; the number of rotatable bond is no more than 10; the  Log P is between   $2\sim5$  . In order to preliminarily explore the drug-like  properties of compound  5 , we used SwissADME  [25]  to calculate  various chemical parameters. As shown in  Table 2 , compound  5  basi­ cally conformed to the rules of drug-like molecules.  

To further evaluate the safety profile, compound  5  was assessed for  acute toxicity by intra peritoneal injection in BALB/c mice ( Table 3 ).  After administration with compound  5 , the mice were observed for  survival quantities and the status of appearance, behavior and excreta.  There were no observable loss of weight or side-effects on day 2 and day  7 after administration. The animals could tolerate treatment with 1000   $\mathbf{m}\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{kg}$   of compound  5 , indicating the low acute toxicity of compound 5  in vivo.

MMP was detected by JC-1 staining after the PC12 cells  were treated with  $10\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   compound  5  for  $_{2\,\mathrm{h}}$   and exposed to SNP for  $^{24\,\mathrm{h}}$  . JC-1 aggregates (Red) were measured in the wavelength (  $\mathbf{\tilde{E}x}=585\,\mathbf{nm}$  ,  $\mathrm{pm}=590\,\mathrm{nm}.$  ). JC-1 monomers (Green) were measured in the wavelength   $(\mathrm{E}\mathbf{x}=514\;\mathrm{nm}$  ,   $\mathbf{Em}=529\ \mathbf{nm}^{\cdot}$  ).

assessment of therapeutic effect against acute ischemic stroke  [26,27] .  Compound  5  was further investigated for neuro protective effect in  MCAO model and edaravone was used as positive control. After reper­ fusion for   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  , the rats were scored by Zea longa ’ s tests to determined  the neurological deficits.  

As shown in  Fig. 2 , the behavioral scores markedly increased in the  MCAO group   $(2.06~\pm~0.53)$  , indicating occlusion of cerebral artery  induced neurological deficits in rats. Compared with the model group,  the scores decreased after treatment with different dosages of compound  5 , but there is no significance in low   $(1.83\,\pm\,0.50)$   and medium-dose  group   $(1.77\pm0.34)$  . Administration with high dosage of compound  5  could significantly reduce behavioral scores in MCAO rats   $(1.50\pm0.47)$  ,  whose effect was similar to that of edaravone   $(1.44\pm0.49)$  . The results  indicated that compound  5  was able to reduce neurological deficits  induced by cerebral infarction.  

# 3.5. Compound  5  reduced infarct sizes in MCAO rats

shown in  Fig. 3 , the infarct size significantly increased after cerebral  artery occlusion   $(24.59\pm6.75\ \%)$  ), indicating establishment of MCAO  model. Treatment with compound  5  could reduce infarction compared  with MCAO group. The therapeutic effects of the medium   $\phantom{0}{16.68\pm4.80}$   $\%$  ) and high-dose   $(14.03\pm6.61\ \%)$   group were similar to the that of  edaravone   $35.74\,\pm\,5.04\ \%)$  . The results suggested that compound  5  could attenuated cerebral ischemic injury in vivo.  

3.6. Compound  5  improved the expression levels of serum biochemical  indicators in vivo  

In the pathology of ischemic stroke, imbalance of redox system leads  to oxidative injury of tissues and organs. To further investigate the  anti oxidative effect of compound  5  in vivo, the rat serums were collected  to detect the the levels of malo ndi aldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dis­ mutase (SOD). MDA is a product of lipid per oxidation that could reflect  the status of oxidative stress in vivo  [28] . As shown in  Fig. 4 , treatment  with compound  5  could significantly reduced MDA level in serum. SOD  is an important antioxidant enzyme that can scavenge superoxide anion  free radicals  [29] . Treatment with compound  5  could significantly in­ crease SOD level in serum. The results indicated that compound  5  possessed anti oxidative effect in vivo, which might contribute to the  therapeutic effect against cerebral ischemic injury.  

3.7. Compound  5  protected cells from SNP-induced apoptosis and  suppressed the accumulation of ROS  

Nuclear pyknosis is an important feature of apoptosis that can be  detected by Hoechst 33,258 staining  [30] . Hoechst 33,258 is a blue  fluorescent dye that can permeate the cell membrane and combine with  DNA in nucleus. As shown in  Fig. 5 D-F, the nucleus was in incompact  and round shape and exhibited dark blue fluorescence in normal con­ dition. After being exposed to SNP, the nucleus shrunk and the fluo­ rescent signal was enhanced, indicating SNP could induce apoptosis in  PC12 cells. Treatment with compound  5  was able to reduced the fluo­ rescence and shrinkage of the nucleus, which is similar to the status of  normal cells. The results indicated that compound  5  could protected  PC12 cells from SNP-induced apoptosis.  

Excessive generation of ROS is a leading cause of oxidative stress  during ischemic stroke, which may induce damage of cellular lipid,  protein and DNA. 2,7-di chlo rod i hydro fluoresce in (DCFH) is a green  fluorescent dye that can detect ROS level in cells  [31] . As shown in  Fig. 5 G-I, exposure to SNP significantly increased green fluorescence  compared with control group, indicating excessive generation of ROS. In  the group pretreated with   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   compound  5 , low fluorescent signal  was observed, which is similar to the phenomenon of control group. The  results indicated that compound  5  could reduce generation of ROS in  PC12 cells and consequently protect the cells from oxidative damage.  

# 3.8. Compound  5  restored mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)  

Mitochondria is an essential organelle to maintain normal physio­ logical activities. Mitochondria dysfunction is involved in the neuronal  damage in ischemic stroke pathology  [32] . Mitochondrial membrane  potential is a widely used indicator for detection of mitochondria  damage. In this experiment, JC-1 fluorescent probe was used for mea­ surement of MMP  [33] . At the status of high MMP, JC-1 accumulates in  the matrix of the mitochondria to form aggregates, which can emit red  fluorescence. At the status of mitochondria dysfunction, the MMP  decreased and JC-1 dispersed in the matrix as monomers to form green  fluorescence.  

As shown in  Fig. 6 , the cells were stained red in normal condition. At  the presence of SNP, MMP was reduced because of the impairment of  mitochondria, leading to decreasing of red fluorescence and increasing  of green fluorescence. In the group treated with compound  5 , the red  fluorescent signal was high while the green signal was low, suggesting a  restoration of MMP. The results indicated that compound  5  was able to  maintain the mitochondrial homeostasis under stress condition.  

# 3.9. Activation of ARE-relative luciferase in HepG-2 cells  

Under stress condition, Nrf2 was released from the ubiquitin ation of  Kelch like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) and trans located from  cytoplasm to nucleus  [12] . In the nucleus, ARE is activated by  $\mathrm{Nrf}2$   and  subsequently initiate the transcription the anti oxidative genes  [34] . To  further investigate the mechanism of anti oxidation, compound  5  was  evaluated for the potency of activating ARE by luciferase reporter assay  in HepG2-ARE cells. As shown in  Table 4 , compound  5  dose-dependent ly  increased the induction of ARE. The results showed that compound  5  displayed more than 4.5-folod induction at   $100~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  , indicating that  compound  5  might exert anti oxidative effect by ARE activation. How­ ever, the ARE-inducing activity of compound  5  was less potent than the  covalent   $\mathrm{Nrf}2$   activator  t -BHQ. Because   $\mathrm{Nrf}2$   was the key regulator of  ARE and previous researches reported that 1,3,5 ‑ triaryl substituted tri­ azole derivatives could induce nuclear translocation of   $\mathrm{Nrf}2$  and pro­ mote expressions of ARE-dependent proteins. It provided a clue that  compound  5  might have the potential of affecting Nrf2 and initiate the  transcription of ARE  [20,21] .  

# 3.10. Compound  5  influences expressions of ARE-dependent enzymes  

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an ARE-dependent enzyme that can  degrade free heme and scavenge radicals in cells. As shown in  Fig. 7 ,  compound  5  was able to dose-dependent ly upregulate the expression of  HO-1 in PC12 cells. NAD(P)H quinone ox ido reductase 1 (NQO1) is also a  cyto protective enzymes regulated by ARE  [35] . NQO1 can reduce the  quinone to hydro quin ol and protect cells from oxidative damage.  Fig. 7  showed that treatment with compound  5  could increase the intracellular  NQO1 level. The results indicated that compound  5  had the capacity of  promoting expressions of ARE-dependent enzymes, which may  contribute to its anti oxidative effect and protect cells from oxidative  stress.  

# 4. Conclusion  

In this work, we have synthesized a series of 3,5 ‑ diaryl substituent  triazole derivatives and evaluated their neuro protective effect. In vitro  experiments showed that most of compounds could protect PC12 cells  from SNP-induced oxidative damage. Among the derivatives, compound  5  was the most active. In vivo experiments showed that compound  5  possessed low acute toxicity in BALB/c mice. Moreover, compound  5  was able to alleviate neurological deficits, reduce infarct sizes and  maintain redox balance in MCAO rats. Further investigation indicated  that compound  5  could suppress apoptosis and accumulation of ROS  induced by SNP. In addition, compound  5  could restore mitochondrial  membrane potential in PC12 cells. Compound  5  had the potency of  increasing induction of ARE and promoting expressions of HO-1 and  NQO1, which might contribute to the neuro protective effect. In sum­ mary, compound  5  might be a potential anti oxidative neuro protect ant  for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.
