# ABSTRACT  

# ARTICLE HISTORY  

Stroke is a common disease with high mortality and morbidity. It is of high importance to  identify biomarkers of stroke. Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor(GEF) 10  (ARHGEF10)   gene polymorphism has been found to be associated with various human diseases, but its  correlation with stroke remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate the potential association  of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of  ARHGEF10  with ischemic stroke (IS) in northern  Han Chinese population. Three SNPs of  ARHGEF10  gene were analyzed in 385 IS patients and  362 hypertension control patients using the ligase detection reaction (LDR) method. Logistic  regression analysis demonstrated that GG genotypes of SNP rs2280887 were associated with an  increased risk of IS in dominant, recessive, and additive models. Moreover, SNP rs9657362 and  SNP rs4480162 were significantly associated with IS in dominant and additive models. These  results indicate that  ARHGEF10  gene polymorphisms may affect IS risk in northern Han Chinese.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a common disease with very high mortality and  morbidity, but there are no effective approaches for the  prevention and treatment of stroke.[ 1–3 ] It is thus very  urgent to find novel methods to prevent and treat stroke. [ 4 ] Multiple factors have been found to be correlated  with stroke, including age, gender, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a, obesity, smoking, poor  eating habits.[ 3 , 5 ] In addition, though there is currently  no typical genetic model of stroke, accumulating data  from studies in animals and humans have indicated  that the incidence and prognosis of stroke is associated  with the genetic background of an individual.[ 3,6–8 ]  Flossmann et al. found that the risk rate of a person with  a family history of stroke is up to  $30\%$  .[ 9 ] It is now widely  believed that stroke is a complex disease that results from  environmental and genetic factors.[ 10 ]  

Emerging data suggest that the role of genetic ­factors  may vary in different types of stroke. Schulz et al. found  that the influence of genetics on card i oem boli c stroke  is relatively small, while thrombotic and hemorrhagic  strokes are highly affected by genetic factors.[ 14 ] At  present, most genetic studies of stroke focus on the  identification of gene single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNP) in full stroke (regardless of types) or ischemic  stroke (IS).[ 2 , 3 ]. Several stroke susceptibility genes have  been identified, such as coagulation/fi bri no ly tic system-­ related genes, lipoprotein gene, renin-angiotensin ­system  ( ACE )-related gene, endo the li al nitric oxide synthase  ( NO ), methylene tetra hydro folate reductase ( MTHFR ),  brain na tr iure tic peptide ( BNP ), protein kinase  $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{C}}\left(P\boldsymbol{K}\boldsymbol{\mathrm{C}}\right)$  ,  PDE4D , and  ALOX5AP. [ 2 , 3 ] In recent years, with the  advance of genomewide association study (GWAS),  many new SNPs have been found to be associated with  stroke. For example, rs11833579 of  WNK  and rs12425791  of  NINJ2  are closely associated with Asian stroke and  ischemic stroke, respectively.[ 15 ] However, the role of  these candidate genes in stroke is far from understanding.  For example, it remains unknown why a candidate gene  plays a pathogenic role or protective effect of stroke.  

The current prevention and treatment of stroke is  involved in the intervention of environmental factors,  such as control of hypertension and smoking, increasing exercise and improving other unhealthy lifestyles. [ 3 ] Genetic factors may be involved in stroke at multiple levels.[ 2 , 3 ] It is possible that gene polymorphism is  an independent risk factor for stroke, thereby an individual with a certain gene polymorphism may be more  susceptible to stroke and resistant to drug intervention.

ARHGEF10  gene, encoding Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor 10, is located on chromosome 8p23  and is highly expressed [ 16 ] in human tissues. It has  been reported that  ARHGEF10  gene polymorphism is  associated with demyelination,[ 17 ] neuro psychiatric  diseases,[ 18 ] and paclitaxel chemotherapy-induced  peripheral neuropathy.[ 19 ]  ARHGEF10  is mainly  involved in the regulation of Rho protein signal transduction and deregulation of RhoA-RhoGTP signaling  plays an important role in cerebral arteriosclerosis.[ 16 ]  A recent study has found that  ARHGEF10  gene polymorphism may be associated with atherosclerosis stroke  in Japanese [ 20 ] and Caucasian.[ 21 ] However, it remains  to be determined whether  ARHGEF10  gene polymorphism is associated with atherosclerosis stroke in other  populations such as Chinese.  

In this study, we investigated the  ARHGEF10  SNPs  in 385 ischemic stroke patients and 362 hypertension  patients without stroke.  

# Subjects and methods  

# Subjects  

A cohort of 747 individuals, including 385 patients with  ischemic stroke and 362 patients with hypertension but  no stroke, were included in this study. The ischemic  stroke group was composed of 297 Han patients with  ischemic stroke found during the epidemiological investigation of Fuxin rural areas (Liaoning province, China)  between 2004 and 2006,[ 22 ] and 88 diagnosed ischemic  stroke patients in our hospital. The total 385 ischemic  patients were diagnosed in accordance with WHO  standards of thrombotic patients with cerebral infarction, generally with the presence of neurological abnormalities. The diagnosis of thrombotic cerebral infarction  was confirmed by CT and/or MRI. The control group  consisted of 362 patients within the same population of  ischemic stroke group with matched gender and ethnic  during the epidemiological survey. Physical examination  found these control patients had hypertension with no  history of stroke and other abnormalities. These control  patients did not undergo CT or MRI and other imaging studies. The stroke-free patients were controlled for  smoking, drinking, blood sugar, cholesterol, obesity and  other indicators during the selection. The exclusion criteria were as following: there was no blood relationship  between the selected subjects and the selected subjects  had no coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction,  carotid and peripheral arterial stenosis, atrial arrhythmias, cancer, or trauma. The participants were genetically not related in three generations. After providing  informed consent,  $5\,\mathrm{{ml}}$   venous blood was obtained from  each participant and kept at  $-20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  until analysis. This  study was approved by the ethics committee of China  Medical University. The basic information of the selected  subjects is listed in Table  1 .  

# SNP selection and genotyping  

Genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA anticoagulated whole blood in Experimental Center and Virology  Laboratory of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical  University using TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (Tiangen  Biochemical Technology, Beijing, China) according to manufacturer’s protocols. We used Tag SNP strategies to select  the following three potential functional SNPs of  ARHGEF10   gene from the dbSNP and HapMap databases: rs2280887  (CT TG ACT C TT GG GC AGT TTT A A GTA[C/G] G TTT AAAA TTC TC CCG CT GCC A GAC, chromosome  8:1907598; functional consequence: intron variant),  rs9657362 (C TTC TC TT GAG GAA GAA CA GAA TTT [C/G]TTC AT TG AT GT TG ACT GC A A GC ACC, chromo- some: 8:1885635; functional consequence: missense), and  rs4480162  (TC A GAG TTC A GAGA AG GT GG AT GT G  [C/G]AG TTC A CAC TAAG GAG T CCG ACT CC, chro- mosome: 8:1906649; functional consequence: intron variant). The minor allele frequency (MAF) of these SNPs  was greater than 0.1 and pairwise   $r^{2}$   was more than 0.8.  Ligase detection reaction (LDR) method was used for  genotyping as previously described.[ 23–26 ] Primers  were designed with primer 5 and probes were designed  by Shanghai Generay Biotech ( http://www.generay.com.  ${\sf c n}/{\sum_{\alpha}}$  ). Allele and genotype frequencies were determined  by analyzing the raw data from ABI 3730XL with Peak  Scanner Software v1.0 (ABI). To ensure quality control,  genotyping was done without knowledge of case/control  status of the subjects, and a  $10\%$   random sample of cases  and controls was genotyped twice by different persons; the  reproducibility was   $100\%$  .  

# Statistical analysis  

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for  Windows software (version 13.0; SPSS, Chicago,  IL, USA) and SHEsis platform. Data are presented  as mean   $\pm$   standard deviation (S.D.) with normal

distribution by using the t test. Count data are ­presented  as number of cases and percentage and analyzed using  chi-square  $\chi^{2}$   test. Comparison and analysis of genotype and allele frequencies between cases and controls  were performed using Pearson   $\chi^{2}$   test. The genotype  frequencies were tested for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using  $\chi^{2}$   test. SHEsis statistical analysis  platform was used to compute haplotype frequencies and linkage d is equilibrium coefficient   $\mathrm{{}^{\prime}D^{\prime}}$   and   $r^{2}$  ). Associations between gene polymorphisms and  ischemic stroke risk were estimated by computing odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals   $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   from unconditional logistic regression models. Following adjusting for age, systolic blood pressure,  diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, smoking  and drinking history, triglycerides, high-density lipid  cholesterol, low-density lipid cholesterol and fasting  plasma glucose, multivariate analysis was evaluated by  logistic regression analysis to test the association of  gene variation and ischemic stroke risk.  $P<0.05$   was  considered statistically significant.  

# Results  

# Subject characteristics  

The characteristics of 385 ischemic stroke cases and 362  controls with hypertension are summarized in Table  1 .  There were no significant differences between cases  and controls for gender, heart rate, and total cholesterol  levels. As expected, the prevalence of the most common risk factors for atherosclerosis were significantly  different between cases and controls: body mass index  (  $\textstyle P=0.006)$  ), triglycerides   $\textstyle P=0.006)$  ), high-density lipid  cholesterol   $(P\,<\,0.001)$  ), low-density lipid cholesterol  (  $\textstyle P<0.001)$  ), and fasting plasma glucose   $\!\ {\cal P}=0.035,$  ).  

# Association between SNPs and ischemic stroke risk  

The genotype distributions of  ARHGEF10  rs2280887,  rs9657362, and rs4480162 between cases and controls  and their associations with ischemic stroke are summarized in Table  2 . The risk analysis of these variations in  stoke patients and control subjects was tested according to  recessive, additive, and dominant models. Because some  conventional confounding risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyper lipid emi a, may also contribute to the development of stroke, we also analyzed the  associations between these SNPs and IS after adjusting for  these factors. The allele frequencies of  ARHGEF10  gene  polymorphisms in controls and cases and their associations with ischemic stroke are shown in Table  3 .  

In the logistic regression models, compared with CC  genotype of rs2280887, CG and GG genotypes were  associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke 

 (OR 1.625,   $95\%$   CI 1.154–2.287 for CG,   $P=0.005$  ; OR 

 3.521,  $95\%$   CI 1.134–10.933 for GG,   $P=0.029$  , respectively). Under recessive, additive and dominant models,  rs2280887 was associated with IS (OR and  $95\%$   CI 3.128  (1.010–9.682),  $P=0.048$  ; 1.688 (1.252–2.275),  $P=0.001$  ;  and 1.725 (1.237–2.404)   $P=0.001$  , respectively. After  adjusting for stroke risk factors, the associations still  existed (OR and  $95\%$   CI 4.874 (1.181–20.113),  $P\,{=}\,0.028$  ;  1.787 (1.205–2.650),  $P=0.004\$   and 1.773 (1.134–2.771)   $P=0.012$  , respectively. The G allele was associated with  ischemic stroke risk with OR of 1.696 (  $95\%$   CI 1.259– 2.284,  $P<0.001$  ). These data indicate that the G allele  of rs2280887 is a risk factor for stroke.  

The C allele of rs9657362 was not associated with  ischemic stroke risk with OR of 0.817 (  $95\%$   CI 0.647– 1.031,   $P\,=\,0.088_{,}$  ). After adjusting for stroke risk factors, the genotype variations of rs9657362 was found  to be associated with IS under additive and dominant

Note: Frequency of  $<\!0.03$   were not included in the analysis. a The order of SNPs in  ARHGEF10  is rs2280887, rs9657362 and rs4480162.

models (OR(  $95\%$   CI): 0.715(0.522–0.980),  $P\,{=}\,0.037$   and  0.607(0.406–0.908),  $P=0.015$  , respectively).  

In the logistic regression models, we found no association of G allele of SNP rs 4480162 with ischemic stroke  risk with OR of 0.755   $(95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=0.559{-}1.019$  ,  $P=0.066$  ).  While the genotype variation of rs4480162 was found to  be associated with IS under dominant model (OR and   $95\%$   CI 0.701 (0.502–0.978),  $P=0.037.$  ). After adjusting  for stroke risk factors, the association was found under  both additive and dominant models (OR   $\cdot95\%$   CI):   $0.550(0.360–0.841)$  ,   $P=0.006$   and   $0.490(0.308–0.780)$  ,   $P=0.003\$  , respectively). It suggests the variation of SNP  rs 4480162 is a preventive factor of IS.  

# Haplotype analysis  

We further analyzed the distribution of haplotypes in  cases and controls. The haplotypes with frequencies  greater than  $0.03\%$   were shown in Table  4 . Three haplotypes were constructed in  ARHGEF10  based on the three  SNPs (rs2280887, rs9657362 and rs4480162). After correcting the   $P$   values for multiple testing, no significant  differences were found among these three haplotypes  with all values higher than 0.05.  

# Hardy–Weinberg balance analysis  

The observed genotype frequencies of three SNPs followed Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium among the controls  (  $\dot{P}>0.05$   for all three SNPs). For rs2280887, the  $\chi^{2}$   and   $P$   values were 0.05 and 0.82 for control group, and 0.23  and 0.63 for the patient group; For rs9657362, the  $\chi^{2}$   and   $P$   values were 0.13 and 0.72 for control group, and 0.97  and 0.32 for the patient group; For rs4480162, the  $\chi^{2}$  and   $P$   values were 0.72 and 0.39 for control group, and 0.74  and 0.39 for the patient group. These results indicate a  balanced genetic and Mendel population.  

# Linkage d is equilibrium test  

SHEsis statistical analysis of the haplotype frequencies and linkage d is equilibrium coefficient (  $\mathrm{{}^{\cdot}D^{\prime}}$  and   $r^{2}$  )  revealed that genotype frequencies of three SNPs followed linkage d is equilibrium but at a low level of  Linkage D is equilibrium between these SNPs (Table  5   and Figures  1  and  2 ).  

# Discussion  

In this study, we found that CG and GG genotypes of  SNP rs2280887 in  ARHGEF10  were associated with an  increased risk of ischemic stroke and confirmed that G  allele of rs2280887 is a risk factor for ischemic stroke.  Moreover, we revealed that SNP rs9657362 and SNP  rs4480162 in  ARHGEF10  were associated with ischemic  stroke under additive and dominant models. To the best  of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate  the association of SNPs rs2280887, rs9657362 and  rs4480162 in  ARHGEF10  with ischemic stroke risk in  Chinese population.  

Age and hypertension are independent risk factors  for stroke. Stroke is a late-onset disease. In order to  minimize the chance of ‘stroke-free’ and to exclude the  impact of hypertension in the control group we selected  place of residence and sex-matched, higher blood pressure, older patients without stroke as controls. Further  statistic analysis showed that the average age was higher  in the control group with high blood pressure than the  IS group. Relationship between obesity and stroke is currently controversial.[ 5 , 27 ] In this study, the body mass  index in ischemic stroke group were significantly higher  than that in control group, suggesting that obesity may  be associated with stroke.  

The survey also found that triglyceride (TG) and  low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) higher  and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were  lower in patients of hypertension with stroke group than  the controls, suggesting that TG, LDL-C and HDL-C  may also be risk factors for strokes. In addition, the ratio  of drinkers of alcohol and smokers in control group was  lower than the stroke group. A previous study showed  that alcoholism is a risk factor for stroke.[ 28 ] In this  study, the average alcohol intake was   ${\geq}8\;\mathrm{g}/$  week in the

control group, indicating that certain amount of alcohol  intake may prevent IS.  

A combination of certain risk factors and genetic factors contributes to stroke. A recent study investigated  the polymorphisms of genes involved in detoxification and DNA-repair pathways and found that OGG1  Ser326Cys and XRCC1 Arg399Gln gene polymorphisms  were associated with the development of stroke.[ 29 ]  ARHGEF10  encodes a GEF.  ARHGEF10  is mainly  involved in the regulation of Rho protein signal transduction.  In vitro  small GTPase activity assays showed  that a gene product of  ARHGEF10- activated RhoA.[ 10 ]  ARHGEF10  may promote cerebral arteriosclerosis by  increasing the RhoGTP activity of activated RhoA leading  

to arte rio sclerotic ischemic stroke.[ 30 ] A previous study  showed that  ARHGEF10  rs4376531 polymorphism is  associated at hero sclerotic stroke in Chinese population. [ 31 ] In this study, we further extended the  ARHGEF10   SNP sites to rs2280887, rs9657362, and rs4480162 and  found these three SNPs were significantly associated with  ischemic stroke. Our findings have provided additional  evidence of the importance of  ARHGEF10  in human diseases, especially ischemic stroke.  

There are some potential limitations of the present  study. First, we only examined the rural elderly patients  in Northern China, which may not present on behalf  of the populations of other regions, ethnic or social  background. Secondly, our selected SNPs are located in  introns, the functions of which are not clear. In addition, although Power and Sample Size Calculation (version 3.1.2, 2014) ( http://Biostat.mc vanderbilt edu/wiki/ Main/Power Sample Size ) revealed a power of 0.9 based  on the lowest MAF among SNPs,[ 32 ] the overall sample  size was relatively small. Studies of multi centered with  a larger sample size from different regions, ethnic or  social background are needed.  

In conclusion, our findings have provided new  insights into the roles of  ARHGEF10  SNPs rs2280887,  rs9657362, and rs4480162 in the development and progression of ischemic stroke in northern Chinese Han  population.
