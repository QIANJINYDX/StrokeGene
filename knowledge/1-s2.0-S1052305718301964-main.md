Background:  Ischemic stroke (IS) is considered to be a heterogeneous, multifactorial disease with a strong genetic background. This study aims to determine whether variants in the antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) gene are associated with IS in Han Chinese, as well as whether there is evidence of a gene-environment interactions.  Materials and Methods:  A case-controlled association study was conducted in which only patients with a the roth rom bot ic stroke (ATS) were enrolled. Multi factor dimensionality reduction model was employed to screen the best interaction combinations among gene and environmental risk factors;  Results:  A total of 405 subjects (200 cases and 205 controls) and 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANRIL gene were included in this study. The 4 SNPs (rs1537378, rs2184061, rs7044859, and rs7865618) were found to be sign i cant ly related to ATS in Chinese Han nationality. In overall people or subjects aged 45 years or older, the GG genotype and G allele of rs1537378, the AA genotype and A allele of rs2184061 and rs7865618, and the AA genotype of rs7044859 increased the risk of ATS. In males, the GG genotype and G allele of rs1537378, the AA genotype and A allele of rs7865618, and the A allele of rs2184061 conferred a susceptibility to ATS. Additionally, the AAA GAG C AAAAAA TAG haplotype exhibited an elevated risk of ATS, and a signiﬁcant interaction was found in ATS susceptibility between ANRIL gene and dys lipid emi a;  Conclusions:  The ANRIL gene was related to ATS susceptibility in a Han Chinese. Future studies should be performed with larger samples and among different ethnic populations.

# Introduction  

Stroke is the second most common cause of death and disability-adjusted life-years worldwide.   In China, it was reported that the cerebro vascular diseases were ranked as the leading cause of death in   $2013,^{3}$    and the present data showed that the age standardized prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates of stroke were 1114.8, 246.8, and 114.8 per 100,000 person-years, respectively.   It was found that the total hospitalization expenses for both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke (IS) was approximately 75.6 billion Yuan (RMB) in China in 2015,   and moreover, with the improvement of people’s living standards, the cost of treatment for stroke increased greatly, imposing a huge burden on lots of families with sufferers as well as the country.   IS accounts for about   $43.7\%–78.9\%$   of all stroke cases.   Studies indicated that genetic inﬂuences might contribute to a predisposition to IS.   For all IS, heritability was   $37.9\%$  , and it varied markedly by stroke subtype being   $40.3\%$  for large-vessel disease and   $32.6\%$   for card i oem boli c but lower for small-vessel disease   $(16.1\%)$  .   IS is caused mainly by thr ombo embo li c occlusion of the brain arteries secondary to atherosclerosis,   and therefore, it follows that there is an emerging interest in the susceptible genes for different path o physiological pathways of atherosclerosis.  

Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), identiﬁed as non– protein-coding RNAs, have long lengths with over 200 nucleotides and are involved in many biological actions including cell growth and proliferation, and so on. Antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL), belonging to the lncRNA family, is a   $3.8\,\mathrm{kb}$   lncRNA, reversing from a gene cluster named INK4BARFINK4A in direction. ANRIL knockdown was found to inhibit proliferation either in vivo or in vitro.   ANRIL was also found to have a strong association with the risk of atherosclerosis,   playing a key role in atherosclerotic diseases. A genome-wide association study showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the chromosome 9p21 locus were associated with both IS and coronary artery disease (CAD).   The  $\mathrm{9p21}$   locus contains the ANRIL gene. Thus, it is plausible that the ANRIL gene is also correlated with a the roth rom bot ic stroke (ATS).  

ATS is a main subtype of IS, and the patients aged 70 years old or younger have a stronger genetic background. We therefore performed the case-control study including patients with ATS aged 19-70 years old alone by using the tagging SNPs as genetic marker for investigating the role of the ANRIL gene in IS. Additionally, owing to the heterogeneity of IS, which path oph y sio logy is likely regulated by a combination of environmental/ lifestyle and unclear genetic risk factors, we also examined the occurrence of gene-environment interactions in ATS risk.  

# Materials and Methods  

Study Population  

The subjects were recruited from consecutive patients aged 19-70 years admitted with a ﬁrst-ever IS to the Department of Neurology in Nanchong Central Hospital Affiliated to North Sichuan Medical College between 2012 and 2013. Inclusion criteria was as follows: (1) IS was deﬁned according to the World Health Organization (WHO) deﬁnition 16   and conﬁrmed by a brain computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging scan showing a recent brain infarct corresponding to the clinical presentation within 3 weeks of the event; (2) only subjects with an ATS diagnosed in accordance with the Korean modiﬁed TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) class i cation (KmTOAST) 17   because of the KmTOAST being more sensitive than the original TOAST classiﬁ- cation for the diagnosis of ATS.  

The patients with IS secondary to other diseases and the ATS cases with liver/kidney disease, systemic infection, thr ombo ly tic therapy, pregnancy, or other serious situation were excluded. The unrelated age- and sexmatched healthy controls were randomly selected from volunteers accepting health examinations in the same hospital during the same period by the odd number of their healthy ﬁles. They were free of neurological diseases by clinical manifestations and physical examinations, and followed the same exclusion criteria as cases. All of the subjects were Han Chinese patients with no consanguinity relationships among them.  

The study was approved by the ethics committee of Nanchong Central Hospital, and all eligible subjects provided written informed consent to participate in the study.  

# Baseline Examination  

A detailed medical history was obtained from each subject through an interview and physical examination. Demographic features, clinical features, biochemical parameters, and established risk factors for IS were recorded.  

The body mass index was calculated as the weight divided by the height squared, with a body mass index of   $24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$    taken as the cutoff point for being overweight.   Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed by the criteria of WHO in 1999.   Hypertension was deﬁned as present if subjects had previously been diagnosed according to WHO/International Society of Hypertension Guidelines (systolic or diastolic blood pressure  ${\geq}140\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{Hg}$  or  ${\ge}90~\mathrm{mm}$     ${\mathrm{Hg}},$   respectively).   Cigarette smoking was deﬁned as having smoked consistently at least 1 cigarette per day for 1 year or more, and alcohol consumption was deﬁned as drinking alcohol at least 12 times during the past year.   Dys lipid emi a was diagnosed by using Chinese criteria published in 2007.  

# SNPs Selection  

Data were sourced from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Bulletin 36. SNPs were selected by using the genotype data obtained from unrelated Han Chinese in Beijing in the HapMap database with an   $\mathrm{r}^{2}$  threshold of .8 and a minor allele frequency of  $10\%$  . The SNPs located in  $5^{\prime}$  - and/or  $3^{\prime}$  -ﬂanking or untranslated regions were also selected for analysis. At last, 16 SNPs in ANRIL gene at chromosome 9p21 (rs2184061, rs7044859, rs10738607, rs1537375, rs1004638, rs2383207, rs10738609, rs10757278, rs10757274, rs2383206, rs1333049, rs1333040, rs10116277, rs10757269, rs1537378, and rs7865618) were selected for further analyses.  

# DNA Isolation and Genotyping  

Venous blood samples were collected from all subjects in EDTA-treated evacuated tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples according to standard procedures by using a TIANamp Genomic DNA kit (TIANamp Blood DNA Kit, DP318, TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China). Detailed information has been described elsewhere.  

All SNPs were genotyped by using the iMLDR platform with the technical support of Genesky Bio technologies Inc., Shanghai, China. The process used by the manufacturer is brieﬂy described in the following: multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in a total volume of  $10.0\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   containing   $1\times\mathrm{G}\mathrm{C-}\mathrm{I}$   buffer (Takara, Kawasaki, Japan),   $3.0\,\mathrm{{mM}\;\mathrm{{Mg}^{2+}}},$  , .3 mMdNTP, 1U HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany),   $1.0\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of genomic DNA   $(5{-}10\,\mathrm{ng}/\upmu\mathrm{l})$  , and   $1.0\,\upmu\mathrm{\,PCR}$   primer ( Table 1 ). The program used was an initial de natura tion step of  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for 2 minutes followed by the ﬁrst 11 cycles of denaturation at   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20 seconds, annealing at   $65^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 40 seconds (the annealing temperature was decreased by   $.5^{\circ}C$  in each consecutive cycle), and elongation at  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 90 seconds, and followed by the second 24 cycles of denaturation at   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20 seconds, annealing at   $59^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 seconds, and elongation at  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 90 seconds. A ﬁnal extension step was done at  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 2 minutes and was maintained at  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . To avoid the effect of primers and unincorporated de oxy nucleotides from the preliminary PCR on the subsequent primer extension reaction, the multi- plex PCR products were subsequently puriﬁed in  $10.0\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  reaction volumes. Brieﬂy,   $10.0\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of PCR products was incubated with 5U SAP (Promega, Madison, WI) and 2U Exon ucl ease I (Epicentre, Madison, WI) at   $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 60 minutes, and then extinction at   $75^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 15 minutes. The following ligase chain reaction was conducted in a total volume of   $10.05\,\upmumathrm{l},$   containing  $2.0\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of puriﬁed PCR products,   $.4\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of  $5^{\prime}$   premier mixture   $(1\;\upmu\mathrm{M})$   ( Table 1 ),   $.4\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of  $3^{\prime}$   premier mixture   $(2\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$   ( Table 1 ),  $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   $10\times\mathrm{DNA}$   ligase buffer,   $.25\;\upmu\mathrm{L}$   thermos table DNA ligase, and   $6.0\;\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of  $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O}$  . The program was 38 cycles of de natura tion at  $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 60 seconds, annealing at   $56^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 4 minutes, and keeping at  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The ﬁnal step of iMLDR (Shanghai, China) included sequencing and analyses. Namely, a  $9.0\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   volume of Hi-Di (ABI, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,) was mixed with .  $5\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of the diluted ligation reaction products and   $.5\,\upmu1\;500$   LIZ size standard (ABI), and then the mixture was electro ph ores ed on an ABI   $3730\mathrm{XL}$   genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) after a de natura tion at  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for 5 minutes. The parameters suggested in the iMLDR (Genesky Bio technologies Inc.) protocol were used. The data were analyzed by using GeneMapper Software v4.1 (Applied Biosystems).  

# Statistical Analyses  

Continuous variables are expressed as mean  $\pm$   standard deviation values. Differences between continuous variables were evaluated by the independent samples t  test or the Mann–Whitney U test, depending on the shape of the distribution curves. Three genetic models (dominant, recessive, and allelic comparison) were assumed while performing statistical analyses. Multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment of con founders was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and  $95\%$   conﬁdence interval (CI) for the risk genotypes, and variables with  $P<.10$  on univariate analysis were included in a regression model. Subgroup analyses were also performed by stratifying the subjects according to sex and age (  ${<}45$   or  ${\geq}45$   years of age).  

Haplotype construction was performed by using the genetic statistical software SHEsis.   Multi factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) open-source software package ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/mdr/ ) was used to analyze the interactions.   Some parameters including cross-validation consistency, the testing balanced accuracy, and the sign test were calculated. A permutation test (1000 times, providing empirical  $P$   values) for prediction accuracy can be used to measure the sign i can ce of an identiﬁed model. Logistic regression was also used to evaluate the role of the signiﬁcant interaction combinations obtained from MDR in ATS risk.  

All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), and a probability value of  $P<.05$   (2-tailed) was considered signiﬁcant, unless indicated otherwise.  

# Results  

# General Characteristics  

A total of 769 patients with IS were admitted to Nanchong Central Hospital during the study period. Two hundred seventy-one   $(35.2\%)$   were classiﬁed with ATS, of which, 67 were excluded from the study because of receiving thr ombo ly tic therapy, suffering from liver or kidney disease, being pregnant, or having other severe systematic diseases. Two hundred eight volunteers under the inclusion criterion were selected as controls. However, genotyping failed for some loci in 4 cases and 3 controls

samples. In short, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria aforementioned, 200 subjects with ATS and 205 controls were ultimately genotyped successfully, and recruited for the present study. The ATS had an average age of  $59.12\pm8.65$   and control subjects with  $58.67\pm7.86$  years. Women accounted for   $38.5\%$   of the ATS group  $\mathsf{(n=77)}$  ) and   $45.9\%$   of the controls   $(\mathsf{n}=94)$  ). One hundred sixty-three, 135, or 108 subjects took aspirin/clop i dog rel, statins, or anti hypertension agents in ATS group, respectively, whereas 12, 8, or 112 in controls. There were signiﬁcant differences in frequencies of overweight, dys lipid emi a, smoking, and drinking between groups in univariate analysis on risk factors. However, overweight and dys lipid emi a differences remained statistically signiﬁcant after adjusting the covariants. We also found that the statins and aspirin/clop i dog rel use were more common in ATS group   $\left(P=.000\right)$  . The demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects were presented in Table 2 .  

# The SNPs Analyses  

The distribution of all 16 SNPs genotypes among the controls was consistent with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium model   $\left(P>.05\right)$  . The frequencies of genotypes and alleles in these SNPs among subjects were shown in  Table 3 .  

In overall people, the analyses showed that the 4 SNPs (rs1537378, rs2184061, rs7044859, and rs7865618) had a signiﬁcant association with ATS. Namely, the GG genotype and G allele of rs1537378 (GG versus   $(\mathrm{AA}+\mathrm{CA})$  :

  $\mathrm{OR}=2.256,$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.286-3.960,    $P=.005$  ; G versus A:

  $\mathrm{OR}=1.745$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.141-2.667,    $P=.009)$  ), the AA genotype and A allele of rs2184061 and rs7865618 (for rs2184061: AA versus   $(\mathrm{AC}+\mathrm{CC})$  :   $\mathrm{OR}=1.635,$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.039-2.573,  $P=.034;$  ; A versus C:  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.39.$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.036-1.862,    $P=.028$  . For rs7865618: AA versus  $(\mathrm{GA}+\mathrm{GG})$  :  $\mathrm{OR}=2.472$  ,  $95\%$   CI:

 1.348-4.536,  $P=.003\$  ; A versus G:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.91$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.196-

 3.049,  $P=.006,$  ), and the AA genotype of rs7044859 increased the risk of ATS   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.657$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.053-2.607,  $P=.029)$  ). In subjects aged 45 years or older, the results were similar to the overall group. That is to say, the GG genotype and G allele of rs1537378, the AA genotype and A allele of rs2184061 and rs7865618, and the AA genotype of rs7044859 were associated with the risk of ATS (See  Table 3  for details). In males, the GG genotype and G allele of rs1537378 (for GG genotype:   $\mathrm{OR}=3.124$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.546- 6.315,  $P=.002;$  ; for G allele:  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,2.198$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.271-3.802,

However, no any association of all SNPs with ATS was found in females ( Table 3 ).  

# Haplotypes Analyses  

All 16 loci (the order of SNPs listed being rs7044859, rs7865618, rs2184061, rs1537378, rs10757269, rs10116277, rs1333040, rs10738607, rs10757274, rs10738609, rs2383206, rs1004638, rs2383207, rs1537375, rs10757278, and rs1333049) were analyzed for constructing haplotypes (the frequency of haplotypes constructed will reach .03 or more at least, and all those frequency  $<\!.03$   will be ignored in analysis) in overall or sub population groups ( Table 4 ). It was found that in the overall group, males, or those aged  ${\geq}45$   years, the frequency of subjects carrying the AAA GAG C AAAAAA TAG haplotype was sign i cant ly higher in the ATS group than in the control group   $(9.8\%$  versus   $3.2\%,$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}=3.175$  ,    $P<.01$  ;   $11.4\%$   versus   $3.2\%$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}=3.730,$  ,  $P<.01$  ;   $9.9\%$   versus  $3.2\%,$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}=3.226,$  ,  $P<.01$  ; respectively), which was associated with an increased risk of ATS, and frequency of the TG CAA GC AAAAAA TAG haplotype was sign i cant ly lower in the ATS group and showed a protection against ATS. In addition, the AAA GG TT GAA AT GC AG haplotype also demonstrated a protective effect on ATS in overall group, females, or those aged  ${\geq}45$   years.  

# The Interactions of Gene-Environment  

MDR model was used to screen the best interaction combinations for gene-environmental factors interaction. The traditional risk factors with a    $P$   value of .10 or less will be entered into the interaction analyses. The results revealed a signiﬁcant interaction between the ANRIL gene and dys lipid emi a (rs7044859 and rs10757269;  $P<.01$  ) in overall population, and interaction between the ANRIL gene and overweight (rs2184061 and rs1004638;  $P<.01$  ) or dys lipid emi a (rs7044859 and rs10757269;  $P<.01$  ) in  ${\geq}45$  years group, as well as interaction between ANRIL gene and dys lipid emi a (rs7044859;  $P<.01$  ) in females. Nevertheless, no signiﬁcant interactions were found in males. Table 5  showed the best interaction model between the ANRIL gene and environmental risk factors with a permutation test (1000 times).  

The logistic regression was used to evaluate the role of high-risk interactions in ATS. After covariates adjustment, in overall population or subjects aged 45 or older, the carriers with A allele of rs7044859 and G allele of rs10757269 plus dys lipid emi a had an increased risk of ATS than subjects carrying TT genotype of rs7044859 plus AA of rs10757269 with no dys lipid emi a (overall people:

  $\mathrm{OR}=11.399$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 5.623-23.107,  $P=.000;\ge45$   years: OR

  $\l=\,16.086,$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 7.058-36.664,  $P\;=\;.000,$  ; respectively); however, there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the high-risk block and low-risk one in interaction model (rs2184061-rs1004638—overweight) (OR,  $95\%$   CI: 1.806, 972-3.354,    $P=.061.$  ) in 45 or older group. For females, the subjects with dys lipid emi a plus the AA and AT genotypes combined of rs7044859 had a higher risk of ATS than one carrying TT genotype without dys lipid emi a (OR: 85.346,  $95\%$   CI: 11.228-648.747,  $P=.000$  ).  

# Discussion  

# The Traditional Risk Factors for ATS  

The present case-control study showed that overweight and dys lipid emi a were sign i cant ly associated with ATS. Namely, the dys lipid emi a increased the risk of ATS; however, overweight was negatively related to ATS. This is similar to ﬁndings in another study in Nigeria

(dys lipid emi a was the most frequent risk factor).   Mounting evidence supported the strong association between lipid disorder and large artery at hero sclerotic stroke. The studies also revealed a signiﬁcant association between dys lipid emi a and stroke recurrence in entire IS at 5 years of follow-up (OR,  $95\%$   CI: 1.2, 1.02-1.42), and in the large artery at hero sclerotic stroke subtype (OR,   $95\%$   CI: 1.46, 1.12-1.91).   For overweight, a big meta-analysis involving 2 million individuals showed that overweight and obesity had a progressively increased risk of IS.   Another study found that the overweight or obesity had bigger risk of IS in young adulthood (for overweight: risk ratio  $=1.40$  ,  $95\%$     ${\mathrm{CI}}=1.24–1.58,$  ; for obesity: risk ratio  $=1.78,$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=1.003–3.16$  ).   The small samples in our study might be responsible for the inconclusive results compared with other studies. In addition, it is easier to understand the greater use of anti platelets and stains agents in cases because of the need to secondary prevention of stroke.  

# The Relationship of SNPs and IS  

In this study, 4 SNPs (rs1537378, rs2184061, rs7044859, and rs7865618) were found to be signiﬁ- cantly related to ATS in Chinese Han nationality, and the AAA GAG C AAAAAA TAG haplotype exhibited an elevated risk of ATS. Additionally, a signiﬁcant interaction was found in ATS susceptibility between ANRIL gene and dys lipid emi a.  

It is well known that the chromosome 9p21 risk interval regulates vascular remodeling pathways. The locus lies adjacent to a cluster of cell-cycle regulating genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors 2A and 2B (CDKN2A, CDKN2B). The products of these genes impair cell-cycle progression, resulting in an anti pro life rat ive effect on arterial smooth muscle. In humans, homozygous carriers of the 9p21 risk allele have a modest, but signiﬁcant, decrease in expression of CDKN2B and up regulation of gene sets involved in cellular proliferation in white cells. It was also observed that a markedly decreased expression of CDKN2A and CDKN2B in the mutant mice, as well as a doubling of the pro life rat ive capacity of mutant aortic smooth muscle cells (a cellular phenotype relevant to atherosclerosis) in culture.  

ANRIL, a newly annotated gene encoding a large antisense noncoding RNA, with a ﬁrst exon located in the promoter of the CDKN2A gene and overlapping the 2 exons of CDKN2B. Expression of this noncoding RNA co clustered mainly with p14/ARF in both ph y sio logic and pathologic conditions. The 9p21 region may promote athero sclerosis by regulating expression of ANRIL, which in turn is associated with altered expression of genes controlling cellular proliferation pathways.   ANRIL has recently been shown to be expressed in human atheromatous vessels including both abdominal aortic aneurysm and carotid end art erect o my samples. It was further found to be expressed in isolated vascular endo the li al cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and coronary smooth muscle cells; all of which have a role in atherosclerosis. ANRIL represents a good candidate for atherosclerosis risk.  

A few studies had shown that several SNPs loci of the ANRIL gene were sign i cant ly associated with CAD. Moreover, it has recently been shown that ANRIL regulates the expression of genes involved in glucose or fatty acid metabolism and in amma tion, which would further support the modulatory effect of this lncRNA in the pathogen es is of atherosclerosis.   ANRIL expression is also associated with other cerebro vascular disease risk factors including age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. At hero sclerotic stroke shares common risk factors and path o physiological mechanisms with CAD such as myocardial infarction,   another well-known at hero sclerotic disease, and they appear to have common susceptibility loci. Thus, it is plausible that ANRIL also plays a role in at hero sclerotic stroke.  

We also found a signiﬁcant interaction between the ANRIL gene and dys lipid emi a for IS. It is well known that genetic and environmental factors play a role simultan e ou sly in IS risk, and furthermore, it is highly likely that these factors do not only act independently but also interact with each other. The ANRIL gene or the encoded proteins are sign i cant ly related to vascular risk factors such as dys lipid emi a, diabetes, and hypertension. These results make us understand easily the interactions of the gene and environmental factors in IS risk.  

# The Limitations  

There were several possible limitations to this study that need to be addressed. First, a relatively small sample size of the study may have limited the statistical power of the analysis. Second, there was a potential selection bias because the cases and controls were recruited from the hospital. Third, performing multiple analyses may have increased the likelihood of spurious results. Nevertheless, corrections for multiple testing, which were considered appropriate for hypothesis-testing studies, were not applied. Because any genetic association study that includes only a small number of polymorphisms should generally be regarded as exploratory in character, such corrections were considered overly conservative for this exploratory study.  

# Conclusions  

In summary, accumulated evidence so far indicated that the ANRIL gene was found to have a signiﬁcant association with IS risk. Larger sample sizes and improved methodologies are required to verify the present ﬁndings among different peoples in future studies. The functional studies are needed to deﬁne the mechanisms by which these loci translate into a higher risk of IS.
