Abstract:  This study aimed to detect the association of the  MADD-FOLH1  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their haplotypes with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke (IS) in a Chinese Han population. Six SNPs of rs7395662, rs326214, rs326217, rs1051006, rs3736101, and rs7120118 were genotyped in 584 CHD and 555 IS patients, and 596 healthy controls. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs7395662 SNP were different between controls and patients, and the genotypes of the rs7395662 SNP were associated with the risk of CHD and IS in different genetic models. Six main haplotypes among the rs1051006, rs326214, rs326217, rs3736101, and rs7120118 SNPs were detected in our study population, the haplotypes of G-G-T-G-C and G-A-T-G-T were associated with an increased risk of CHD and IS, respectively. The subjects with rs 7395662 GG genotype in controls had higher triglyceride (TG) and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than the subjects with AA/AG genotypes. Several SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption to inﬂuence serum TG (rs326214, rs326217, and rs7120118) and HDL-C (rs7395662) levels. The SNP of rs3736101 interacted with cigarette smoking to modify serum HDL-C levels. The SNP of rs1051006 interacted with body mass index    ${\geqslant}24\mathrm{\kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$    to modulate serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The interactions of several haplotypes and alcohol consumption on the risk of CHD and IS were also observed.

# 1. Introduction  

Coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke (IS) remain the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide [ 1 , 2 ]. The pathological basis of both diseases is atherosclerosis, a progressive in amma tory disorder and, therefore, CHD and IS may share common pathogen es is, as well as many risk factors [ 2 , 3 ]. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identiﬁed many genes and loci in the predisposition to CHD [ 4 ] or IS [ 5 ] in different populations. Furthermore, some genetic variants originally shown to inﬂuence the risk of CHD were also subsequently found to be associated with IS [ 6 , 7 ].  

The MAP-kinase activating death domain (MADD) and folate hydrolase 1 (FOLH1) gene ( MADD-FOLH1 ) is located on chromosome 11p. The MADD protein can modulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha and propagate the apoptotic signals [ 8 ]. Folate is an essential nutrient that supports nucleotide synthesis and biological methyl ation reactions. Diminished folate status results in chromosome breakage and is associated with several diseases, including cardiovascular disease [ 9 , 10 ]. Genetic variants involved in folate metabolism may modify the effects of lifestyle (smoking and drinking) on plasma homo cyst eine concentrations—a risk factor for cardiovascular disease [ 11 ]. A novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of rs7395662 in or near  MADD-FOLH1  has been found association with serum lipid levels [ 12 , 13 ] and the risk of CHD [ 14 ] in a previous GWAS and two replication studies. Exactly as patterns of linkage d is equilibrium (LD) vary between populations, genetic anomalies of ion channels or speciﬁc endo the li al regulators may underlie coronary micro vascular disease [ 15 , 16 ], the results are complicated and inconsistent across different populations [ 17 , 18 ]. In addition, there are still many variants have not been explored in the MADD-FOLH1  cluster. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to detect the association of six SNPs (rs7395662, rs326214, rs326217, rs1051006, rs3736101, and rs7120118) in or near  MADD-FOLH1 and their haplotypes with serum lipid traits and the risk of CHD and IS in a Chinese Han populations.  

# 2. Materials and Methods  

# 2.1. Study Patients  

A total of 1139 unrelated patients with CHD (  $(n=584)$  ) and IS (  $n=555,$  ) were recruited from hospitalized patients in the First Afﬁliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University. The diagnosis of CHD was based on typical ischemic discomfort plus one or more of electrocardiograph ic change (ST-segment depression or elevation of    ${\geqslant}0.5\;\mathrm{mm}$  , T-wave inversion of    ${\geqslant}3\ \mathrm{mm}$   in    ${\geqslant}3$   leads, or left bundle branch block), as well as increases in the cardiac markers, including creatinine kinase-MB and troponin T. Coronary angiography was performed in patients with CHD. The coronary angiograms were reviewed by two independent ang io graph ers who were both blinded to the results of the genotypes. For a vessel to be scored, stenosis    ${\geqslant}50\%$   had to be noted in an epicardial coronary vessel of interest or in one of its major branches. In the event of disc or dance of the number of vessels scored between the two reviewers, angiograms were scored by a third independent reviewer. The selected CHD patients were subject to signiﬁcant coronary stenosis (  $(\geqslant\!50\%)$  ) in at least either one of the three main coronary arteries or their major branches (branch diameter  ${\geqslant}2\,\mathrm{mm}$  ). Additionally, ang io graphic severity of disease was classiﬁed according to the number of coronary vessels with signiﬁcant stenosis (luminal narrowing    ${\geqslant}50\%$  ) as one-, two-, or three-vessel disease in the three major coronary arteries [ 19 , 20 ]. The diagnosis and class i cation of IS was ascertained in accordance with the TOAST (Trial of  $\mathrm{Org\,10172}$   in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria [ 21 ] after strict neurological examination, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The selected IS patients in the study included individuals who were eligible for one of the two subtypes of TOAST criteria: large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel occlusion. Individuals with a history of he mato logic or brain MRI revealing cerebral hemorrhage, card i oem boli c stroke or unspeciﬁed stroke, neoplastic or intra cranial space-occupying lesion, infection, and other types of intra cranial lesions, renal, liver, thyroid, autoimmune diseases, and type 1 diabetes were excluded. The selected IS patients who had a past history of CHD were also excluded, while the selected CHD patients who had a past history of IS were excluded from the study.  

# 2.2. Control Subjects  

A total of 596 control subjects matched by age, gender, and ethnic group were randomly selected from the healthy adults who underwent periodical medical check-up at the Physical Examination Center of the First Afﬁliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University during the same period when CHD and IS patients were recruited. The controls were free of CHD and IS by questionnaires, history-taking, and clinical examination. The examination comprised physical examination, blood sampling, electrocardiograph y, chest X-ray, and Doppler echo car dio graph y. All enrolled individuals were Han Chinese from Guangxi, the People’s Republic of China. Information on demography, socioeconomic status, medical history, and lifestyle factors was collected by trained research staff with standardized questionnaires for all participants. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Afﬁliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant before data collection. The reported investigations were in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.  

# 2.3. Biochemical Measurements  

Venous blood samples were obtained from all subjects after at least   $12\,\mathrm{h}$   of fasting. The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in samples were determined by enzymatic methods with commercially available kits, Tcho-1, TG-LH (RANDOX Laboratories Ltd., Ardmore, Diamond Road, Crumlin Co., Antrim, UK, BT29 4QY), Cholestest N HDL, and Cholestest LDL (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Serum apo lipoprotein (Apo) A1 and ApoB levels were detected by the immuno turbid i metric immuno as say (RANDOX Laboratories Ltd.). All determinations were performed with an auto analyzer (Type 7170A; Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in the Clinical Science Experiment Center of the First Afﬁliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University [ 22 – 33 ].  

# 2.4. Diagnostic Criteria  

The normal values of serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA1, and ApoB levels, and the ratio of ApoA1 to ApoB in our Clinical Science Experiment Center were 3.10–5.17, 0.56–1.70,  $).91-1.81,\,2.70-3.20\,\mathrm{mmol/L},\,1.00-1.78,\,0.63-1.14\,\,\mathrm{g/L},$   and 1.00–2.50, respectively [ 22 – 33 ]. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed according to the WHO diagnostic criteria for diabetes: (1) fasting glucose  $(\mathrm{FPC})\geqslant7.0\;\mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{L};$   (2)  $2\:\mathrm{h}$   post pr an dial glucose  $\geqslant\!11.1\;\mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{L};$   or (3) self-reported diagnosis of diabetes or use of anti-diabetic medications [ 34 , 35 ]. The individuals with TC  ${>}5.17\,\mathrm{mmol/L},$   and/or  $\mathrm{{TG}\,{>}1.70\,\mathrm{{mm}/L}}$   were deﬁned as hyper lipid emi c [ 36 – 38 ]. Hypertension was deﬁned according to the criteria outlined by the 1999 World Health Organization—International Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the management of hypertension [ 39 – 41 ]. Uncontrolled hypertension was deﬁned as a systolic blood pressure of   $140\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   or higher and a diastolic blood pressure of   $90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   or higher. The subjects with systolic blood pressure of only   $140\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   or higher but a diastolic blood pressure of  ${<}90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   were diagnosed as isolated systolic hypertension. Normal weight, overweight, and obesity were deﬁned as a body mass index (BMI)  ${<}24$  , 24–28, and  ${>}28\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  , respectively [ 42 , 43 ].  

# 2.5. SNP Selection  

The SNPs were selected on the basis of the following assumptions: (1) Selected SNPs were established by Haploview (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA, version 4.2);

 (2) SNPs information was obtained from NCBI dbSNP Build 132 (http://www.Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/);

 (3) SNPs were restricted to minor allele frequency (MAF)  ${>}1\%$  ; and (4) SNPs might be associated with the plasma lipid levels or cardiovascular disease in recent studies [ 12 – 18 ].  

# 2.6. Genotyping  

Genomic DNA was extracted from leucocytes of venous blood using the phenol-chloroform method, and then sent to the Center for Human Genetics Research, Shanghai Genesky Bio-Tech Co. Ltd. Genotyping of the SNPs were performed by the Snapshot technology platform [ 22 – 33 ]. The restriction enzymes for the SNPs were SAP (Promega) and Exon ucl ease I (Epicentre), respectively. The sense and antisense primers were: rs7120118F:  $5^{\prime}$  -TG CT CCCC TC TTC CAA ACC ACT $.3^{\prime}$  , rs7120118R:  $5^{\prime}$  -T CC TTC T CCCC A AGA CC TC ACT C-  $.3^{\prime}$  ; rs326214F:  $5^{\prime}$  -TG GC T CAT GAC AG GT GG TG CTA-  $.3^{\prime}$  , rs326214R:  $5^{\prime}$  -TAG CA GC GG GAT GAC A GG A AAC $\cdot3^{\prime}$  ; rs326217F:   $5^{\prime}$  -CCC A GG GAC G TTC C TT GT GTA A-  ${\cdot3^{\prime}}$  , rs326217R:  $5^{\prime}$  -CC TG GT TG CAA CAT C CACA GA AT-  $\cdot3^{\prime}$  ; rs7395662F:   $5^{\prime}$  -CT GT GG CT CCC A CAT CA CTGG $.3^{\prime}$  , rs7395662R:  $5^{\prime}$  -A A AT GAT TTT CCC TG CAT GC TAG TT $\cdot3^{\prime}$  ; rs3736101 and rs1051006F:  $5^{\prime}$  -CG GCC TT TAG GA ACC TG CT GAC $.3^{\prime}$  , rs3736101 and rs1051006R:   $5^{\prime}$  -TT GG CT GAA TCG GG GAG TG TAA-  $.3^{\prime}$  .  

# 2.7. Statistical Analyses  

The statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical software package SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative variables were expressed as mean  $\pm$   standard deviation (serum TG levels were presented as medians and interquartile ranges). Qualitative variables were expressed as percentages. Allele frequency was determined via direct counting, and the standard goodness-of-ﬁt test was used to test the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. A chi-square analysis was used to evaluate the difference in genotype distribution and sex ratio between the groups. The general characteristics between patient and control groups were tested by the Student’s unpaired  $t.$  -test. The association of genotypes and serum lipid parameters was tested by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Any variants associated with the serum lipid parameter at a value of  $p<0.008$   (corresponding to  $p<0.05$  after adjusting for six independent tests by the Bonferroni correction) were considered statistically signiﬁcant. Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the correlation between the risk of CHD and IS and genotypes. Age, gender, BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption were adjusted for the statistical analysis. Odds ratio (OR) and  $95\%$   conﬁdence interval (  $95\%$   CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. The interactions of six SNPs with alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking,  $\mathrm{BM}\geqslant24\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  , age, and sex on serum lipid levels and the risk of CHD and IS were detected by using a factorial regression analysis after controlling for potential con founders, a  $P_{I}\leqslant0.0017$   was considered statistically signiﬁcant after Bonferroni correction. The pattern of pair-wise LD between the selected SNPs was measured by  $D^{\prime}$   and  $r^{2}$    using the SHEsis software [ 44 ]. Haplotype frequency was determined by means of the algorithms implemented in the PHASE program.

# 3.1. General Characteristics of the Subjects  

The general characteristics of the patients and healthy controls are summarized in Table  1 . The values of BMI, pulse pressure, and TG were higher but diastolic blood pressure, TC, HDL-C, ApoA1, the percentages of subjects who consumed alcohol, and the ratio of ApoA1 to ApoB were lower in CHD patients than in controls   $(p<0.001$   for all). The values of BMI, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and TG were higher but TC, HDL-C, ApoA1, the percentages of subjects who consumed alcohol, and the ratio of ApoA1 to ApoB were lower in IS patients than in controls   $(p<0.001$   for all).

3.2. Genotypic and Allelic Frequencies in Controls and Patients  

The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the 6  MADD-FOLH1  SNPs are presented in Table  2 . The genotype distribution of the 5 SNPs (not including rs1051006 in IS patients,    $p=0.026)$   was concordant with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in patients and controls   $(p\ >\ 0.05$   for all). The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs7395662, but not the other ﬁve SNPs, were different between controls and patients (CHD and IS,  $p<0.01$   for all), the rs7395662G allele and rs 7395662 GG genotype frequencies were lower in CHD (G,  $36.6\%$  ; GG,  $12.7\%$  ) or IS (G,  $36.3\%$  ; GG,   $14.4\%$  ) patients than in control subjects (G,  $42.6\%$  ;  $\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}$  ,  $18.8\%$  ;  $p<0.01$   for all).

# 3.3. Genotypes of the Six MADD-FOLH1 SNPs and the Risk of CHD and IS  

As shown in Table  3 , the genotypes of the rs7395662, but not the other ﬁve SNPs, were associated with the risk of CHD after the Bonferroni correction (a value of  $p<0.008$   was considered statistically signiﬁcant) in different genetic models: co-dominant model: GG  vs.  AA (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.78,$  ,   $95\%\:\mathrm{CI}=0.66{-}0.92,$   $p=0.0068)$  ); recessive model: GG  vs.  AA/GA   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.63$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.46–0.86$  ,    $p=0.0038)$  ; and log-additive model: G  vs.  A   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.78$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.66{-}0.92$  ,  $p=0.003\$  ).  

The genotypes of the rs7395662 SNP were also associated with the risk of IS in different genetic models: dominant model: GA/GG  vs.  AA   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.70$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.55{-}0.89$  ,  $p=0.0039)$  ; and log-additive model: G  vs.  A   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.78)$  ,   $95\%$   $_\mathrm{o}\,\mathrm{CI}=0.66{-}0.91$  ,  $p=0.0024)$  ).

# 3.4. Haplotypes and the Risk of CHD and IS  

There was strong LD among the rs1051006, rs326214, rs326217, rs3736101, and rs7120118 SNPs in controls and patients   $\left(D^{\prime}=0.8946{-}0.9983\right)$   but weak LD between the rs7395662 and the other ﬁve SNPs   $(D^{\prime}=0.1127–0.3275)$  ). Thus, haplotype analyses among the ﬁve SNPs and the associations of their haplotypes and the risk of CHD and IS were performed. Six main haplotypes are shown in Table  4 . The haplotype of G-G-T-G-C (in the order of rs1051006, rs326214, rs326217, rs3736101 and rs7120118 SNPs)  

was associated with an increased risk for CHD (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}=1.59,$  ,    $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.06{-}2.38,$  ,  $p=0.026)$  . The haplotype of G-A-T-G-T was associated with an increased risk for IS (adjusted    $\mathrm{OR}=1.95,$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.04{-}3.68,\,p=0.039)$  ).

# 3.5. Genotypes and Serum Lipid Levels  

The association of the  MADD-FOLH1  SNPs and serum lipid levels in controls is presented in Table  5 . Serum TG and HDL-C levels were different among the three genotypes of the rs7395662 but not the other ﬁve SNPs   $(p=0.005\$   and 0.001; respectively), the subjects with rs 7395662 GG genotype had higher TG and lower HDL-C levels than the subjects with rs 7395662 A A and rs 7395662 AG genotypes. There was no difference in serum TC, LDL-C, ApoA1, ApoB levels, and the ApoA1/ApoB ratio among the three genotypes of the SNP.

The value of triglyceride was presented as median (interquartile range), and the difference among the genotypes was determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test. A  $p<0.008$   was considered statistically signiﬁcant after Bonferroni correction.  

3.6. Interactions of the MADD-FOLH1 SNPs and Drinking, Smoking, BMI, Age, and Sex on Serum Lipid Levels and the Risk of CHD and IS  

The interactions of the  MADD-FOLH1  SNPs and drinking, smoking, BMI, age, and sex on serum lipid levels and the risk of CHD and IS are shown in Table  6 . Several SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption to inﬂuence serum TG (rs326214, Figure  1 A; rs326217, Figure  1 B; and rs7120118, Figure  1 C) and HDL-C (rs7395662, Figure  1 D) levels. The SNP of rs3736101 interacted with cigarette smoking to modify serum HDL-C (Figure  1 E) levels. The SNP of rs1051006 interacted with  $\mathrm{BM}\geqslant24\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$    to modulate serum LDL-C (Figure  1 F) levels.

# 3.7. Interactions of the Genotypes and Drinking, Smoking, and BMI on the Risk of CHD and IS  

The rs 3736101 GA/AA genotypes interacted with alcohol consumption to decrease the risk of CHD (  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.33$  ,  $95\%$   $\%\:\mathrm{CI}=0.12–0.89$  ,  $p=0.0021\$  ). No interactions of the genotypes and smoking and BMI on the risk of CHD and IS was detected in our study population.  

# 3.8. Interactions of the Haplotypes and Drinking on the Risk of CHD  

The interactions of several haplotypes and alcohol consumption on the risk of CHD were noted in this study. As compared with the A-G-T-G-C haplotype in non-drinkers, the haplotypes of G-G-T-A-C   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.69)$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=1.02–2.8$  81) and G-A-T-G-T (  $(\mathrm{OR}=3.61\$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=1.29–10.15$  ) in non-drinkers were associated with an increased risk for CHD, whereas the haplotypes of A-G-T-G-C  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.34)$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.22–0.5$  1 ), G-A-C-G-T   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.39$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.25–0.59)$  ), G-G-T-A-C   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.11$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.04{-}0.30)$  ) and G-A-C-G-C   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.17$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.07–0.40)$   in drinkers were associated with a decreased risk for CHD.  

For the drinkers, as compared with the A-G-T-G-C haplotype, the haplotype of G-G-T-G-C  $(\mathrm{OR}=2.38)$  ,  $5\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.25{-}4.56$  ) was associated with an increased risk for CHD, whereas the haplotype of G-G-T-A-C (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.32$  ,  $95\%$   $\%\:\mathrm{CI}=0.12–0.87$  ) was associated with a decreased risk for CHD.  

As compared with the same haplotype in non-drinkers, the haplotypes of A-G-T-G-C (  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.34,$   $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.22–0.51)$  ), G-A-C-G-T   $(\mathrm{OR}\,\mathrm{=}\,0.36,95\%\,\mathrm{CI}\,\mathrm{=}\,0.24\mathrm{-}0.54)$  ), G-G-T-A-C (  $\mathrm{{OR}}\,{=}\,0.06,$  ,  $95\%$   $\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.02–0$  .19 ), G-A-C-G-C (  $_{.}=0.18,\,95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=0.06{-}0.53)$  , and G-A-T-G-T (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.07$   $,95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.01{-}0.34)$   in drinkers were associated with a decreased risk for CHD.  

3.9. Interactions of the Haplotypes and Drinking on the Risk of IS  

The interactions of several haplotypes and alcohol consumption on the risk of IS were also noted in this study. As compared with the A-G-T-G-C haplotype in non-drinkers, the haplotype of G-A-T-G-T (  $(\mathrm{OR}=4.05$  ,  $95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=1.46{-}11.27)$   in non-drinkers was associated with an increased risk for IS, whereas the haplotypes of A-G-T-G-C (  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.33$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.22–0.50$  0), G-A-C-G-T   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.39)$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.26{\leftarrow}0.58)$  , G-G-T-A-C (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.41$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.22{-}0.79)$  ), G-A-C-G-C (  $\mathrm{OR}=0.25,$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.12{-}0.52)$  , and G-A-T-G-T (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.28,$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.10{-}0.79)$   in drinkers were associated with a decreased risk for IS. For the drinkers, as compared with the A-G-T-G-C haplotype, no signiﬁcant association was detected between the haplotypes and IS.  

As compared with the same haplotype in non-drinkers, the haplotypes of A-G-T-G-C (  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.33,$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.22{-}0.50)$  ), G-A-C-G-T (  $\mathrm{{CR}}=0.48,$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.32–0.72)$  , G-G-T-A-C (  $\mathrm{OR}=0.30,$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.13–0.67)$  , G-A-C-G-C (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.37$  ,  $95\%$   $/\!_{0}\,\mathrm{CI}=0.14{-}0.98\$  ), and G-A-T-G-T (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.07$  ,    $95\%$   $_\mathrm{o}\,\mathrm{CI}=0.02–0.29$  ) in drinkers were associated with a decreased risk for IS.  

# 4. Discussion  

In the present study, we showed that the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs7395662 SNP were different between controls and CHD or IS patients, and that the rs7395662 genotypes or alleles were associated with the risk of CHD and IS in different genetic models. The SNPs of rs1051006, rs326214, rs326217, rs3736101, and rs7120118 were strong LD in controls and patients. Six main haplotypes of the ﬁve SNPs were detected. The haplotype of G-G-T-G-C was associated with an increased risk for CHD, whereas the haplotype of G-A-T-G-T was associated with an increased risk for IS. The subjects with rs 7395662 GG genotype in controls had higher TG and lower HDL-C levels than the subjects with rs 7395662 A A and rs 7395662 AG genotypes. Several SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption to inﬂuence serum TG (rs326214, rs326217, and rs7120118) and HDL-C (rs7395662) levels. Two SNPs interacted with cigarette smoking to modify serum TG (rs7395662) and HDL-C (rs3736101) levels. The SNP of rs1051006 interacted with   $\mathrm{BM}\geqslant24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathfrak{m}^{2}$    to modulate serum LDL-C levels. The rs 3736101 GA/AA genotypes interacted with alcohol consumption to decrease the risk of CHD. The interactions of several haplotypes and alcohol consumption on the risk of CHD and IS were also observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report to evaluate the interaction between the six  MADD-FOLH1  SNPs and their haplotypes and several environmental factors on serum lipid levels and the risk of CHD and IS.  

We showed that the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs7395662, but not the other ﬁve SNPs were different between controls and CHD or IS patients, the patients with CHD   $(36.6\%,\,p=0.003)$   or IS  $(36.3\%$  ,  $p=0.002,$  ) had lower frequencies of rs7395662G allele than the controls   $(42.6\%)$  . The genotypes of the rs7395662 SNP were also associated with the risk of CHD and IS after the Bonferroni correction in different genetic models. In a previous GWAS, the rs7395662G allele frequency was   $61\%$   in a total of 17,797–22,562 persons, aged 18-104 years and from geographic regions spanning from the Nordic countries to Southern Europe [ 12 ]. In two recent studies, we and other researchers showed that the allelic frequency of rs7395662G was  $44.9\%$   in the healthy Mulao population [ 13 ],  $43.7\%$   in Han Chinese [ 13 ],  $47.3\%$   in CHD cases [ 14 ], and  $51.9\%$   in non-CHD controls [ 14 ]. The data in the International HapMap Project’s database have suggested that the frequency of rs7395662G allele was  $62.7\%$   in European,   $58.9\%$   in Han Chinese in Beijing,  $48.9\%$   in Japanese, and   $44.2\%$   in Sub-Saharan African [ 13 ]. As compared with the other populations, we found that the frequency of rs7395662G allele in our study populations was lower than that in Han Chinese from Beijing, which may be caused by different sample sizes and Han Chinese from Beijing and Guangxi are different parts of Han. These results suggest that the prevalence of the rs7395662G allele variation may have racial/ethnic- and sex-speciﬁcity. The prevalence of the rs7395662G allele is higher in European than in Chinese. These ﬁndings may also partly explain why the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is different between European and Chinese.  

The association of the rs1051006, rs326214, rs326217, rs3736101, and rs7120118 SNPs and the risk of CHD and IS has not been reported previously. In the present study, we showed that there were no associations of the ﬁve SNPs and the risk of CHD and IS. However, there was high LD among the rs1051006, rs326214, rs326217, rs3736101, and rs7120118 SNPs in controls and patients. Haplotype analyses of the ﬁve SNPs showed that the haplotype of G-G-T-G-C was associated with an increased risk for CHD, whereas the haplotype of G-A-T-G-T was associated with an increased risk for IS. However, these ﬁndings still need to be conﬁrmed in the other populations with larger sample sizes.  

The results of the present study showed that serum TG and HDL-C levels were different among the three genotypes of the rs7395662, but not the other ﬁve SNPs, the subjects with rs 7395662 GG genotype had higher TG and lower HDL-C levels than the subjects with rs 7395662 A A and rs 7395662 AG genotypes. There was no difference in serum TC, LDL-C, ApoA1, ApoB levels, and the ApoA1/ApoB ratio among the three genotypes of the SNP. The association between the rs7395662 SNP and serum or plasma lipid levels has been investigated in several previous studies [ 12 – 14 ]. In a previous GWAS, Aulchenko  et al.  [ 12 ] showed signiﬁcant association between the rs7395662 SNP and HDL-C levels in 16 population-based cohorts   $(p=6\,\times\,10^{-11})$  ). The coded allele (the allele for which effect was estimated) was the rs7395662G allele. In a previous comparative study of two ethnic groups, we found that there may be a sex-speciﬁc association of the rs7395662 SNP and serum lipid concentrations in the Mulao and Han populations [ 13 ]. A recent study also showed that the rs7395662A allele was sign i cant ly associated with decreased HDL-C levels   $'\beta=-0.024,$  ,  $p=0.007)$   in 1069 healthy control subjects [ 14 ]. However, the association of the rs1051006, rs326214, rs326217, rs3736101, and rs7120118 SNPs and serum or plasma lipid phenotypes is not well-known. In a previous study, Akiyama  et al.  [ 8 ] investigated functional genes at homologous loci identiﬁed using human lipid GWASs that responded to a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet intervention in an animal model. They showed that the gene of MADD  rs7120118 SNP was potential target of lipid association (HDL-C).  MADD  encodes the MADD protein, which interacts with tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor 1 to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase and propagate apoptotic signals [ 8 ]. In addition, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5, which is also reported to interact with MADD [ 45 ], has been demonstrated to exhibit a signiﬁcant increase in its gene expression induced by high-fat, high-cholesterol diet intervention, supporting the potential involvement of both G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 and MADD in lipid metabolism [ 8 ].  

The interactions of the  MADD-FOLH1  SNPs and their haplotypes and some environmental factors on serum lipid levels and the risk of CHD and IS are not known. In the present study, we ﬁrstly showed that several  MADD-FOLH1  SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption to inﬂuence serum TG (rs326214, rs326217, and rs7120118) and HDL-C (rs7395662) levels. The SNP of rs3736101 interacted with cigarette smoking to modify serum HDL-C levels. The SNP of rs1051006 interacted with    $\mathrm{BM}\geqslant24\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$    to modulate serum LDL-C levels. The haplotypes of G-G-T-A-C and G-A-T-G-T in non-drinkers were associated with an increased risk for CHD, whereas the haplotypes of A-G-T-G-C, G-A-C-G-T, G-G-T-A-C, and G-A-C-G-C in drinkers were associated with a decreased risk for CHD. The haplotype of G-A-T-G-T in non-drinkers was associated with an increased risk for IS, whereas the haplotypes of A-G-T-G-C, G-A-C-G-T, G-G-T-A-C, G-A-C-G-C, and G-A-T-G-T in drinkers were associated with a decreased risk for IS. It is well known that heavy alcohol intake and cigarette smoking have a disadvantageous effect on lipid proﬁles. In the current study, however, we showed that the rs3736101 AG/GG genotypes interacted with cigarette smoking to increase serum HDL-C levels. The reason for this contradictory ﬁnding is not clear. In our study populations, most smokers also have drinking habits. Thus, these interactions still need to be determined.  

There were several potential limitations in this study. Firstly, the sample size was relatively small compared to many GWASs and replication studies. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to conﬁrm our results. Secondly, there were signiﬁcant differences in the general characteristics between the control and patient groups. Although age, gender, BMI, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption have been adjusted for the statistical analysis, we could not completely eliminate the potential effects of these factors on serum lipid levels and the risk of CHD and IS. Thirdly, the association of the six SNPs and serum lipid levels in the CHD and IS groups was not analyzed because of the interference of lipid-lowering drugs. Finally, it is well known that both CHD and IS are the complex multi factorial disorders that are believed to result from an interaction between the genetic background of an individual and various environmental factors. Although we have detected the association between six  MADD-FOLH1  SNPs and their haplotypes and the risk of CHD and IS, there are still many unmeasured environmental and genetic factors and their interactions.  

# 5. Conclusions  

The results of the present study showed that the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs7395662 SNP were different between controls and patients; the rs7395662 genotypes were associated with the risk of CHD and IS in different genetic models. Six main haplotypes among the rs1051006, rs326214, rs326217, rs3736101, and rs7120118 SNPs were detected. The haplotype of G-G-T-G-C was associated with an increased risk for CHD, whereas the haplotype of G-A-T-G-T was associated with an increased risk for IS. The subjects with rs 7395662 GG genotype in controls had higher TG and lower HDL-C levels than the subjects with rs 7395662 A A and rs 7395662 AG genotypes. Several SNPs and their haplotypes interacted with alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and  $\mathrm{BM}\geqslant24\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$    to modify serum TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels, and the risk of CHD and IS.
