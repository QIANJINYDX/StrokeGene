Abstract Cerebro vascular and cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. They are complex disorders resulting from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, and may share several susceptibility genes. Several recent studies have implicated variants of the Kalirin ( KALRN ) gene with susceptibility to cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes, but no studies have yet been performed in stroke patients.  KALRN  is involved, among others, in the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase, in the regulation of ischemic signal transduction, and in neuronal morphogenesis, plasticity, and stability. The goal of the present study was to determine whether SNPs in the  KALRN  region on 3q13, which includes the Ropporin gene ( ROPN1 ), predispose to ischemic stroke (IS) in a cohort of Portuguese patients and controls. We genotyped 34 tagging SNPs in the  KALRN  and ROPN1  chromosomal region on 565 IS patients and 517 unrelated controls, and performed genotype imputation for 405 markers on chromosome 3. We tested the singlemarker association of these SNPs with IS. One SNP (rs4499545) in the  ROPN1–KALRN  intergenic region and two SNPs in  KALRN  (rs17286604 and rs11712619) showed signi W cant   $(P<0.05)$   allelic and genotypic (unadjusted and adjusted for hypertension, diabetes, and ever smoking) association with IS risk. Thirty-two imputed SNPs also showed an association at  $P<0.05$  , and actual genotyping of  

three of these polymorphisms (rs7620580, rs6438833, and rs11712039) validated their association. Furthermore, rs11712039 was associated with IS   $(0.001<P<0.01)$  ) in a recent well-powered genomewide association study (Ikram et al.  2009 ). These studies suggest that variants in the KALRN  gene region constitute risk factors for stroke and that  KALRN  may represent a common risk factor for vascular diseases.  

# Introduction  

Cerebro vascular diseases, such as stroke, and card i ovas cular diseases, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), are among the top three leading causes of death and disability worldwide (Murray and Lopez  1997 ). They are complex disorders resulting from the interplay of genetics and environment, and they share many risk factors, including age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity. These a the roth rom bot ic diseases most likely also share common pathogenic mechanisms such as in X ammation and appear to have common susceptibility loci. For instance, a locus on 9p21 has been  W rmly associated with vascular path o logie s such as heart disease, stroke, aneurysms, and atherosclerosis (Matarin et al.  2008 ; Larson et al.  2007 ; McPherson et al.  2007 ; Helga do ttir et al.  2007 ,  2008 ; Kar- vanen et al.  2009 ; O’Donnell et al.  2007 ; Ye et al.  2008 ).  

The GENECARD study for early-onset CAD (Hauser et al.  2004 ), the Diabetes Heart Study (DHS) for cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome (MS) (Bowden et al.  2006 ), and a meta-analysis of four linkage studies for coronary heart disease (Chiodini and Lewis  2003 ) identi W ed linkage peaks on chromosome 3q. Ordered subset analysis signi W cantly increased the evidence for linkage at 3q13  $(\mathrm{LOD}=5.10$ ,  $P=0.008)$ ) inGENECARD families with lower-risk lipid pro W les and fewer risk factors (Shah et al.  2006 ), and subsequent peakwide association mapping led to the identi W cation of twelve SNPs in the Ropporin ( ROPN1 , OMIM 611757) and KALRN  (OMIM 604605) genes associated with early-onset CAD (Wang et al.  2007 ). Validation in additional datasets revealed that SNP rs9289231 in the  W rst intron of a  KALRN alternative transcript was associated with early-onset CAD in all white data sets examined, and the risk allele of this SNP was associated with atherosclerosis burden in human aortas (Wang et al.  2007 ). Additionally, follow-up of the DHS 3q linkage peak revealed that the  KALRN  polymorphism rs4234218 is associated with T2D, MS, and combined phenotype   $\mathrm{(T2D+MS+CVD+}$  coronary calci W ed plaque) (Rudock et al.  2008 ).  

Furthermore, a recent and well-powered genomewide association study (GWAS) conducted on four European and American cohorts including 1,164 ischemic stroke patients and 18,058 controls (Ikram et al.  2009 ) showed that several polymorphisms in Kalirin are associated with IS   $(0.001<P<0.01)$  ), even though below the genomewide signi W cance level.  

Kalirin is an extremely large gene with 60 exons spanning over  $620\,\mathrm{k\mathbf{b}}$  , characterized by multiple promoters producing developmentally regulated isoforms predominantly expressed in the brain (McPherson et al.  2004 ).  KALRN encodes for a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rho proteins, and is therefore a multifunctional protein involved, among others, in neuronal morphogenesis and secretory granule maturation (Ferraro et al. 2007 ; Rabiner et al.  2005 ). Additionally, Kalirin may have a neuro protective role by inhibiting inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) activity (Ratovitski et al.  1999 ), and participates in the regulation of ischemic signal transduction (Beresewicz et al.  2008 ).  

The goal of the present study was to con W rm if SNPs in the  ROPN1–KALRN  region predispose to ischemic stroke (IS).  

# Patients and methods  

Study subjects  

Five-hundred sixtyW ve unrelated patients with a clinical diagnosis of IS, who were under the age of 65 at stroke onset, were recruited through Neurology and Internal Medicine Departments throughout Portugal. Stroke was de W ned by the presence of a new focal neurological de W cit, with an acute onset and with symptoms and signs persisting for more than  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The stroke was con W rmed in all patients by a computed tomography scan in   $97\%$   of cases and/or magnetic resonance imaging in   $25\%$   of patients. All patients were seen, and all neuro radiology tests were reviewed by study neurologists. Trauma, tumors, infection, and other causes of neurological de W cit were excluded.  

Data collection forms were developed for this study that included extensive clinical information such as stroke charact eris tics, general clinical observation, neurological symptoms and signs, complications and interventions during hospitalization, and situation at discharge. Data were also collected on relevant lifestyle aspects and previous clinical risk factors.  

Five-hundred seventeen unrelated healthy individuals were included in this study as a control sample population. Since stroke is a late-onset disease, the control group was selected from a group of healthy volunteers with a higher mean age than the case group, thus minimizing the chances for mis-classi W cation as “stroke-free”. Control individuals were veri W ed to be free of stroke by direct interview before recruitment, but no brain imaging studies were performed. The interview also included questions on established clinical and lifestyle risk factors for stroke. All participants were adults of Portuguese Caucasian origin.  

The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of participating institutions, and all participants provided informed consent.  

SNP selection and genotyping  

All SNPs originally found associated with CAD in the CATHGEN initial dataset (Wang et al.  2007 ) were genotyped  W rst and then additional haplotype tagging SNPs were included in the study. Genotypes of 30 European (CEU) family trios were downloaded from the HapMap Release 21/phaseII Jul06, on NCBI B35 assembly, and hap- lotype tagging SNPs in the  ROPN1–KALRN  region were identi W ed in Haploview 4.0 (Barrett et al.  2005 ) with the following options: pairwise mode,   $r^{2}\,{>}\,0.8$  , and minor allele frequency (MAF)  ${>}0.1$  . A total of 34 SNPs were genotyped in a 384-well format, 31 of which using Sequenom’s (San Diego, USA) iPlex assay (primer extension of multiplex products with detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-ofX ight mass spectrometry) following manufacturer’s protocol and detected in a Sequenom MassArray K2 platform. The primer sequences are available upon request and were designed using Sequenom’s MassARRAY ®  Assay Design 3.0. Extensive quality control was performed using eight HapMap controls of diverse ethnic a Y liation, sample duplication within and across plates, non-Mendelian inheritance check in three large pedigrees, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the control group   $(P>0.05)$  , and a minimum of  $90\%$   call rate. Genotype determinations were performed blinded to a V ection status. The SNPs which failed at least one quality control (rs12634530, rs12637456, and rs13075202) or that could not be genotyped (rs1444754) using the iPlex assay were genotyped using the TaqMan allelic discrimination assays (assays-on-demand C__11236577_10, C__11236574_10, C___1720000_10, and C___9532531_10, respectively) from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, USA). Even though SNP rs13075202 was out of HWE in the control dataset  $(P<0.05)$  , it was considered for further analysis as it was genotyped consistently in two assays (iPlex and assay-ondemand) and passed all other quality checks. All the genotyping was performed in the Genomics Unit of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência.  

Statistical analysis  

An unpaired Student’s   $t$   test and a  $\chi^{2}$   test were used to compare quantitative and qualitative clinical and demographic data, respectively, between cases and controls.   $\chi^{2}$   tests for HWE, allelic association of SNPs with IS risk, and linkage d is equilibrium (LD) plots were performed using Haploview 4.0 (Barrett et al.  2005 ).  

The genotypic association between IS and each SNP was examined by logistic regression analyses using the SNPassoc v.1.4-9 package (González et al.  2007 ) imple- mented in the R freeware ( http://cran.r-project.org/ ). To adjust the association analyses for relevant confounding factors, hypertension, diabetes, and ever smoking were included as covariates in multivariate logistic regression with backward elimination of risk factors. The interaction  i among these covariates in regression models was not stron  $(-0.5<i<0.5)$  . Odds ratios (ORs) and their associated 95% con W dence intervals (CIs) were un corrected for confounding variables in the   $\chi^{2}$   tests and unadjusted logistic regression, and corrected for covariates in adjusted regression models. Results were considered signi W cant below the conventional level of 0.05. Since there is LD among some of the genotyped SNPs, we did not perform corrections for multiple testing, and un corrected   $P$   values are reported.  

Imputation  

Un genotype d SNPs in chromosome 3 were imputed with PLINK v1.04 (Purcell et al.  2007 ) using HapMap data (Release 22, 154783 SNPs in chromosome 3 with MAF greater than 0.01 and genotyping rate greater than 0.95 in the 60 CEU founders). For every imputed SNP, PLINK provides an information content metric INFO, ranging from 0 to 1 (although it can be greater than 1 occasionally). A higher INFO value generally means a better SNP imputation. All imputed SNPs with MAF in controls smaller than 0.05 and with   $\mathrm{NFeO}<0.5$   were excluded. For SNPs that have been genotyped, PLINK calculates the concordance rate among observed and imputed genotypes.  

To con W rm the imputation results, three imputed SNPs (rs7620580, rs6438833, and rs11712039) signi W cantly associated with IS were fully genotyped in our case– control biobank, and tested for association as described previously.  

# Results  

Table  1  summarizes the principal characteristics of the dataset used in this study. The average age at the  W rst stroke is  $51.7\pm9.5$   years. Since stroke is a late-onset disease, we chose to have the control group signi W cantly older than the case group to minimize misclassi W cation biases. As expected, male:female ratio, hypertension, diabetes, ever smoking, and ever drinking were signi W cantly higher in IS patients than in controls.

We  W rst tested the association with IS of the   $12~\mathrm{{SNPs}}$  (Table  2 ), originally found associated with CAD in the CATHGEN initial dataset (SNPs 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 20, 22, 31, and 37 in Wang et al.  2007 ), which includes the rs4234218 (SNP 31 in Wang et al.  2007 ) associated with cardiovascular risk, T2D, and MS (Rudock et al.  2008 ). These polymorphisms are located in  ROPN1 ,  ROPN1– KALRN  intergenic region and in the   $5^{\prime}$   region of the KALRN  gene. In our dataset, all of these polymorphisms are also haplotype tagging SNPs, with the exception of rs7613868 and rs12637456 (SNPs 7 and 9, respectively, in Wang et al.  2007 ) which are in almost complete LD  $r^{2}=0.97$  ; Fig.  1 ).  

We found that a cluster of SNPs in low LD (pairwise  $r^{2}\le0.56)$  ) in the  ROPN1–KALRN  intergenic region (rs4499545, rs7613868/rs12637456, and rs12634530) was associated with IS in allelic and unadjusted genotypic tests (Fig.  1 ; Supplementary Table 1). The association of SNP rs4499545 remained signi W cant after adjustment for covariates (  $\textstyle P=0.028$  , OR   $[95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}]=1.31$   [1.03–1.67]). rs9289231, which has been associated with early-onset CAD and atherosclerosis burden in human aortas (Wang et al.  2007 ) and rs4234218 were not associated with IS in any test performed (Fig.  1 ).  

Given the evidence for association of genetic variants in the  ROPN1–KALRN  region with IS, although with a di V erent variant than previously reported to be associated with cardiovascular risk, we decided to further investigate this region by analyzing additional SNPs. We genotyped 22 additional haplotype tagging SNPs in the  ROPN1  region, the  ROPN1–KALRN  intergenic region, and in the   $5^{\prime}$   region of  KALRN  (Table  2 ). Since the  KALRN  gene is extremely large, we chose to concentrate our e V orts on the  KALRN region with the reported associations.  

Two newly analyzed SNPs in the  ROPN1–KALRN  intergenic region LD block (rs2280422 and rs2332719) and two SNPs in  KALRN  (rs17377867 and rs6784664) were associated   $(0.003<P<0.042)$  ) in allelic and unadjusted log-additive model tests, but these associations became marginal  $(0.05<P<0.15)$  ) when adjusted for covariates (Fig.  1 ; Supplementary Table 1). Inclusion of any combination of two of these covariates had the same overall e V ect, but it is not always the same polymorphisms that become marginally signi W cant, suggesting that this may be mostly a power issue and not a biologically relevant phenomenon. On the other hand, two new SNPs in  KALRN  (rs17286604 and rs11712619) demonstrated association in all tests performed (Fig.  1 ; Supplementary Table 1).  

Table  3  presents more detailed association results for the three genotyped SNPs demonstrating an association with IS in all tests performed (rs4499545, rs17286604, and rs11712619). Similar to the rs4234218 association with cardiovascular risk, T2D, and MS (Rudock et al. 2008 ), the most signi W cant results for these three SNPs were under the dominant genetic model (Table  3 ). These polymorphisms are in very low LD (all pairwise  $r^{2}<0.34$  and   $D^{\prime}<0.58)$  ). SNP rs4499545 remains signi W cantly associated when the other two markers are used as covariates, while the association subsides for rs11712619 when adjusted for rs17286604. These data suggest at least two independent lines of evidence for association of  KALRN with IS.  

Even though we investigated 23 haplotype tagging SNPs in the   $5^{\prime}$   end of  KALRN , a large portion of its natural genetic variation was not assessed because it is a very large gene with a high degree of genetic diversity. We therefore performed genotype imputation for SNPs in chromosome 3 using data from HapMap as well as the genotypes observed at the 34 fully genotyped polymorphisms. We obtained imputed genotypes meeting minimum quality standards (MAF in controls  $\geq0.05$   and SNP   $\mathrm{IFO\geq0.5})$  ) for 405 SNPs in and around  ROPN1  and  KALRN  (Fig.  2 ). As expected, the imputed SNPs with higher information content metric (SNP   $\mathrm{INFO}>0.8)$  ) are located in the region of genotyped SNPs. As an additional quality control, the genotyped SNPs are dropped one at a time and imputed using the other observed genotypes. A concordance rate between observed and imputed genotypes can be calculated for these markers, and   $90\%$   of the genotyped SNPs had a concordance rate  ${>}85\%$   between imputed and observed genotypes (Fig.  2 ). Thirty-two of the imputed polymorphisms have an allelic association with IS risk at a more stringent  $P$   threshold

of 0.01 (Fig.  2 ; Supplementary Table 2). Among the top W ve SNPs   $(P\leq0.001)$  ), the  W rst one (rs6790975) has a modest SNP INFO metric (0.598), and therefore its association has to be taken with caution, but the remaining four markers (rs4678111, rs7620580, rs9820396, and rs1444770) have a very high SNP INFO metric (0.93) and are in complete LD (Fig.  2 ). The LD among the top 32 imputed associated SNPs (Fig.  2 ) also suggests the existence of several independent clusters of association with IS in the   $5^{\prime}$   region of the KALRN gene, such as the rs6438833–rs1373612, rs6779809–rs11712039–rs11719349  and  rs4678111– rs7620580-rs9820396–rs1444770 clusters.  

To validate the imputation results, we additionally genotyped in our dataset three SNPs (rs6438833, rs11712039, and rs4678111) representing the above mentioned clusters of association (highlighted in light gray in Table  2 ), and tested their association with IS. The average concordance rate among observed and imputed genotypes was  $92\%$  . All

Among the SNPs tested and associated with IS in this study, SNP rs11712039 has also been associated with IS  $\left(0.001<P<0.01\right)$  ) in the Ikram et al. ( 2009 ) IS GWAS, as shown in Supplementary Table 1. rs17286604 and rs11712619, which are associated with IS in our Portuguese sample, were modestly associated in the GWAS, and SNP rs4499545 has not been tested (Supplementary Table 1).  

# Discussion  

In this study, we highlight for the  W rst time an association of the Kalirin gene with risk for ischemic stroke. Given that KALRN  has already been implicated in susceptibility to cardio vascular disorders and some of its risk factors (e.g. T2D) (Wang et al.  2007 ; Rudock et al.  2008 ; Ikram et al.  2009 ), we propose that Kalirin may constitute a novel genetic risk factor for vascular phenotypes.  

Kalirin is an extremely complex gene generating many alternative transcripts under the control of several promoters in a tissue-speci W c and developmentally regulated manner (McPherson et al.  2004 ; Johnson et al.  2000 ; Ma et al. 2001 ) encoding multi domain and multi functional proteins (McPherson et al.  2002 ). A number of recent studies have demonstrated that Kalirin-7, the most abundant isoform in adult brain (Penzes et al.  2000 ), is involved in dendritic spine development, plasticity, and stability (Penzes and Jones  2008 ). Kalirin-7 gene transcripts are under expressed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) hippo camp al specimens (Youn et al.  2007a ), and under expression of Kalirin-7 increases iNOS (inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase) activity in cultured cells and correlates with increased iNOS activity in AD hippocampus (Youn et al.  2007b ). Interestingly, Kalirin is known to associate with iNOS in vitro and in vivo and to prevent iNOS dimer iz ation, and therefore iNOS activity (Ratovitski et al.  1999 ). NO, a potent cell-signaling, e V ector, and va so dil at or molecule characterized by its strong reactivity and di V usibility, is produced in a complex and tightly controlled process by three NO synthases: iNOS, neuronal synthase (nNOS), and endo the li al synthase (eNOS). Cytokines, endotoxin, or other proin X ammatory stimuli induce iNOS expression in

Unadjusted (without covariates) and adjusted (for hypertension, diabetes, and ever smoking) association testings were performed using di V erent models (codominant, dominant, recessive, and log-additive).

virtually all tissues, while nNOS and eNOS are constitutively expressed primarily in neural tissue and endothelium, respectively, which are the principal tissues involved in stroke. Several published case–control studies describe an association of genetic variants in  eNOs  with ischemic stroke risk (Domingues-Montanari et al.  2008 ), and we have found an association of nNOS with IS (personal communication). Kalirin-7 is involved in the regulation of ischemic signal transduction (Beresewicz et al.  2008 ), and may play a neuro protective role during in X ammation of the central nervous system by inhibiting iNOS activity (Ratovitski et al.  1999 ). It would therefore be interesting to assess the role played by genetic variation in Kalirin in stroke severity and recovery, as well as epistatic e V ects between  KALRN  and NO synthases in ischemic stroke risk.  

Several independent Kalirin polymorphisms have now been associated in previous studies (Wang et al.  2007 ; Rudock et al.  2008 ; Ikram et al.  2009 ) and in the present report with vascular phenotypes, and therefore it is not clear which is(are) the exact susceptibility variant(s). Kalirin appears to be a pleiotropic protein, and it is possible that di V erent variants in the same gene cause related phenotypes. Alternatively, the causal polymorphism might not have been directly studied yet, as suggested by our imputation approach. Given that we had genotyped a relatively high number of haplotype tagging SNPs in the KALRN gene region, we were able to impute hundreds of neighboring polymorphisms with high con W dence and identi W ed many SNPs with stronger association than those directly genotyped. Genomewide imputation is currently performed routinely in whole-genome association studies to increase power, but “local” imputation may also be a powerful approach to detect novel associations when there is a dense map of observed genotypes. We validated this local imputation approach in our dataset through direct genotyping.  

Another possibility is that Kalirin demonstrates an even stronger association with a pathogenic mechanism (e.g. in X ammation) or subtype (e.g. small vessel) of vascular disease that has not yet been tested directly or corrected for in the statistical analyses. This hypothesis is supported by the signi W cant increase in the evidence for linkage at 3q13  $(\mathrm{LOD}=5.10$  ,   $P=0.008\$  ) in GENECARD families with lower-risk lipid pro W les and fewer known risk factors (Shah et al.  2006 ). We did not test the association of Kalirin with IS subtypes since a much larger sample size would be required to have a representative number of individuals in each subtype and genotype category.  

Population strati W cation was a frequent confounding factor in previous association studies. It can be corrected for when genomewide data is available, but is harder to address in candidate gene studies when no ancestry-informative markers are known. Population genetic studies with very large numbers of autosomal markers have never been conducted in self-described Portuguese Caucasians. Additionally, there are no major historical events that lead us to suspect that a signi W cant proportion of Portuguese Caucasian individuals are of mixed backgrounds. Therefore, we do not expect that an underlying population substructure in our sample accounts for the observed associations.  

The type of correction for multiple testing that must be employed is subject to controversy, but our positive association  W ndings would not survive the most conservative Bonferroni correction. However, replication in multiple independent datasets remains the gold-standard of association studies, even for modest associations. Our study highlights the importance of replicating associations that fall below the genomewide signi W cance threshold. These variants may account for part of the missing heritability.  

We believe that the Kalirin association is promising because of the multiple independent lines of evidence for

( 2009 ), GWAS published study, and the previous reports of association with car dio metabolic syndrome (Wang et al.  2007 ; Rudock et al.  2008 ). Additional replication studies in other independent datasets with stroke and vascular path o logie s are needed to further con W rm Kalirin’s role in vascular disease susceptibility. Deep sequencing may have to be used to precisely identify the causal genetic variant.
