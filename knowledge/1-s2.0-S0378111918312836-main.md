Background and aims:  A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) reported an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11196288 and risk of early-onset large artery at hero sclerotic (LAA) stroke in European population. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors such as age has also received increasing attention. We performed this study to investigate the association between the rs1  $1196288\mathsf{A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$  polymorphism and LAA stroke risk in the Chinese Han population and test whether age interacts rs11196288 to in ﬂ uence LAA stroke risk.  

Methods:  Genotyping of rs11196288 was performed in 1066 LAA stroke patients and 1167 healthy controls. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to assess the e ﬀ ect of the rs1  $1196288\mathrm{~A~}>\mathrm{~G~}$   polymorphism on susceptibility and short-term outcome of LAA stroke. Nomograms were performed to estimate probability of risk for an individual patient.  

Results:  A signi ﬁ cant decrement of LAA stroke risk was found in co-dominant (AG vs. AA,   $\mathrm{{OR}=0.76}$  ,   $95\%$   ${\sf C I}=0.64–0.91$  ,  $P=0.003\$  ; GG vs. AA,   $\mathrm{OR}=0.65$  ,   $95\%\;\mathrm{CI}=0.50–0.85$  ,  $P=0.002)$  ), dominant (AG/GG vs. AA,

  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.74$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}=0.62–0.87$  ,    $P\,<\,0.001$  ) and recessive models (GG vs. AA/AG,   $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.76$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.59–0.97$  ,  $P=0.028)$  ) of rs11196288. However, the interaction between age and genotypes of rs11196288 was not statistically signi ﬁ cant, and no signi ﬁ cant association was observed between the rs 11196288 A  $>\textbf{G}$  polymorphism and short-term outcome of LAA stroke   $(P\;>\;0.05)$  ).  

Conclusions:  In the southeastern Chinese population, the rs 11196288 A   $>\textbf{G}$   polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of LAA stroke.  

# 1. Introduction  

Ischemic stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide ( Anon, 2016a ;  Mendis et al., 2015 ), loading heavy economic burden especially in low- and middle-income countries ( Benjamin et al., 2017 ). Besides traditional risk factors, genetic factors also contribute to a substantial proportion of the risk and prognosis of ischemic stroke ( Anon, 2016b ;  Lindgren, 2014 ). It is identi ﬁ ed by Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that many loci are associated with ischemic stroke ( Malik et al., 2018 ;  International Stroke Genetics C et al., 2012 ). In most cases, the associations with ischemic stroke detected in GWAS were attributed to a speci ﬁ c subtype of ischemic stroke, such as large artery at hero sclerotic (LAA) stroke ( International Stroke Genetics C et al., 2012 ;  Traylor et al., 2014 ;  Lee et al., 2016 ), card i oem boli c stroke  

(CES) ( Greta rs do ttir et al., 2008 ;  Hanscombe et al., 2015 ), and small vessel disease (SVD) ( Chauhan et al., 2016 ), suggesting the di ﬀ erent heritability of stroke subtypes and the necessity of subtype-speci ﬁ c study ( Traylor et al., 2012 ).  

Recently, a GWAS in European population demonstrated that the rs11196288, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located on chromosome 10q25 near  HABP2  gene, was signi ﬁ cantly associated with early-onset ischemic stroke and most of its subtypes ( Cheng et al., 2016 ). The  HABP2  gene, which encodes factor VII-activating protease (FSAP), has been proved to be related to in ﬂ ammatory pathways, late complications of carotid stenosis, at hero sclerotic plaque instability and stroke ( Stephan et al., 2012 ;  Gardener et al., 2011 ;  Kanse et al., 2008 ; Trompet et al., 2011 ). Based on the role of  HABP  gene and FSAP in the development of vascular in ﬂ ammation and atherosclerosis, we hypothesized that the r  $\mathsf{s11196288A\;>\;G}$   polymorphism was associated with susceptibility of LAA stroke. However, a subsequent replicate study conducted in Chinese Han population found no association between the r  $\mathsf{s11196288A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism and risk of LAA stroke.  

The role of rs1  $1196288\mathrm{A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism in risk of LAA stroke is controversial. Hence, we conducted this study to investigate whether the rs11196288A  $>\textbf{G}$   polymorphism was associated with risk of LAA stroke in the Chinese Han population. There has also been growing interest in investigating the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. We also investigated whether age interacts rs11196288 to in ﬂ uence LAA stroke risk. In addition, the relationship between the  $\tt r s11196288A\ >\ G$   polymorphism and short-term functional outcome of LAA stroke was also explored because the association is not yet clear.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. Study subjects  

Based on Nanjing Stroke Registry Program (NSRP) ( Liu et al., 2006 ), we consecutively recruited LAA stroke patients between August 2013 and December 2016. Ischemic stroke was de ﬁ ned as sudden focal neurological de ﬁ cits lasting  $\geq24\,\mathrm{h}$  , with evidence of cerebral infarction in clinically relevant areas of the brain con ﬁ rmed by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). LAA stroke was diagnosed by experienced neurologists using the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria ( Adams Jr. et al., 1993 ). Patients were enrolled if they: 1) aged 18 years or older; 2) were of Chinese Han ethnicity; 3) had a premorbid modi ﬁ ed Rankin Scale (mRS) score    $\leq1$  ; 4) had available blood samples. Exclusion criteria included severe liver or kidney dysfunction, hematological diseases, malignancies and autoimmune disorders. The non-stroke controls were recruited from local inhabitants during the same period and the inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) aged 18 years or older; 2) Chinese Han ethnicity; 3) had regular physical examination; 4) no history of transient ischemic attacks, cerebro vascular, cardiovascular and atherosclerotic diseases; 5) no history of severe liver or kidney dysfunction, hematological diseases, malignancies and autoimmune disorders.  

To evaluate the association between the r  $\cdot s11196288\mathrm{A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism and short-term functional outcome of LAA stroke, mRS score at 90 days after stroke onset was tracked. Patients would be followed-up if they meet the following inclusion criteria: having no history of stroke, being admitted to hospital within 14 days after symptom onset.  

The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of Jinling Hospital (Nanjing, China).  

# 2.2. Data collection  

Baseline characteristics included demographic information, medical histories, laboratory tests, severity of stroke and treatments. Routine laboratory investigations were performed after overnight fasting within  $24\,\mathrm{h}$   of admission. The de ﬁ nition of hyper lipid emi a is serum triglyceride    $\geq\!150\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$  , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol    $\geq\!130\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$  , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol    $\leq40\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$   in adult males and  $\leq\!50\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$   in adult females, any use of lipid-lowering drugs, or any self-reported history of hyper lipid emi a ( Wang et al., 2015 ). Stroke severity was assessed by experienced neurologists using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at admission. Short-term functional outcome was evaluated by mRS score at 90 days after stroke onset through telephone interview or face-to-face visit. For patients who were lost to follow up, we used the mRS score at discharge instead ( Minnerup et al., 2016 ). We de ﬁ ned poor outcome (3 – 6) and good outcome (0 – 2) based on mRS scores.  

# 2.3. Genotyping  

Genotyping was conducted by SNPscan technology, supported by the Center for Human Genetics Research, Genesky Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). About  $5\%$   of the samples were randomly selected and genotyped repeatedly to con ﬁ rm the genotyping credibility, and the results were   $100\%$   consistent.  

# 2.4. Statistical analyses  

Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics Version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and R version 3.4.3 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Statistical power analysis was calculated by  $\mathbf{G}^{*}$  Power version 3.1.9.3. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the control group was assessed by Pearson's chi-square test. The distribution of continuous variables was examined for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range because all of them did not meet the normal distribution. Continuous variables and categorical variables were compared by Mann-Whitney    $U$   test and Pearson's chi-square test, respectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of the rs  $\mathbf{\therefore11196288A\ >\ G}$  polymorphism with risk and short-term functional outcome of LAA stroke. Goodness of  ﬁ t was evaluated by Akaike information criterion (AIC) for selecting the best genetic models of the rs11196288 ( Sole et al., 2006 ). In the best models, the capacity of the rs11196288 in predicting a binary outcome of interest was evaluated by Net Reclassi ﬁ cation Improvement (NRI) and Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) indexes. Nomograms were developed based on results from the multivariate logistic models to estimate probability of risk and poor outcome of LAA stroke for an individual patient ( van der Naalt et al., 2017 ). The calibration curve was used to assess the calibration of the nomogram ( Wang et al., 2013 ). The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was calculated to quantify the discriminatory ability of the nomogram. The interaction between genotypes of rs11196288 and age was assessed by adding interaction term and covariates into the multivariate logistic regression analyses. All statistical analyses were two-sided and  $\textstyle P\,<\,0.05$   was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant.

# 3.1. Baseline characteristics of the subjects  

A total of 1066 LAA stroke patients and 1167 healthy controls were recruited in the study. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics are shown in  Table 1 . Compared with the controls, patients were older  $(P\,<\,0.001)$  ), had a higher proportion of male and traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke, such as history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyper lipid emi a and smoking   $(P\,<\,0.001)$  ).  

# 3.2. The rs11196288A   $>\,G$   polymorphism and risk of LAA stroke  

As shown in  Table 2 , the distribution of the rs11196288 in the controls was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium   $(P=0.301)$  .

Bold values indicate signi ﬁ cance at    $\textstyle P\;<\;0.05$  .  

The frequencies of AA, AG and GG genotypes were   $43.8\%$  ,  $44.8\%$  , and  $11.4\%$  , among the LAA stroke patients, respectively, and  $36.5\%$  ,   $49.0\%$  , and   $14.5\%$  , among the controls, respectively. Based on our sample size, statistical power in this study is  $93.5\%$   (the type I error probability for a two-sided test was 0.05, the minor allele frequency of rs11196288 for patients was 0.34 and for controls was 0.39). According to the AIC values, co-dominant is the best  ﬁ tting model. In the co-dominant model, compared with AA genotype, AG and GG genotypes of the rs11196288 were associated with signi ﬁ cantly decreased risk of LAA stroke

  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.76$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}=0.64–0.91$  ,  $P=0.003\$  ;  $\mathrm{OR}=0.65$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}=0.50–0.85$  ,  $P=0.002,$  ; respectively;  Table 2 ). After adjustment for sex, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyper lipid emi a and smoking, the association remained signi ﬁ cant   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.76$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}=0.61\substack{-0.93}$  ,  $P=0.008$   for AG vs. AA;  $\mathtt{O R}=0.59$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.43–0.80$  ,  $P=0.001$  for GG vs. AA). Based on the multivariate logistic regression analyses, IDI and NRI showed signi ﬁ cant improvement in the accuracy of the association with risk of LAA stroke when co-dominant model of the rs11196288 was added  $(\mathrm{{IDI}}=0.005$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.002–0.008$  ,  $P\,<\,0.001$  ;  $\mathrm{NRI}=0.146$  ,  $95\%~\mathrm{CI}=0.065–0.227$  ,  $P=0.004)$  ). The regression coe ﬃ cients from the multivariate logistic model were used to construct the nomogram for estimation of LAA stroke risk for an individual patient ( Fig. 1 A). The nomogram only included predictors which are signi ﬁ cant in the multivariate logistic model. The calibration curve displayed in  Fig. 1 B showed good calibration of the nomogram. The AUC value indicated that the nomogram discriminates to a good extent  $(\mathrm{AUC}=0.795$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}=0.777{-}0.814$  ; Fig. 1 C). The  $\mathrm{rs11196288A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$  polymorphism also had a protective e ﬀ ect on LAA stroke in the dominant (AG/GG vs. AA,  $\mathrm{OR}=0.72$  ,  $95\%$   ${\sf C I}=0.59–0.87$  ,    $P\,<\,0.001)$  ) and recessive models (GG vs. AA/AG,

  $\mathrm{{OR}=0.68}$  ,   $95\%$     ${\sf C I}=0.51–0.91$  ,    $P=0.010\$  ). A dose-response relationship between the G allele and risk of LAA stroke was determined by the log-additive model  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.76$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}=0.66\substack{-0.88}$  ,  $P\,<\,0.001$  ;  Table 2 ).  

# 3.3. Age-strati ﬁ ed analyses of the association between the rs11196288A   $>$   G polymorphism and risk of LAA stroke  

Considering that age may be a potential confounding factor, the association between the rs 11196288 A   $>\textbf{G}$   polymorphism and risk of LAA stroke was analyzed in early-onset and late-onset patients separately ( Table 3 ). Early-onset stroke was de ﬁ ned as the age of stroke onset  $<60$   years. Multivariate logistic regression analyses in earlyonset LAA stroke patients found that the   $\mathrm{rs11196288A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism was associated with decreased risk of LAA stroke in dominant (  $[\mathrm{OR}=0.70$  ,   $95\%$     ${\sf C I}=0.53–0.92$  ,    $P=0.010,$  ) and recessive models   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.63$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}=0.41–0.96,$   $P=0.033.$  ). AG/GG genotype of the rs11196288 was a protective factor against risk of late-onset LAA stroke in dominant model  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.73$  ,  $95\%$   ${\sf C I}=0.55{-}0.97,$  ,  $P=0.028.$  ). However, the protective e ﬀ ect of GG genotype was not statistically signi ﬁ cant in the recessive model   $(P=0.132$  ;  Table 3 ).  

# 3.4. Interaction analysis for rs11196288 and age  

As shown in  Table 4 , in dominant model, the inverse association between AG/GG genotype of rs11196288 and LAA stroke risk in older subjects   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.74$  ,  $95\%$   $5\%~{\tt C I}=0.56{-}0.97)$  ) became a little bit stronger in younger subjects   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.37/0.53=0.70)$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.53–0.92)$  , and the positive association between age and LAA stroke risk in subjects with AA genotype of rs11196288   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.00/0.53=1.89$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.39–2.56)$  ) became a little bit stronger in subjects with AG/GG genotype of rs11196288  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.74/0.37=2.00$  ,  $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=1.55–2.56)$  ). However, the interaction between age and genotypes of rs11196288 was not statistically signi ﬁ cant, no matter which genetic model was considered.

3.5. Association between the rs 11196288 A   $>$   G polymorphism and shortterm functional outcome of LAA stroke  

Of the 1066 patients, 739 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were followed-up. Demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table S1. According to the mRS scores at 90-day follow-up, poor outcomes (mRS of 3 – 6) occurred in 215   $(29.1\%)$   patients. Patients with poor outcomes were older   $\left(P=0.015\right)$  ) and had a higher admission NIHSS score   $(P\,<\,0.001)$  ) than those with good outcomes. Other variables (sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease (CHD), atrial ﬁ brillation (AF), smoking, thr ombo lysis and acute endo vascular treatment) did not di ﬀ er between the two groups   $(P\;>\;0.05$  , Supplementary Table S1).  

Variables with a marginal signi ﬁ cant di ﬀ erence   $(P\,<\,0.1)$   were included as covariates in the multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate the association between the rs 11196288 A   $>\textbf{G}$   polymorphism and short-term functional outcome (Supplementary Table S1). After adjusted for sex, age, hyper lipid emi a, NIHSS baseline, thr ombo lysis, acute endo vascular treatment in the multivariate logistic regression analyses, no signi ﬁ cant association was observed between the  $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}11196288\mathrm{A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism and outcome of LAA stroke in all genetic models   $(P\;>\;0.05$  , Supplementary Table S2).

relevant predictors (age, NIHSS baseline, acute endo vascular treatment) were included in the nomogram to predict the probability of poor outcomes of LAA stroke for an individual patient (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The calibration curve showed good calibration (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The AUC value indicated that the model only included the most relevant predictors discriminates to a good extent   $(\mathtt{A U C}=0.868$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}=0.840–0.895$  ; Supplementary Fig. S1C).  

# 4. Discussion  

Our study showed that the r  $\mathsf{s11196288A\;>\;G}$   polymorphism was associated with decreased risk but not short-term functional outcome of LAA stroke in Chinese Han population. Age-strati ﬁ ed analyses showed that in both early-onset and late-onset patients, AG and GG genotypes of the rs11196288 may have protective e ﬀ ect on individual's susceptibility to LAA stroke. There was no signi ﬁ cant interaction between rs11196288 and age for the risk of LAA stroke in all genetic models.  

To the best of our knowledge, this is the  ﬁ rst study to investigate the association between the r  $\mathsf{s11196288A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism and shortterm outcome of LAA stroke in Chinese Han population. Moreover, the sample size of this study is relatively large, considering that we mainly focused on speci ﬁ c subtype of ischemic stroke. Previous studies have found that the risk of LAA stroke varies among subjects of di ﬀ erent ages. We also conducted an age-strati ﬁ ed analysis of the association between the rs  $11196288\mathrm{A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism and risk of LAA stroke and further explored the interaction between age and rs11196288.  

The rs11196288 is in an intergenic region on chromosome 10q25. Considering the  HABP2  gene is located close to the rs11196288, it can be the possible mechanism of the association between the rs11196288A   $>\textbf{G}$   polymorphism and risk of LAA stroke. The  HABP2 gene encodes FSAP, which is an extracellular serine protease involved in the pathogen es is of cell adhesion, vascular in ﬂ ammation and atherosclerosis ( Stephan et al., 2012 ;  Gardener et al., 2011 ;  Roedel et al., 2013 ). FSAP has also been proved to be associated with atherosclerotic plaque instability, complications of at hero thrombosis, ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease ( Kanse et al., 2008 ; Sidelmann et al., 2010 ;  Parahuleva et al., 2012 ;  Hanson et al., 2012 ). The possible path o physiology of the pro-a the rogen ic e ﬀ ects of FSAP can be activating nuclear factor $\cdot\kappa\mathbf{B}$   (NF $\cdot\kappa\mathbf{B}$  ) pathway and downstream proin ﬂ ammatory factors in circulating monocytes/macrophages, and/or activating bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and cleaving kallikrein analogs resulting in the release of the highly vasoactive bradykinin ( Stephan et al., 2012 ;  Roedel et al., 2013 ;  Parahuleva et al., 2013 ).  

Byskov et al. identi ﬁ ed that FSAP can activate pathways which are related to in ﬂ ammation, apoptosis and cell growth in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and in ﬂ ammation in endo the li al cells (EC) ( Byskov et al., 2017 ). In  $\mathbf{F}\mathbf{S}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{P}^{-\angle}$  mice, increased stroke volume and worsened outcome of stroke were observed, which may be attributed to the lack of activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway ( Joshi et al., 2015 ). Besides, the G534E single nucleotide polymorphism (Marburg I) of FSAP has been linked to late complications of atherosclerosis, carotid stenosis, increased risk for stroke and mortality ( Trompet et al., 2011 ;  Kanse and Etscheid, 2011 ;  Schwarz et al., 2010 ;  Stephan et al., 2011 ).  

The rs11196288A   $>\textbf{G}$   polymorphism has been proved to be related to increased risk of total ischemic strokes and most of its subtypes, such as LAA stroke, SVD and CES, in early-onset patients by a recent GWAS conducted among European population ( Cheng et al., 2016 ). However, another subsequent replicate study conducted by Li et al. only found a signi ﬁ cant association between the rs11196288 and lateonset SVD among Han population in central region of China ( Li et al., 2017 ). Nonetheless, our study showed that the rs1  $1196288\mathrm{A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$  polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of early-onset LAA stroke in all models and late-onset LAA stroke in dominant model. The inconsistency can be explained by several possible reasons. Firstly, there is genetic heterogeneity in di ﬀ erent ethnicities. The minor allele frequencies of the rs11196288 are di ﬀ erent (  $\mathbf{\tilde{G}}=0.39$   for southern Han Chinese;   $\mathtt{G}=0.04$   for European), according to the 1000 Genomes Browser ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/tools/1000 genomes ) and the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) ( https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP /). The results in the study of Li et al. also showed that in early-onset ischemic stroke patients, G allele is a protective factor of LAA stroke, but this association was borderline  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.76$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.57–1.02$  ,    $P=0.067$  ) ( Li et al., 2017 ). The results of this study are consistent with our predictions. Secondly, the phenotype partly depends upon the genotype but can also be in ﬂ uenced by environmental factors. The risk and short-term outcome of stroke mainly be a ﬀ ected by environment risk factors because it is a complex disease. Finally, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions can also a ﬀ ect the susceptibility of the rs11196288 to LAA stroke.  

Our study also has several limitations. Initially, selection bias might be unavoidable because this is a single-center hospital-based study. However, the G allele frequency of the rs11196288 in the controls is

 0.39, which is consistent with that reported in 1000 Genomes Browser

  $\mathbf{\tilde{G}}=0.39$   in southern Han Chinese). Furthermore, some risk factors of stroke incidence and short-term outcome, such as alcohol consumption ( Sung et al., 2016 ), exercise, body mass index (BMI) and dietary structure ( Zhang et al., 2015 ) were not included for further analyses, which may introduce additional biases. Finally, the association between plasma levels of FSAP and the r  $\cdot s11196288\mathrm{A}\;>\;\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism has not been well established. Despite some research showed that the variants rs1338423 and rs7906302, which are in high LD with the rs11196288, were associated with circulating FSAP levels ( Cheng et al., 2016 ). Functional studies are still needed to provide more powerful evidence in the future.  

In conclusion, our results suggested that in Chinese Han population, the rs11196288A   $>\textbf{G}$   polymorphism might be associated with the risk of LAA stroke, but no signi ﬁ cant association between the rs11196288 and short-term outcome of LAA stroke was found. Functional studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms between the rs11196288 and risk of LAA stroke, and well-designed multi center studies in di ﬀ erent ethnicities are warranted to con ﬁ rm and extend our ﬁ ndings in the future.
