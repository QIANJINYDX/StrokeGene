Abstract:  Background and purpose: Data on the association between  PDE4D  SNP 87 and the risk of ischemic stroke  are contentious and debatable. The present meta-analysis was undertaken to systematically summarize the possi­ ble association. Methods: Based on comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and CNKI databases, we identified  18 eligible articles examining the relationship between  PDE4D  SNP 87 and ischemic stroke risk. We evaluated the  strength of relationship using odds ratios (ORs) with  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs). Results: In the overall analysis,  PDE4D  SNP 87 was not found to have effects on the risk of ischemic stroke. The null association persisted in the  subgroup analyses according to ethnicity and sample size. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that  PDE4D SNP 87 may not represent an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke development.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disabili­ ty with a high prevalence among old and very  old people worldwide [1, 2]. There are two sub­ types of stroke: hemorrhagic stroke and isch­ emic stroke [3]. Ischemic stroke characterized  by a sudden decrease in blood flow to one or  more central nervous system areas constitutes   $80\%$   of all strokes. Ischemic stroke is a highly  complex disease composed of various hetero­ geneous disorders attributable to both genetic  and environmental factors [4, 5]. Experimental  evidence demonstrates that genetics should  be responsible for a large part of stroke risk [6].  However, the investigations fail to identify can­ didate genetic factors for the aggressive  disease.  

Several previous studies of an Icelandic popu­ lation used a genome-wide approach highlight­ ed the implication of single nucleotide polymor­ phisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the 5-lipoxy­ genase-activating protein (ALOX5AP or FLAP)  and ph os ph odi est erase 4D ( PDE4D ) genes in  ischemic stroke [7, 8].  PDE4D  located on chro­ mosomal region 5q12 is a very large gene that  spans 1.5 Mb and consists of 8 splice variants,  22 exons, and several hundred SNPs [9].  PDE4D belongs to the large superfamily of cyclic nucle­ otide ph os ph odi est erases and has been report­ ed to be involved in inflammation [10], cell pro­ liferation [11], and migration [12] that could  consequently result in ischemic stroke. A grow­ ing body of replicated reports has sought to  challenge the preconceived findings of the  Icelandic study in diverse populations, showing  conflicting results [13-17]. The relatively small  studies using participants of different ethnic  backgrounds and different analytical methods  may be the major sources of the controversy.  

Among the numerous SNPs (SNP 26, 45, 56,  83, 87, and 89) of  PDE4D  gene, SNP 87  (rs2910829) has been extensively investigated  in ischemic stroke community [18-21]. However,  the efforts did not confirm the susceptibility  role of SNP 87 in ischemic stroke. In this study,  we hypo the ti zed that SNP 87 was associated  with the onset of ischemic stroke. To test this

hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis to  re-evaluate the association between SNP 87  and ischemic stroke.  

# Materials and methods  

Identification and eligibility of relevant studies  

The genetic association studies concerning the  association of SNP 87 and ischemic stroke risk  published before March 2014 were identified  by  comprehensively  searching  PubMed,  Embase and CNKI (China National Knowledge  Infrastructure) databases. The following search  terms were used: (polymorphism) OR (polymor­ phisms) AND (ph os ph odi est erase 4D) OR 

 ( PDE4D ) OR (SNP 87) OR (rs2910829) AND 

 (ischemic stroke). We reviewed the abstracts of  the retrieved studies to examine their appropri­ ateness for inclusion in the meta-analysis.  Then, the full texts of the articles were screened  in order to check their eligibility for the present  study. Finally, all the reference lists of the eligi­ ble articles and the journals known to publish  articles relevant to the current topic were sys­ tem a tic ally reviewed to identify additional pub­ lished articles. The case-control studies pro­ vided the genotype distribution of SNP 87 in  ischemic stroke risk were eligible for inclusion  in the meta-analysis. For studies used the  same series of cases, the latest or the largest  study was considered. Review articles, com­ ment letters, case reports were excluded from  this meta-analysis.  

Data extraction  

Two reviewers independently gathered the data  from each eligible study and reached a consen­ sus on all items. The information required to be  collected was: first author, journal, year of pub­ lication, study country, ethnicity, gender and  mean age of the cases, sample sizes of the

Statistical analysis  

STATA software (version 12.0) was used for all  statistical analyses. Odds ratios (ORs) and  $95\%$    confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to  evaluate the association of SNP 87 and isch­ emic stroke risk.  

A chi-square-based Q test was used to mea­ sure between-study heterogeneity. Statistical  significance was deﬁned at   $\mathsf{P}<0.10$  . In addi­ tion,   $I^{2}$   statistic was calculated to quantify the  proportion of the total variation across studies  due to heterogeneity   $(I^{2}=0\%{\cdot}25\%$  : no heteroge­ neity;  $I^{2}=25.50\%$  : moderate heterogeneity;  $I^{2}=$     $50.75\%$  : large heterogeneity;   $I^{2}~=~75{\cdot}100\%$  :  extreme heterogeneity) [22]. The ORs were  pooled using the ﬁxed effects model (the  Mantel-Haenszel method) [23] when the    $P$    value is above 0.10, and the random effects  model (the Der Simoni an and Laird method) 

 [24] if  $\mathsf{P}<0.10$  . Subgroup analyses by ethnicity 

 (Asian or Caucasian) and sample size (500-  $1000,\,<\,500,\,>\,1000)$   were performed to fur­ ther identify heterogeneity.  

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of the con­ trol groups were checked by a Chi-square test.  A   $P\cdot$  -value   $<\,0.10$   was considered significant.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify  the study modifying the summary ORs. Begg’s

Characteristics of studies  

A flow diagram of the study selection process  for the meta-analysis of SNP 87 and ischemic  stroke is described in  Figure 1 . The original  search provided 223 records. After eliminating  duplications, 187 records remained. Of these,  161 were discarded after reviewing the  abstracts. The full texts of the remaining 26  studies were examined in detail and 8 articles  were further excluded according to the criteria  for inclusion. Therefore, we identified 18  records [13-21, 26-34] with 8,363 cases and  12,223 control subjects for the final meta-anal­ ysis, including 7 records for Caucasian descent,  and 11 records for Asian descent. All 18 arti­ cles were based on a case-control design. The  main information and genotype frequencies for  SNP 87 for ischemic stroke cases and controls  in each of the studies included are summarized  in  Table 1 .

emic stroke risk assuming the homozygote and  heterozygote genotypes, the dominant, reces­ sive and allele genetic models. The pooled  effect estimates among all studies showed that  none of the genetic models were significantly  associated with an increased or decreased risk  of ischemic stroke. However, a tend to increase  ischemic stroke risk was indicated under all of  the contrast models, and the tendency was  more pronounced under the homozygote geno­ types (TT vs.CC, OR, 1.05,   $95\%$   CI, 0.97-1.14,  fixed-effects), the recessive model (TT vs. CT  $^+$    CC, OR, 1.05,  $95\%$   CI, 0.98-1.13, fixed-effects),  and the allele model (T vs. C, OR, 1.03,  $95\%$   CI,  0.97-1.09, random-effects). Meanwhile, neither  the stratified analyses according to ethnicity  nor according to sample size did we find the  association of SNP 87 and ischemic stroke was  significant ( Table 2 ;  Figures 2 - 6 ).  

Test of heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis  

No significant heterogeneity was detected  under all genetic models except for the allele  model   $\mathsf{\backslash P}=0.015$  ,  $I^{2}=47.1,$  ) ( Table 2 ). Subgroup  analyses and sensitivity analyses together  identified the study by He et al. [34] was the  source  of  the  moderate  heterogeneity.  Excluding this study obviously diminished the  heterogeneity and increased the homogeneity  among the remaining studies   $\mathsf{P}=0.816$  ,   $I^{2}=$     $0.0\%)$  . Nonetheless, the corresponding pooled  ORs were not quantitatively altered by remov­ ing any single study.

The diamond corresponds to the summary OR and   $95\%$   CI.  

Publication bias  

Both Begg’s funnel plots and Egger’s test were  performed to determine the publication bias of  the studies included in this meta-analysis. The  shapes of the funnel plot did not indicate obvi­ ous asymmetry under any genetic model  ( Figure 7 ), and the statistical evidence of  Egger’s test suggested no significant publica­ tion bias in the meta-analysis (TT vs. CC:   $\mathsf{P}\,=$    0.905).  

# Discussion  

PDE4D  selectively degrading cyclic AMP that  has effects on the vas cula ture and nervous  system has been implicated to play a pivotal  role in the etiology of stroke [18, 35]. Since the  first study addressing the associations of  PDE4D  SNPs and ischemic stroke risk was  reported [18], an increasing body of research  has been subsequently published to assess  how the  PDE4D  gene SNPs, especially SNP 87,  act in the progress of ischemic stroke [19-21,  31-34]. The investigations failed to reach a con­ sensus on the association between  PDE4D   SNP 87 and the risk of ischemic stroke due to  the small sample sizes. This promoted us to  conduct the current meta-analysis, in an  attempt to assess the controversial associa­ tion through pooling the data supplied by the  eligible studies.

The boxes and horizontal lines represent the OR and the corresponding  $95\%$   CI. The area of the boxes indi­ cates the weight (inverse of the variance). The diamond corresponds to the summary OR and  $95\%$   CI.  

This meta-analysis examined all the available  data on the association between  PDE4D  SNP  87 and ischemic stroke risk, including a total of  8,363 cases and 12,223 control subjects.  Although the pooled results showed that SNP  87 was not associated with the risk of ischemic  stroke, the trend to an increased risk of devel­ oping ischemic stroke was observed. The strati­ fied analyses based on ethnicity and sample  size did not suggest any statistical evidence for  a significant association.  

By comparing the results of the meta-analyses  published before and the present study, we  found an implication of great interest. The ini­ tial meta-analysis published in 2008 investigat­ ing six SNPs (SNP 26, 45, 56, 83, 87, and 89) of  PDE4D  gene suggested that no SNPs examined  in  PDE4D  showed a robust and reproducible  association to ischemic stroke [36]. Similar  results were observed in a following meta-anal­ ysis by Domingues-Montanari and the coauthors [37]. Later, two studies based on 7  datasets and 13 datasets respectively revealed  a significant association between  PDE4D  SNP  83 and ischemic stroke, but not SNP 87 [38,  39]. Taken together, a uniformly non-significant  association was indicated in the four metaanalyses. However, we could draw an interest­ ing conclusion from the five meta-analyses that  the more studies were included, the higher risk  of developing ischemic stroke was indicated in  the results. This implies that the modification

In  conclusion,  we  found from this metaanalysis that SNP 87  of  PDE4D  gene was  not an independent  risk factor for isch­ emic stroke risk. Fur-ther larger rigorous  genetic  association  studies that take ge-ne-gene and geneenvironment interac­ tion into consideration  are needed to provide  conclusive  evidence  for the association be-tween  PDE4D  SNP 87  and ischemic stroke.

effects of SNP 87 are necessary to be further  validated in future larger studies.  

Heterogeneity is an important index to evaluate  the quality of a meta-analysis. Despite some  differences in certain aspects such as study  designs, inclusion criteria for participants, sam­ ple sizes, and ethnic backgrounds, we only  observed moderate between-study heteroge­ neity for the allele model, but not for the rest of  four genetic models. In addition, when we  deleted the study resulting in the heterogene­ ity, no significant alternation occurred in the  corresponding ORs with   $95\%$   CIs, suggesting  our results were statistically reliable.

Some limitations need to be considered when  interpreting the results. To start with, although  we have included all available data on the asso­ ciation of SNP 87 and ischemic stroke, the  sample size does not appear to be sufficiently  large enough to detect the potential relation­ ship. Moreover, ischemic stroke is a multifacto­ rial disease that is caused by the interplay of  genetic and environmental factors, but we are  unable to assess the effects of gene-environ­ ment interaction on ischemic stroke on account  of lacking related data. Finally, only the pub­ lished data were considered in this meta-analy­ sis, and the unpublished or the ongoing studies  were not included, which may have introduced  selection bias.
