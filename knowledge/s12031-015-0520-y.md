Abstract  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 4q25, rs2200733, and rs6843082, associated with ischemic stroke (IS) in Caucasians. However, subsequent validation studies have remained controversial. The current study aims to evaluate the associations between rs2200733, rs6843082, and IS in the southern Chinese Han population. A total of 1632 subjects were recruited in this case-control study. Genotyping for rs2200733 and rs6843082 was conducted in the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform. The genetic association of the rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms with IS was estimated using the PLINK program. Our results show that the SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 have no significant associations with IS in additive, dominant, recessive, and allelic models (all  $p{>}0.050)$  ). However, the results also indicate that the rs2200733 polymorphism is associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in IS patients in both the additive model   $(p_{a d j}{=}0.002)$   and the recessive model   $(p_{a d j}{=}$  0.002) after correcting for age. Meanwhile, the rs6843082 polymorphism showed a significant association with serum total cholesterol (TC) in IS individuals in the additive model  $(p_{a d j}{=}0.017)$  ) and the dominant model   $(p_{a d j}{=}0.023)$  . These findings suggest that the SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 on chromosome 4q25 may be not associated with IS sus ce pti bility in southern Han Chinese. As for IS-related quantitative traits, the rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms might influence SBP and TC in IS patients, respectively.

# Introduction  

Stroke is recognized as one of the major causes of death and adult neurological disability, bringing a heavy socioeconomic burden worldwide (Cern iau ska it e et al.  2012 ; Moz a ff arian et al.  2014 ). More than two thirds of stroke deaths around the world are in developing countries (Feigin  2005 ). In China, it has been reported that almost 2.5 million new stroke cases are diagnosed each year (Johnston et al.  2009 ) and the annual stroke mortality rate is estimated at nearly 157 per 100, 000 (Liu et al.  2011 ); that is, about 1.6 million Chinese people die of stroke each year. However, the pathological mechanisms of stroke are still not well understood. Ischemic stroke (IS) accounts for over  $70\,\%$   of stroke cases in China (Liu et al. 2007 ), and conventional risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, smoking, dys lipid emi a, and atrial fibrillation only constitute about   $60\;\%$   of the e tio logical factors of IS (Dichgans  2007 ) and cannot fully explain the entire risk. As a complex disease, IS is considered a result of the combined effects of multiple genetic and environmental factors (Hassan and Markus  2000 ; Bejot et al.  2007 ; DominguesMontanari et al.  2008 ). Earlier studies on twins and families (Bak et al.  2002 ; Jerrard-Dunne et al.  2003 ) demonstrated that there is a substantial genetic predisposition for IS risk.  

Furthermore, another study reported that genetic risk factors might account for more than  $50\;\%$   of stroke risk (Bevan and Markus  2011 ), which suggests that genetic factors may play an important role in stroke risk.  

Many studies have reported on associations of genetic variants with IS, but the associations have not been consistent, and few determined genes in the general population have been elucidated. Characterized by large sample sizes and rigorous replication, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have made a significant contribution to the identification of potential genetic factors in complex diseases and has provided insights into and a better understanding of the genetic architecture (Hardy and Singleton  2009 ; Pandey  2010 ). Certainly, genetic loci identified by GWAS have become a hot spot of current research on genetics. In 2008, an early GWAS conducted in an Icelandic population identified that the rs2200733 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 4q25 is associated with IS (Greta rs do ttir et al. 2008 ). In 2012, another GWAS analysis in the sample of European ancestry reported that the rs6843082 variant near PITX2  showed a strong risk for card i oem boli c stroke   $(p=$   $2.8\!\times\!10^{-16})$   (Traylor et al.  2012 ). Both SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 are very close to  PITX2  gene which encodes for paired-like home o domain 2, acting as a bicoid-related transcription regulator involved in cardiac development (Mom m erste eg et al.  2007 ). However, the subsequent validation studies of these associations across ethnicities presented inconclusive results. Two cohorts in Germany and the UK showed that rs2200733 is associated with IS (Greta rs do ttir et al.  2008 ), and replication studies in other European populations also found a positive association (Wnuk et al.  2011 ; Bellenguez et al.  2012 ). However, Carty et al. (Carty et al. 2012 ) undertook an analysis of stroke-related GWAS SNPs in the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study and showed a lack of association of rs2200733 with IS in European Americans and African Americans.  

Since genetic heterogeneity may exist among different ethnic populations, GWAS-identified genetic variants should be expanded to other ethnicities for further verification. To date, two studies (Shi et al.  2009 ; Cao et al.  2013 ) failed to replicate the association of the rs2200733 polymorphism and stroke risk in a Chinese population, which were inconsistent with the results obtained in Caucasian populations. In addition, no replication studies exploring the relationship between rs6843082 and IS in the Chinese population have been reported. So, it is essential to replicate the association of rs2200733 and rs6843082 with IS in the Chinese population. In this study, we performed a case-control study to examine whether the GWAS-supported variants rs2200733 and rs6843082 confer susceptibility to IS in a southern Chinese Han population. Additionally, we also investigated IS-related quantitative traits in this Chinese population.  

# Materials and Methods  

Subjects  

A case-control study including 816 IS patients and 816 unrelated controls were investigated. All the IS subjects were consecutively recruited from the Department of Neurology at the First Affiliated Hospital of the Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, China, during the period of July 2009 to June 2014. The diagnosis of ischemic stroke was confirmed by combining the clinical features with radiological examination of the brain (computed tomography scan (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) by at least two experienced stroke neurologists according to the 4th National Conference on diagnostic criteria for cerebro vascular disease. Patients with the following characteristics were excluded: IS caused by other reasons such as car dio embolism, brain trauma, tumors, transient ischemic attacks, and cerebro vascular malformation; with inflammatory disease, collagen os is, or severe heart, liver, renal diseases; uncooperative patients. In the same period, control individuals matched for sex and age were selected from the health checkup center and Department of Orthopedics at the First Affiliated Hospital of the Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine. Control subjects had no clinical evidence of any serious disease in any system of the body. From the control group, we excluded subjects with any history of cerebro vascular and cardiovascular disease (e.g., stroke and coronary artery disease) as well as subjects with autoimmune diseases. Additionally, controls using hormones or immunosuppressant s and ill-matched individuals were also excluded. All unrelated subjects were of self-reported Chinese Han descent. In addition, all participants provided effective written consent after being informed about the topic of this research proposal in detail. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine.  

# Clinical Information Collection and Quantitative Trait Measurement  

Information on general demographic features (e.g., gender, age, and ethnicity) was collected using a unified questionnaire, in which family history as well as the medical history of stroke, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyper lip emi a, and diabetes was also recorded. The measurement of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was taken on the participant ’ s right arm using a calibrated mercury sph yg moma no meter. In the fasting state, two   $5~\mathrm{{ml}}$   tubes of peripheral blood were extracted from the subjects: one tube contained an anticoagulant and the other did not. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cho lester in

![](images/13fe11734f0799ac3b5acf82b81f0cd1fb4c4034736d8b1d9805eb343cd1c76c.jpg)  

(LDL-C) were measured using non-anti coagulated blood specimens on a HITACHI 7600 biochemical auto analyzer.  

# DNA Isolation and Genotyping  

The anticoagulant-containing blood samples were stored at  $4\ \mathrm{{}^{\circ}C}$   and were used for DNA extraction within 7 days. Genomic DNA was extracted using the TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) in accordance with the manufacturer ’ s instructions. DNA samples were stored at    $-80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the primers were designed using Sequenom Assay Designer 3.1 software (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). Primer sequences are shown in Table  1 . Genotyping for the two polymorphic sites was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform. According to the experimental operation procedures, the entire experimental process including primer design, synthesis, and genotype detection was carried out by Bomiao Biological Co., Ltd., Beijing, China. For quality control,  $5\ \%$   of DNA samples were randomly selected for repeated assays; the concordance rate was up to   $100\ \%$  .  

# Statistical Analysis  

Demographic data (e.g., gender, age) between groups were compared by the chi-squared test (qualitative variables) or independent sample  $t$   test (quantitative variables) with SPSS 16.0 for Windows. Genetic association analysis between genotypes and IS was performed using the PLINK program ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/\~purcell/plink/ ). The Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium for genotype frequency distribution of the controls was evaluated by the chi-squared goodness of fit test. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and  $95\ \%$   confidence intervals  $(95\ \%$   CI) for the association between genotypes and IS, and the ORs underwent an adjustment for confounding factors. Single-locus association analysis was estimated under the following genetic models: additive model   $\mathrm{(A_{1}A_{1}/A_{1}A_{2}/A_{2}A_{2})}$  , dominant model   $\mathrm{(A_{1}A_{1}\,+\,A_{1}A_{2}/A_{2}A_{2})}$  ), recessive model  $\left(\mathrm{A}_{1}\mathrm{A}_{1}/\mathrm{A}_{1}\mathrm{A}_{2}+\mathrm{A}_{2}\mathrm{A}_{2}\right)$  , and allelic model   $\left(\mathrm{A}_{1}/\mathrm{A}_{2}\right)$   (  $\mathrm{(A_{l}}$  : minor allele;  $\mathrm{A}_{2}$  : major allele). In addition, genotypic associations between each SNP and IS-related quantitative traits were assessed using linear regression analysis. Haplotype association analysis was performed using PLINK software. The power analysis was conducted using Quanto software ( http://hydra.usc.edu/gxe ). Relevant parameters are set up as follows: For rs2200733, the allele frequency was 0.484, the odds ratio was 1.3, the sample size was 816, the additive model was used, and the prevalence of stroke was 0.019; for 6843082, the allele frequency was 0.267, the odds ratio was 1. 3, the sample size was 816, the additive model was used and the prevalence of stroke was 0.019. Statistical significance was taken at  $p{<}0.05$   using a two-tailed test.

# General Characteristics of the Study Subjects  

The results show that the power of rs2200733 and rs6843082 was 96.22 and   $92.38\ \%$  , respectively. The clinical characteristics of the study participants are summarized in Table  2 . In total, there were 816 IS patients including 465   $(57.00\ \%)$  males and 351   $(43.00\;\%)$   females in the case group, whereas 433   $(53.10\,\%)$   males and 383   $(46.90\,\%)$   females adding up to 816 individuals were in the control group. The average age of the cases with IS was   $65.97\!\pm\!10.50$   years, compared to 65.26  $\pm10.87\$   years for the controls. No significant differences were observed between the case and control groups in terms of sex, age, TC, and TG   $_{(p>0.05)}$  . However, patients with IS had higher SBP and DBP compared with the controls (both

$p{<}0.05)$  . Moreover, significant differences in HDL-C and LDL-C levels were found between the two groups (both  $p{<}0.05)$  .  

Associations of the rs2200733 and rs6843082 Variants With IS  

In this study, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) tests indicated that the genotype distributions of SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 did not deviate from HWE for the healthy controls (both    $p{>}0.050)$  ) (Table  3 ). As shown in Table  4 , we evaluated the association of SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 variants with IS in different inheritance models, including the additive, dominant, recessive, and allelic models. The analysis showed that neither of rs2200733 or rs6843082 showed a statistically significant association with IS, and no statistical differences were observed after adjusting for the relevant factors of age and sex (all  $p{>}0.050$  ). When genotype data were further stratified into male and female subgroups, there were still no statistical associations between SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 and IS in both gender populations (all  $p{>}0.050$  ) (Table  5 ).  

Haplotype Association Analysis  

To further analyze the possible association between IS and SNP patterns, we conducted a haplotype analysis on SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 in the general population, male and female subjects, with or without adjustment for sex and age. As shown in Table  6 , we failed to detect a significant difference for SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 at the haplotype level in the case and control subjects (all  $p{>}0.050)$  .  

Analysis of the Genotypic Association Between the rs2200733 and rs6843082 Polymorphisms and IS-Related Quantitative Traits  

In this study, linear regression analyses indicated that the rs2200733 polymorphism was significantly associated with SBP of IS patients in both the additive and recessive models (additive:  $p_{a d j}{=}0.002$  ; recessive:  $p_{a d j}{=}0.002$  ) after correcting for age, while no statistical differences were detected in DBP and serum TC, TG, HDL, and LDL in the three inheritance models (al  $1p_{a d j}{>}0.050$  ). SNP rs6843082 showed a significant association with serum TC in IS individuals in both the additive and dominant models (additive:  $p_{a d j}{=}0.017$  ; dominant:  $p_{a d j}{=}0.023)$  ), but it did not show statistical associations with SBP, DBP, serum TC, TG, HDL, or LDL (all  $p_{a d j}{>}0.050)$  (Table  7 ).  

Furthermore, we also investigated the effect of rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms on SBP, DBP, serum TC, TG, HDL, and LDL in male and female individuals; the linear regression analysis results are shown in Table  8  and Table  9 . In males, a significant difference was observed between rs2200733 and SBP in IS patients, with or without adjustment for age

 (additive:    $p{=}0.020$  ;  $p_{a d j}{=}0.023$  ; recessive:    $p{=}0.001$  ;    $p$  -

  $_{a d j}{=}0.001)$  ). Additionally, after adjustment for age, rs2200733 was also associated with serum LDL in the dominant model (dominant:  $p_{a d j}{=}0.044)$  ). In females, the rs2200733 polymorphism was associated with serum TC in the recessive model, corrected for age or not (recessive:  $p{=}0.038$  ;    $p_{a d j}{=}0.041$  ). Moreover, we also detected a significant difference between rs2200733 and SBP in female IS subjects (additive:  $p{=}0.044$  ;  $p_{a d j}{=}0.043$  ; dominant:  $p{=}0.018$  ;  $p_{a d j}{=}0.018_{j}$  ). Meanwhile, the rs6843082 variant was associated with serum TC in female individuals (additive:    $p{=}0.019$  ;    $p_{a d j}{=}0.023$  ; dominant:    $p{=}$  0.013; $p_{a d j}{=}0.015)$ ).

# Discussion  

In this study, the results indicate that the rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms on chromosome 4q25 are not associated with IS risk in the southern Chinese Han population. However, SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 were significantly associated with the SBP and serum TC in patients with IS, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first association study of rs6843082 with IS after GWAS, and we performed a further evaluation of the association between rs2200733 and IS in a southern Chinese Han population. In addition, our study with 816 IS cases and 816 controls provided high statistical power, i.e.,   $96.22~\%$   for rs2200733 and  $92.38\ \%$   for rs6843082, which indicates that we had sufficient power to confirm these associations.  

Previous GWAS have implicated that the rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms contribute to the genetic susceptibility to stroke in Caucasians (Greta rs do ttir et al.  2008 ; Traylor et al.  2012 ). Subsequently, a number of replicated studies (Greta rs do ttir et al.  2008 ; Lemmens et al.  2010 ; Wnuk et al.  2011 ; Bellenguez et al.  2012 ; Carty et al.  2012 ) emerged from different ethnic groups. Greta rs do ttir and colleagues (Greta rs do ttir et al.  2008 ) further replicated the association between rs2200733 and IS in two additional cohorts from Germany and the UK. Wnuk et al. (Wnuk et al.  2011 )  

also undertook a case-control study in Polish individuals, and the results showed that SNP rs2200733 is a risk factor for IS. However, in European Americans and African Americans, Carty et al. (Carty et al.  2012 ) could not confirm the association of rs2200733 with IS. A GWAS conducted by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) replicated the significance of the rs2200733 polymorphism and revealed a susceptibility to IS in European and American populations (Bellenguez et al.  2012 ). In general, most subsequent studies showed a positive association of SNP rs2200733 with IS in Caucasians. Meanwhile, there were also two studies conducted in the Chinese population on the association of the rs2200733 polymorphism and stroke risk. Shi and colleagues (Shi et al.  2009 ) performed an assessment of the association of rs2200733 with atrial fibrillation (AF) and IS in the central and northern Chinese population, and the results showed a highly significant risk for AF, but not IS. Another study carried out by Cao et al. (Cao et al.  2013 ) in a central Chinese population also failed to detect the correlation between rs2200733 and stroke. Consistent with the two previous Chinese studies, we also failed to replicate the association of rs2200733 with IS in our southern Chinese Han subjects. For the rs6843082 polymorphism, we could not find repeated genetic association studies exploring the relationship between rs6843082 and IS, but our study shows a negative association

between rs6843082 and IS. Moreover, our results of the haplotype analysis also show no associations of rs2200733 and rs6843082 with IS, which were consistent with the genotype analysis. These results indicate that these two SNPs, rs2200733 and rs6843082, may not contribute to the genetic susceptibility to IS in the Chinese population. A possible explanation for the discrepancy is ethnic heterogeneity in the distribution of the rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms. Based on the HapMap database, we found that the minor allelic frequency (MAF) of rs2200733 is 0.419 in the Chinese Han population in Beijing (CHB), compared to 0.115 in the population with northern and western European ancestry (CEU), while the MAF of rs6843082 is inverted between CEU and CHB. The results imply that there may be a discrepant allelic frequency of the SNPs between the Chinese and European populations, which may lead to disparities in the incidence of stroke.  

Furthermore, there were statistically significant differences in IS-related quantitative traits in the association of rs2200733 and rs6843082 with IS. These results support the important role of several risk factors in IS. A study carried out by Malik et al. (Malik et al.  2014 ) reported that SBP is significantly associated with IS; the estimated heritability of SBP is   $30\;\%$  (Vattikuti et al.  2012 ). A prospective study reported that serum TC is a significant independent risk factor for new thromboembolic stroke (Aronow et al.  1998 ). Thus, we know that SBP and serum TC are common risk factors for stroke. Both the rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms are in close proximity to the  PITX2  gene on chromosome 4q25. It has been suggested that PITX2 isoform c plays an important role in leftright asymmetry (Logan et al.  1998 ) and the development of the pulmonary vein myocardium (Mom m erste eg et al.  2007 ). So, the  PITX2  gene may be to some extent involved in the blood circulation system and may act on IS-related risk factors. Whether SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 influence ISrelated risk factors needs further studies.  

There are some limitations to the present study. First, we did not undertake an association analysis of specific IS subtypes. IS itself has several subtypes, including large-vessel at hero sclerotic stroke (LVD), small-vessel disease stroke (SVD), card i oem boli c stroke (CE), and stroke of other etiology (Adams et al.  1993 ). It is believed that genetic predisposition may vary in different IS subtypes (Markus  2010 ). So, subsequent research on classifying IS subtypes is necessary to further explore the genetics of IS. Second, this study was a hospital-based study, and selection bias was difficult to avoid. Hence, multi-center or population-based studies are warranted in further duplications to better evaluate the associations. Third, this study lacked information on some correlative env iron mental factors such as smoking and alcohol use. IS is considered to be a heterogeneous disorder affected by multiple environmental and genetic factors and their interactions (Hassan and Markus  2000 ; Bejot et al.  2007 ). Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the influence of geneenvironment interactions on IS incidence.  

In conclusion, our findings suggest that the rs2200733 and rs6843082 polymorphisms may not be associated with susce pti bil it y to IS in the southern Chinese Han population. However, we found that the SNP rs2200733 and rs6843082 act as risk variants and could be associated with SBP and serum TC in IS patients. Future explorations with large multi-center cohorts should be conducted in different ethnicities in order to further evaluate the role of rs2200733 and rs6843082 in IS as well as their impact on IS-related risk factors.
