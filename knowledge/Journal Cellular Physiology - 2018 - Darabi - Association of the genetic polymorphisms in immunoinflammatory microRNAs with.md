# Abstract  

Stroke is one of the most common type of cerebro vascular disease threatening human health and life with high mortality, disability, and morbidity. Ischemic stroke (IS) is determined to be a complex disease containing a group of heterogeneous disorders with various environmental and genetic risk factors. This study evaluated the polymorphisms of microRNAs involved in inflammatory routes leading to stroke in an Iranian population. This study evaluated the associations of hsa ‐ mir ‐ 608 C/G rs4919510, hsa ‐ mir ‐ 499 A/G rs3746444, and hsa ‐ mir ‐ 145 C/T rs190323149 polymorphisms in precursor miRNAs with the risk of IS. These microRNA polymorphisms were analyzed in 470 patients with IS and 489 control subjects. The TOAST criteria was applied for IS subtypes classification. The frequency of the allele G of hsa ‐ mir ‐ 499/rs3746444 A/G revealed significant association with IS in comparison with controls   $(p<0.0001$  ,  $\mathsf{O R}=1.838$  ,   $95\%\,{\sf C I}=1.406–2.401)$  . Increased IS risks were associated with hsa ‐ mir ‐ 499/ rs3746444 A/G genotypes in diverse genetic model (homozygote comparison:  $p=0.004$  ,  $\mathsf{O R}=2.136$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}=1.269–3.597$  ; heterozygote comparison:    $p=0.029$  ,   $\mathsf{O R}=1.373$  ,   $95\%~{\mathsf{C l}}=1.033–1.825)$  . Statistical analysis in IS subtypes showed that cardio ‐ embolic patients compared with other subtypes (large artery atherosclerosis and lacunar) had higher frequency of G allele (LAA vs. CEI,  $p=0.017$  ; LAC vs. CEI,  $p=0.009)$  ), AG genotype (LAA vs. CEI,  $p=0.016$  ; LAC vs. CEI,  $p=0.013)$  . Nevertheless, this study did not find any association between the alleles and genotypes of mir ‐ 608 C/G rs4919510 SNP and IS, respectively  $(p>0.05)$  . The current investigation provided verification that hsa ‐ mir ‐ 499 rs3746444 A/G polymorphism may be associated with a significantly increased risk of IS in an Iranian population.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION  

Worldwide, stroke is the second leading cause of death for people over 60 years old (Johnston, Mendis, & Mathers, 2009). About   $80\%$  of strokes are ischemic in origin and   $20\%$   are hemorrhagic (Goldstein et al., 2001). Around  $50\%$   of stroke deaths occur in Asian countries (Nguyen, Fujiyoshi, Abbott, & Miura, 2013). It was shown that the rate of stroke in the North ‐ East of Iran is meaningfully higher than  

the incidence in Western countries and also the age of occurrence in this area is approximately one decade below the world average (Azar paz hoo h et al., 2010). Stroke is a neurological disorder caused by disruption in blood circulation to the brain, which can happen in form of deficiency of blood supply to the cells (ischemic) or caused by flow into brain tissue when a blood vessel ruptures (hemorrhagic; Sacco et al., 2013).  

The type of acute ischemic stroke (IS) was classi ﬁ ed according to the TOAST classi ﬁ cation: (a) large artery atherosclerosis (LAA); (b) cardio ‐ embolic infarct (CEI); (c) lacunar infarct (Tutto lomond o et al., 2009); (d) stroke of other determined etiology (Sacco et al., 2013); (e) stroke of undetermined etiology (UDE).  

IS is a complex disease caused by numerous genetic and environmental factors. Also to the conventional risk factors, such as sex, age, hypertension, body mass index (BMI), smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hyper lipid emi a, single ‐ nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been recognized in genome ‐ wide association studies (GWAS) as susceptible loci for IS risk (Bellenguez et al., 2012; Holliday et al., 2012). Nevertheless, such loci clarify only a small percentage of the entire risk, and a limited number of these SNPs discovered by GWAS involve miRNA genes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of mostly 19 – 22 nucleotide nonprotein coding RNAs that have appeared as key regulators of essential biological procedures through regulating more than one third of human genes by binding to the   $3^{'}$    untranslated region of target gene mRNAs (Pas quine lli, 2012).  

MiRNAs are primarily transcribed as primary miRNAs with several hundred nucleotides, which are further processed into hairpin ‐ structured precursor miRNAs (pre ‐ miRNAs) that have around 70 nucleotides. Pre ‐ miRNAs are the direct precursors of mature miRNAs that have 18 – 25 nucleotides in size (Ha & Kim, 2014). The seed sequence in mature miRNAs (nucleotide 2 – 8) has a significant role in miRNA function (Hogg & Harries, 2014). Growing evidence supports the role of miRNAs in regulating a variety of IS ‐ related biologic processes, such as hypertension, inflammation, at hero scl erosis, plaque rupture, and so on (Rink & Khanna, 2011). MiRNAs are also strikingly expressed in IS, and precise miRNAs have been shown to be associated with the same clinical subtype of stroke that could be used as biomarker for IS (Tan et al., 2009). Of late, it has been suggested that the presence of genetic variants in miRNA genes could impress the processing and successive maturation of miRNAs (Gong et al., 2012), which could cooperatively influence the risk and/or prognosis of diseases.  

Latest investigations and evaluations have shown that the human genome shelter somewhere in the region of 38 million SNPs, 1.4 million small insertion – deletion variants, and beyond 14,000 other structural variants (Consortium, 2012). Until now, GWAS have described associations between almost 1,300 variant loci and over 200 phenotypes, these numbers are rising everyday (Lander, 2011).  

MicroRNAs are studied as main regulators of gene expression involved in different diseases. Several single ‐ nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA genes or target sites (miRNA ‐ related   $\mathsf{S N P s})$  ) have been proved to be associated with human diseases by affecting the miRNA ‐ mediated regulatory function. Until now, thousands of miRNAs in human and other species have been identi ﬁ ed in miRBase database (http://www.mirbase.org). SNPs are significant variations for the diversity among individuals, in addition, leading to phenotypes, traits, and diseases (Cargill et al., 1999; Stan kiew i cz & Lupski, 2010). They are small insertions and deletions (indels) and CNVs (copy number variants) that have been described in our genome. If this genetic variation occurs in regions critical for the correct secondary structure or target binding, it may interfere with normal gene regulation and cause disease. In other words, SNPs located in mature miRNAs (MIRs) are more likely to cause complex in ﬂ uence by affecting MIR maturation process, expression, promoting cell proliferation, functional strand selection, colony formation, and target selection. That is why, existence of SNP in miRNA gene

 (miR ‐ SNP) may have effects on biogenesis and function of miRNAs

 (Sethupathy & Collins, 2008; Sun et al., 2009). Identification of these polymorphisms in populations helps us in recognition of genetic markers involved in complex diseases, which finally should contribute to dealing with them. Such data will be a valuable source for studying miRNA function, in identifying disease ‐ associated miRNAs and further personalized medicine.  

Three miRNA polymorphisms in pre ‐ miRNA sequences (mir ‐ 608 C/G rs4919510, mir ‐ 499 A/G rs3746444, and mir ‐ 145 rs190323149 C/T) have been chosen for our study, in which one of them was found to be associated with the risk and/or prognosis of various diseases, especially with IS in different populations (Y. Liu et al., 2014).  

Remarkably, the three miRNAs also adjust genes associated with inflammation pathways in the circulation system, including tumor necrosis factor ‐  $\cdot\upalpha$   (TNF ‐ α C ‐ reactive protein (CRP; Yang et al., 2011), and annexin A1 (ANXA1; Luthra et al., 2008) methylene tetra hydro folate reductase, which affect vascular damage response. In other words, miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) after treatment with hydrogen peroxide (  $(\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{O}_{2}$  ; Lin et al., 2009). Frequent indications recommended that common SNPs in miRNA sequences, especially some SNPs in pre ‐ miRNAs might be associated with the risk for cancers, asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and congenital heart disease (Z. Liu et al., 2010; Su et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015).  

Cerebral ischemia and in ﬂ ammation are thoroughly interrelated. Ischemia is a vigorous stimulus for possibly harmful in ﬂ ammation, whereas infection and the associated in ﬂ ammation are recognized as risk factors for IS (Hills, Sidney, & Fullerton, 2014). Functional polymorphisms of inflammation pathway genes that affect miRNA may thereby in ﬂ uence the incidence and outcome of IS. Interleukin ‐ 6 (IL ‐ 6) is one of the con ﬁ rmed main pleiotropic proin ﬂ ammatory cytokines related to cardiovascular diseases including stroke, and higher serum IL ‐ 6 has been found in patients with acute IS (Ridker, Hennekens, Buring, & Rifai, 2000). It is well recognized that IL ‐ 6 is associated with at hero sclerotic disease and is thus a significant mediator in the in ﬂ ammatory response to cerebral ischemia. With several studies signifying IL ‐ 6, it can possibly play a vital role in the in ﬂ ammatory response to cerebral ischemia (Smith et al., 2004).  

These selected miRNA targets are related to thrombosis or inflammation pathways in the circulation system. However, sporadic data has been used concerning the role of the miRNA polymorphisms in the pathogen es is of IS. In this study, we pursued to explore the association between the three immuno inflammatory miRNA polymorphisms and the IS risk in an Iranian population.  

# 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# 2.1 | Study population  

Case ‐ control genetic association studies were performed to test the association between genetic polymorphisms of the three pre ‐ microRNAs with genetic susceptibility to IS. The patient group consisted of 470 Iranian patients (243 male and 227 female) with a mean age of 57 years (ranging from 35 to 80 years), who were referred by the  “ Ghaem Hospital ”  during 2011 – 2015. The diagnosis of IS was based on the appearance of a new and abrupt focal neurological deficit, with neurological symptoms and signs persisting for more than   $24\,\mathsf{h r}$  . A diagnosis of IS was established by using the positive findings by head CT or MRI according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD ‐ 9 ‐ CM) code 433 (occlusion and stenosis of pre cerebral arteries), 434 (occlusion of cerebral arteries), and 436 (acute but ill ‐ defined cerebro vascular disease).  

Patients with a history of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, cancer, and coronary heart disease were excluded from this study. At least two neurologists confirmed the diagnosis. The control group was made up of 489 normal individuals (243 males and 246 females) with a mean age of 58 years (ranging from 35 to 80 years). Persons without medical history of cerebro vascular diseases or myocardial infarction were selected as controls during a physical health examination at the hospital, and they were matched with the patients by sex, age, and area of residence. Exclusion criteria were the same as those used in the patient group, as mentioned previously.  

All enrolled patients and controls in this study were unrelated; written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before sampling. This study was approved by the ethics review committee of the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.  

Peripheral blood was collected in EDTA tubes; DNA extraction was done from blood leukocytes by a modified salting ‐ out method.  

# 2.2 | Genotyping  

We extracted DNA from leukocytes using a modified salting ‐ out method, and its concentration was determined using a NanoDrop ® ND ‐ 1000 Spectrophotometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA). The hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499/rs3746444 A/G polymorphisms were defined by polymerase chain reaction – restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR ‐ RFLP) analysis, and another selected polymorphisms hsa ‐ miR ‐ 608 rs4919510 C/G and hsa ‐ miR ‐ 145 rs 190323149 C/T genotyped by polymerase chain reaction – amplification refractory mutation system (PCR ‐ ARMS).  

Primer sequences and reaction conditions have been described in Table 1. Used restriction enzyme (RE) was BCL1 (Catalogue number ER0721), manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific (Fermentase) with the following Cutting site 5 ′ T ↓ GATCA3 ′ . A total volume of   $15\,\upmu\mathrm{I}$  was considered for each reaction, containing   $7.5\,\upmu\mathrm{I}$   of Taq DNA Polymerase  $2\times$   Master Mix Red (Ampliqon A/S, Odense, Denmark),  $1\,\upmu|$   of allele ‐ specific forward prime,  $1\,\upmu\mathrm{I}$   of common reverse primer,  $0.5\,\upmu\mathrm{I}$   of internal control primers,   $0.5\,\upmu\mathrm{I}$   of internal control reverse primer, and  $1\,\upmu\mathrm{I}$   of genomic DNA.  

For genotyping of miR ‐ 499, the PCR products were respectively digested overnight with  Bcl I RE in a   $20\,\upmu\mathrm{I}$   of reaction volume. Restriction fragments   $\left(15\,\upmu\right)$   were separated by   $3\%$   agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide ‐ stained agarose gel and directly visualized under ultraviolet illumination to determine the genotypes. Bcl I for rs3746444 A/G, allele A was cuttable, yielding two fragments of 26 and 120 bp, allele G was uncuttable and still 146 bp. To confirm

the accuracy of the applied method, we randomly selected 20 PCR products to each genotype that were analyzed by direct sequencing (ABI3730xl, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and   $10\%$   of the samples was randomly carried out to repeat the experiment by PCR ‐ RFLP, and the results were   $100\%$   concordant.  

# 2.3 | Statistical analysis  

The normal distribution of data was verified by the one ‐ sample Kolmogorov – Smirnov test. The constant variables were expressed as median (twenty ‐ fifth to seventy ‐ fifth quartile). Demographic and clinical risk factors data between cases and controls were compared by the  $\chi^{2}$    test for categorical variables. Comparison of continuous normally distributed variables was performed by independent  t  test and non ‐ normally distributed variables by the Mann – Whitney test. All the SNPs were detected for the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium among the case and controls using a  $\chi^{2}$    test with one degree of freedom. Genotypic association tests in a case ‐ control pattern assuming codominant (homozygote and heterozygote comparison), dominant, and recessive genetic models were achieved. To evaluate the risk of IS, the odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI) were calculated via multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment for possible cofactors including age, sex, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, BMI, smoking, and drinking. Genotype frequencies in subtypes model (A, B, and C) were evaluated by the  $\chi^{2}$    test. To evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics in relation to TOAST subtypes, multiple comparisons between subtypes and subtypes model (A, B, and C) were performed by the  $\chi^{2}$    test for categorical variables. The one ‐ way ANOVA test for continuous normally distributed variables ( t  test for subtypes model [A, B, and C]), and the Kruskal – Wallis test for non ‐ normally distributed variables (Mann – Whitney test for subtypes model (A, B, and C)). The Conover – Inman procedure was used as post ‐ hoc test to make all possible pairwise comparisons between subtypes. In deviance   $(-2\log$   likelihood) between the models of main effects with or without the interaction term. All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software package version 16 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Two ‐ sided    $p<0.05$   was taken as the level for statistical significance.

# 3.1 | Study population  

The demographics and clinical characteristics of study patients and controls are summarized in Table 2. The patient with IS (243 males and 227 females) had a mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) age of   $57.29\pm10.35$  years. The mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) age of control group (243 males and 246 females) was   $58.19\pm10.23$   years. The difference in history of hypertension, diabetes, HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol was significant between the case and control   $(p<0.05)$  ). The two groups of the study population showed no significant difference in sex, age, BMI, smoking, drinking, and heart disease   $(p>0.05)$  ).

# 3.2 | Pre ‐ miRNA polymorphisms association analysis  

The allele and genotype frequency distribution of three miRNA polymorphism (miR ‐ 499 rs3746444 A/G, miR ‐ 608 rs4919510 C/G, and miR ‐ 145 rs 190323149 C/T) in IS patients and the control group are shown in Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5, respectively. The miRNA polymorphism frequencies are consistent with the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium expectations (Table 4), except for rs 190323149 (HWE  $p=0.014$  , as shown in Table 5). Therefore, The SNP rs 190323149 was excluded in later analysis.  

Two selected microRNA polymorphisms (miR ‐ 499 rs3746444 A/G and miR ‐ 608 rs4919510 C/G) were successfully genotyped in 470 patients with IS and 489 control subjects. Genotype distributions of these two polymorphisms in control and patients were in agreement  $p=0.136$   $\mathsf{r s4919510\ C/G}$  ,  $p\,{=}\,0.326$   for controls and HWE (  $\mathsf{i r s3746444\ A A G}$  ,  $p\,{=}\,0.061$   and   $\mathsf{r s4919510~C/G}$  ,  $p\,{=}\,0.098,$  ) for patients.  

The allele frequencies of these two polymorphisms for patient with IS and control subjects are shown in Table 3. Significantly, increased IS risk was found to be associated with G allele of hsa ‐ mir ‐ 499/rs3746444 A/G compared with the A allele  $(p<0.0001$  ,

Table 4 shows that the genotype frequencies of these polymorphisms were associated with IS risk among cases and controls. We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for rs2910164 and rs11614913 using multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment of general risk factors, including age, sex, obesity, smoking, drinking, HDL, LDL, cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. We found a significant association with the genotype of hsa ‐ mir ‐ 499/ rs3746444 AG genotype (  $736.73\%$   vs.   $32.44\%$  ;    $p\,{=}\,0.029$  ,   $\mathsf{O R}=1.373$  ,  $95\%\mathsf{C l}=1.033–1.825)$  ) and GG genotype (  $\left.0.09\%\right.$   vs.  $0.06\%$  ,    $p\,{=}\,0.004$  ,  ${\sf O R}=2.136$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}=1.269–3.597)$  ) in IS cases compared with those in the controls. Indeed, our results suggested that subjects with rs3746444 AG and GG genotype had a higher IS risk compared with subjects carrying AA genotype in codominant genetic model. Moreover, higher frequencies of   $\mathsf{A G}+\mathsf{G G}$   genotypes (  ${\it46.38\%}$   vs.   $40\%$   $p\,{=}\,0.007$  ,   ${\mathsf{O R}}=1.443$  ,   $95\%$   $;\mathsf{C l}=1.105–1.885,$  ) in a dominant genetic model and (  $.90.42\%$   vs.   $93.86\%\,p\,{=}\,0.036$  ,   $\mathsf{O R}=1.707$  ,   $95\%\,{\sf C I}=1.034-$  2.816) in a recessive genetic model were observed in IS patients when compare with the controls. Any genotype of hsa ‐ mir ‐  $.608/{\mathrm{r}}s4919510$  C/G polymorphism was not significantly different between the stroke patients and controls, even after adjusting full risk factors.  

# 3.3 | TOAST (trial of Org 10172 in acute stroke treatment) classification  

We evaluated the IS subtypes in comparison with each other, according to the existence of difference in risk factors as well as the analogy of each subtypes, with respect to allele and genotype frequency with A, B, and C templates (according to the TOAST classification). Characterization of the stroke subtypes were made based on World Health Organization clinical criteria and according to TOAST classification.  

The IS subtypes are as follows: Large artery atherosclerosis (LAA,  $n=58.$  ), cardio ‐ embolic infarct (CEI,  $n=107.$  ), lacunar infarct (LAC,

Demographic and clinical characteristics of stroke patients in relation to TOAST subtype are listed in Table 7. We observed a significant difference among subjects in hypertension, obesity (BMI higher than 24), LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, NIHSS, and triglycerides   $(p<0.05)$  ). Significant characteristics in relation to IS in LAA group   $(n=58)$  ) are as follows: 22   $(37.93\%)$   had hypertension, 12 (20.68) had BMI   $^{>24}$  , LDL mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 112.65  $(\pm35.41)$  ), total cholesterol mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 192.47  $\left(\pm44.83\right)$  ), NIHSS median (IQR) 4.5 (Nguyen et al., 2013; Tuttolomondo et al., 2009), and triglyceride mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 76.89  $(\pm16.42)$  ). In IS classified as CEI  $(n=107)$  ; 57  $(53.27\%)$  had hypertension, 41 (38.31) had   ${\sf B M I}>24$  , LDL mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 120.67   $(\pm42.4)$  , total cholesterol mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 201.88   $(\pm56.75)$  ), NIHSS median (IQR) 7 (Azar paz hoo h et al., 2010; Pas quine lli, 2012), and triglyceride mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 101.01   $(\pm18.53)$  . In IS classified as LAC   $(n=251)$   $(62.15\%)$   had hypertension, 53 (21.11) had   ${\sf B M I}>24$  , LDL mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 121.01   $(\pm35.38)$  203.29   $(\pm52.62)$  ), NIHSS median (IQR) 5 (Azar paz hoo h et al., 2010; Bellenguez et al., 2012), and triglyceride mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 114.08   $(\pm36.15)$  ; and eventually in IS classified as ODE (  $(n=10)$  , 7  $(70\%)$   had hypertension, 2   $(20\%)$   had  ${\sf B M I}>24$  , LDL mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 153.8   $(\pm58.98)\$  ), total cholesterol mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 268.4   $\left(\pm94.22\right)$  ), NIHSS median (IQR) 7.5 (4.5, 9.25), and triglyceride mean (Zismanov et al., 2016) 213.2   $(\pm85.04)$  . However, all the four groups showed no significant difference in age, sex, diabetes mellitus, HDL, current smoking, drinking, and heart disease   $(p>0.05)$  ).

To compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of stroke subtypes between three main subtypes (LAA, CEI, and LAC), we classified them into three models. The  ${}^{u}\mathsf{A}^{\prime\prime}$   model consisted of stroke patients with CEI and LAA;    ${}^{\alpha}\mathsf{B}^{\prime\prime}$   model consisted of stroke patients with LAC and LAA; and  $"{\mathsf{C}}"$   model consisted of stroke patients with CEI and LAC. When compared CEI group and LAA group, age

Moreover, when LAC and LAA are compared, triglyceride   $(p<0.0001)$   and hypertension  $\left(p=0.001\right)$  ) were significant in LAC group.

Frequencies of patient ’ s genotype based on TOAST classification is shown in Table 8. For comparing the allele and genotype frequencies of rs3746444 A/G between IS subtypes we classified them in three models for evaluation (Tables 9,10). As shown, model A consisted of stroke patients with CEI and LAA. Model B consisted of stroke patients with LAC and LAA, and model C consisted of stroke patients with CEI and LAC.  

Interestingly, patients with IS classified as cardio ‐ embolic infarct (CEI), in comparison with two other subtypes, (CEI vs. LAC and CEI vs. LAA) showed significant difference in G allele (  $.36\%$   vs.  $23.28\%$   in LAA,    $p=0.017\%$   and   $26.3\%$   in LAC,    $p=0.009$  ; see Table 9) and AG genotype (  $.46\%$   vs.   $30\%$   in LAA,    $p=0.016\%$   and   $0.34\%$   in LAC,  $p=0.013$  ; see Table 10) likewise, in dominant model   $(\mathsf{A G}+\mathsf{G G}$   vs. AA). We observed significant difference between CEI in comparison with other subtypes   $\llangle59\%$   vs.   $38\%$   in LAA,  $p=0.01\%$   and   $0.43\%$   in LAC,    $p=0.007$  ; see Table 10).  

# 4 |  DISCUSSION  

Inflammatory processes have fundamental roles in stroke in both the etiology of ischemic cerebro vascular disease and the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia (Tutto lomond o, Di Raimondo, di Sciacca, Pinto, & Licata, 2008). New investigations has revealed many ways in which microRNAs regulate the immune system, which includes regulating the development of immune cells and modulating the adaptive and innate immune responses. Stroke engages both innate and adaptive immunity (Iadecola & Anrather, 2011). It can be presumed that the genetic basis of complex diseases like IS entails numerous predisposing risk factors. Altered expression or function of particular genes and miRNAs comprising thrombotic and inflammation pathways have been recognized in various CNS pathological conditions (Tutto lomond o et al., 2012). MiRNAs are the smallest known ribonucleic acid carriers of extremely specific and genetic regulatory information. They are plentiful extracellular, very soluble nucleic acids existing in multiple human circulatory fluids and serum, and are capable of distributing

genetic signaling information, both pathogenic and homeostatic, among neighboring CNS cells and tissues. In comparison with other organs, the brain has predominantly high proportion of tissue ‐ enriched and tissue ‐ specific miRNAs (Kim et al., 2004; Lagos ‐ Quintana et al., 2002).  

In the current study, we evaluated the role of common SNPs of some microRNAs that participated in various ph y sio pathological processes such as inflammation in patients with acute IS. On this basis, our study supports the hypothesis that immuno inflammatory microRNAs may have an important role in the pathogen es is of IS and subtypes.

In the current study, we assessed the associations between two miRNA polymorphisms and the possibility of IS in an Iranian population. We identified the associations between two genetic polymorphisms in pre ‐ miRNAs and IS risk. Our findings suggested that the allele G and carried G genotypes of hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499 rs3746444 A/G might increase IS risk. In addition, our findings showed higher G allele and AG genotype frequency between cardio ‐ embolic subtypes in comparison with other main subtypes.  

MiRNAs have significant roles in many pathological and physiological processes, comprising proliferation, tumor genesis, metabolism, he mato poi es is, epigenetics, immune function, and neuro degenerative diseases (Wu, Zuo, & Ji, 2012). MiRNAs are furthermore valuable in recognizing the progression of certain neurological diseases (Hu, Ehli, & Boomsma, 2017; Leggio et al., 2017). Growing evidence has showed circulating miRNAs can be unique biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases, including acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, coronary artery disease, acute pulmonary embolism, and stroke (D. Z. Liu et al., 2016; Rink & Khanna, 2011). Also, alteration in the miRNA genes expression are identified to have a role in the pathogen es is of stroke including hypertension, atherosclerosis, neuronal cell death, diabetes mellitus, inflammation, edema formation, and oxidative damage (G. Li et al., 2017; R. Tan et al., 2011; Tana, Gi amber ard in o, & Cipollone, 2017).  

MiRNAs can get involved in many disease ‐ causing processes by providing sequence specificity to RNA silencing pathways. SNPs or genetic variants in the pre ‐ miRNA may influence the property of miRNAs via altering miRNA maturation and/or expression (Guo, Shu, Zhou, & Zhang, 2016). Latest investigations have revealed that pre ‐ miRNAs SNPs might play an essential role in human carcinogen es is and other complex diseases, including IS (Y. Liu et al., 2014). A specific pathological procedure was associated with a certain group of miRNAs, and the expression profile of miRNAs has shown the disease to be state ‐ dependent (Zhou et al., 2011). Recent studies indicated that the common genetic polymorphisms in pre ‐ miRNAs might have significant phenotypic outcomes in IS (Y. Liu et al., 2014).  

Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that miR ‐ SNPs can in ﬂ uence vascular damage responses, and regulate miRNA targets related to thrombosis and in ﬂ ammation pathways in the circulation system (C. ‐ X. Li et al., 2018). In the current study, we detected that the hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499/rs3746444 G allele augmented about a 1.9 ‐ fold IS risk, and the carried G genotypes of rs3746444 enhanced IS risk meaningfully (about 1.4 ‐ fold); parallel consequences were gained by adjusted risk factors. It was shown that the polymorphism (rs3746444 A/G) could have a significant character in inflammation pathways and progression of IS. The hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499 gene was placed on  $20\mathsf{q}11.22$  , and the hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499/rs3746444 A/G polymorphism was placed in the 3p strand in matured miRNA areas, which contained an A to G alteration (Pan et al., 2016). In the other word, rs3746444 is a chief SNP located in the seed sequence (nucleotides 2 – 8) of hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499, comprising of an A to G base alteration (Nikoli ć  $5^{\prime}$  ‐ end of this sequence is essential for miRNA – mRNA binding, hence the rs3746444 polymorphism might influence interactions between miR ‐ 499 and other mRNAs to affect stroke susceptibility (Hou et al., 2015). Several prior studies have reported elevated CRP values in patients with unstable coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and IS (Luna et al., 2014; Rost et al., 2001).  

In addition, many miRNAs were shown to modulate in ﬂ ammatory signaling in cerebral ischemia. A key mechanism by which miRNAs regulate in ﬂ ammation is by targeting the expression of cytokines in the immune cells (Yu et al., 2015). Moreover, it was shown that the polymorphism   $(\mathsf{r s}3746444\ \mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$  ) are closely associated with regulation of CRP; its sticking to targets included IL ‐ 2 receptor B (IL ‐ 2R β ), IL ‐ 2, IL ‐ 17 receptor B (IL ‐ 17RB), IL ‐ 6, IL ‐ 21, IL ‐ 18 receptor (IL ‐ 18R), IL ‐ 23a, T and B lymphocyte attenuator, regulatory factor X4, and peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (http://www.targetscan.org; Baek et al., 2014; Chen, Shao, Gu, Gong, & Zhang, 2017; Song et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2012).  

The rs3746444 A/G polymorphism relationship with IS risk might be associated with inflammation and/or thrombosis pathways in the circulation system. Mentioned polymorphism can cause an alteration from an A:U couple to a G:U mismatch in the stem construction of the hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499 precursor, which changed the expression or function of mature hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499, and regulation of target mRNAs to effect IS risk (Y. Liu et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2017). Likewise, miR ‐ 499 involved IL ‐ 2, IL ‐ 6, IL ‐ 23a, IL ‐ 17RB, IL ‐ 2Rb, and IL ‐ 18R. IL ‐ 6 can trigger the synthesis of CRP and  ﬁ brinogen through the liver (Pepys & Hirsch field, 2003). In addition, IL ‐ 23a, IL ‐ 2Rb, IL ‐ 17RB, IL ‐ 6, IL ‐ 2, and IL ‐ 18R play significant roles in the pathogen es is of stroke (Tsai et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2011). CRP is normally a trace protein that is regulated at the level of transcription, principally by IL ‐ 6, a pleiotropic cytokine with pro inflammatory and anti ‐ inflammatory effects (Nguyen et al., 2013). Furthermore, the rs3746444 A/G may influence both those binding of targets mRNAs to  $3{\mathfrak{p}}$   mature miRNAs and pre ‐ miRNA maturation of 3p and 5p miRNAs (Fernandez et al., 2017; Moszy ń ska, Gebert, Collawn, & Bar to sze w ski, 2017; Omrani et al., 2014). Both of these mechanisms can lead to increased amounts of this miRNA target molecules. Therefore, miR ‐ 499 by increasing the amount of target of these miRNAs targets the genes that may get affected in stroke.  

Also, we found that patients with cardio ‐ embolic strokes, in comparison to other subtypes (LAA and LAC), showed a higher degree of acute neurological deficit at admission evaluated by NIHSS scale. Interestingly, previous studies related to measurement of inflammatory factors in stroke patients have shown that CRP, IL ‐ 6, TNF ‐  $\cdot\upalpha$  , and IL ‐ 1b are significantly higher in the cardio ‐ embolic subtype than other subtypes (Licata et al., 2009; Nakase, Yamazaki, Ogura, Suzuki, & Nagata, 2008). With respect to that, there is not any published study related to the effect of miR ‐ 499 polymorphism on stroke subtypes (at least with our knowledge). Evidence of this study suggests that the presence of G allele and its related genotypes may be associated with elevated levels of inflammatory immune ‐ related factors, such as IL ‐ 6 and CPR in the cardio ‐ embolic subtype, in comparison to other subtypes (Tutto lomond o et al., 2009). The relationship between some inflammatory markers (TNF ‐  $\cdot\upalpha$  , IL ‐ in our study showed that patients with IS classified as cardio ‐ embolic, have a significantly higher G allele and AG genotype frequency in comparison with other subtypes. Therefore, higher levels of G allele and related genotypes in cardio ‐ embolic subtypes of stroke patients can be a reason in increasing the levels of IL ‐ 6 and CRP (G. Li et al., 2017). In other words, CRP amounts can be directly and indirectly influenced by this polymorphism and also an increase in the amount of IL ‐ 6 can do the same (as previously mentioned IL ‐ 6 can stimulate CRP production). Additional previous investigations confirmed that cardio ‐ embolic strokes showed the highest grade of immunoin ﬂ ammatory activation and have worse prognosis, and yield greater and more disabling strokes than other IS subtypes (Grau et al., 1998; Nencini, Sarti, Innocenti, Pracucci, & Inzitari, 2003).  

It has been shown that the carried G genotypes of the rs3746444 A/G were related with increased plasma CRP concentrations, which can raise BMI, blood pressure, triglycerides, and insulin resistance. Thus CRP was a common reason for causing cerebral ischemia (Mirzaei et al., 2017). In addition, our results indicate that cardio ‐ embolic subtypes have higher BMI than other subtypes. Besides, the occurrence age of stroke in this subtype is lower than the other subtypes.  

Our data suggested that allele G and carried G genotypes of hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499 rs3746444 A/G can change the expression or function of mature hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499, and in this way, could have an influence on regulation of potential target mRNAs, including IL ‐ 6 and CRP. In other words, an increase in the amounts of both inflammatory factors can be a potential factor in increasing the risk of stroke (G. Li et al., 2017). In line with our finding, recently a meta ‐ analysis study by C. ‐ X. Li et al. (2018) performed in Chinese population containing 2,632 cases and 3,191 controls showed that hsa ‐ miR ‐ 499  $\mathsf{A}>\mathsf{G}$  (rs3746444) G allele and AG,  $\mathsf{A G}+\mathsf{A A}$   genotype can be viable risk factors of IS in Chinese.  

Mir ‐ 608 rs4919510:  $\mathsf{C}>\mathsf{G}$   is another investigated miRNA in this study. This microRNA was located in 10q24 and the   $\mathsf{r s4919510\,C>G}$  was located in the  $5{\mathfrak{p}}$   strand in matured miRNA area. The effect of mentioned miRNA has been observed in colorectal cancer (Ryan et al., 2012), na so pharyngeal carcinoma (Zheng et al., 2013), and breast cancer (Huang, Yu, Li, Fan, & Shao, 2012). Likewise, it has been demonstrated, this miRNA plays a vital role in the expression of hIL6. Recent investigations found that hIL6 comprise a miRNA binding site inside its ORF, this site is bound by cellular miR ‐ 608, and this bound miRNAs serve to suppress the translation of the respective proteins (Kang et al., 2011). There was no significant association between IS and miR ‐ 608 rs4919510 C > G and it can be because of inability or trivial effect of the mentioned polymorphism in binding to the target molecule (IL ‐ 6). As mentioned above  “ Seed ”  region is very significant in accurate connection and targeting of the microRNAs. The rs4919510 is not in the Seed region, so it can be assumed that the presence of this polymorphism cannot have an important effect on targeting of miR ‐ 608 (Ryan et al., 2012).  

Another investigated miRNA in this study was miR ‐ 145 rs190323149 C/T. MiR ‐ 145 is located at 5p32 chromosomal region and this polymorphism location in the 3p strand is in matured miRNA area (Pashaei et al., 2016). Thus, miR ‐ 145 is one of the most studied miRNAs, especially in the VSMC proliferation, differentiation, and phenotypic switching (Yin, Hamblin, & Eugene Chen, 2015). Jia, Hao, Wang, and   $\mathsf{Q u}$   (2015) in a study on 146 acute IS patients and 96 healthy blood donors found that serum miR ‐ 145 was signi ﬁ cantly increased within   $24\,\mathsf{h r}$   after stroke onset and the serum miR ‐ 23a and miR ‐ 221 decreased in patients. Furthermore, they showed that serum miR ‐ 145 was strongly positively associated with plasma hs ‐ CRP and moderately positively associated with serum IL ‐ 6. Significantly, they demonstrated that the mixture of hs ‐ CRP and serum miR ‐ 145 gained an improved sensitivity or specificity for prediction of acute IS.  

In the cardiovascular system, miR ‐ 145 is not only significant for heart and vascular development but also plays an important role in cardiac pathological factors, such as ischemia and hypertrophy, and has been regarded as a novel therapeutic target for vascular disease. It can be a new biomarker for acute ischemia stroke evaluation (Jia et al., 2015; Lovren et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2015).  

# 5 | CONCLUSION  

As profiling techniques developed, more miRNAs related to stroke were identified. MiRNAs based biomarkers investigations have reported the uses of miRNAs as circulating biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis of stroke (Jickling et al., 2014). Furthermore, target therapy strategies offer a potential solution in the treatment of stroke. MiRNAs may have greater therapeutic potential as candidates for the treatment of stroke rather than as therapies targeting a single gene because of their faster post transcriptional effect and their ability to simultaneously regulate many target genes. Since, a single miRNA can hypothetically bind to and hinder a large number of associated targets; thus, the potential for miRNA modulation in IS is promising (Wu, Zuo, & Ji, 2012).  

Growing indication specifies that aberrant expression of several miRNAs, in equally down regulated and up regulated species, highlight an important role in the neuro protective or pathological procedures of stroke. It has been proved that a single miRNA has a significant influence on cellular task by common suppression and infrequent activation of various downstream mRNA targets. Hence, even limited disorder happening in the miRNA ‐ mediated gene regulation impacts numerous biological pathways involved in both neuro protection and neurodegeneration in stroke brains (Wu et al., 2012). Dys regulated miRNAs in stroke provide proof that miRNA profiles may assist in classifying the subtype of stroke and display possible use as therapeutic targets.  

A comprehensive understanding of miRNAs could likewise profit novel drug development and exploration. Nevertheless, until now, none of the miRNAs targets and induced miRNAs have been effectively authorized in the context of stroke. Moreover, a standard explanation of aberrant miRNAs and the technology used in diverse investigation al stages have not been standardized, therefore ample effort is still mandatory (Mirzaei et al., 2017). We need to clarify the whole conception of regulated transcription factors, mRNAs, proteins, and miRNAs; and the intricate association between them is of utmost significance. We have belief that supplementary understanding of aberrant miRNAs in stroke can help stroke management in future in a multifaceted way, as they do play an important role in the process of stroke path o physiology. Likewise, with growing indication that miRNA serve as biomarkers of disease, an ongoing research in this area may lead to innovative miRNA ‐ based therapies for prevention and/or treatment of neuro developmental and neuro pathological disorders (Hollins & Cairns, 2016).  

There are some limitations in the current investigation. (a) It is not yet obvious which genetic polymorphisms forecast the phenotypes related to IS. Our study population included just Iranian individuals, and our conclusions will need confirmation by other ethnic groups. (b) This study was a hospital ‐ based case ‐ control that had somewhat small sample size of individual IS. Control subjects were not engaged from an entirely healthy people as some of them were looking for medical care. Therefore, it is not easy to find the casual influences of vascular risk factors in these subjects. Then, based on selection bias, our consequences might miscalculate the right impression of individual risk factors. (c) Altogether, our study subjects had brain imaging and were established to be negative for symptomatic brain lesions, thus augmenting the diagnostic accurateness and precise case ‐ control grouping. Although a population ‐ based work may be ideal to decrease the selection bias or referral, it is hard to get adequate numbers of stroke cases as the expected annual occurrence of stroke is low in the overall population. (d) In this study, inflammatory factors involved in the targeting of miR ‐ 499, including IL ‐ 6 and CRP, have not been measured. Measuring these factors could have augmented our hypothesis in showing that these factors can influence the IS. (e) Our consequences cannot be generalized to other races for the reason that inter ethnic variability in the incidence of stroke subtypes and genotypes may give diverse outcomes. (f) Lastly, stroke subtypes classified according to etiologic classifications, TOAST criteria, may not be not   $100\%$   reliable.  

The rs3746444 A/G polymorphism was related to IS by elevating the concentrations of IL ‐ 6 and consequently CRP, which is one of the common reasons of cerebral ischemia. Rs3746444 may also be associate with apoptosis and cell death. Thus, this SNP may be associated in IS subsequent anoxia and ischemia along with thrombosis and/or inflammation pathways through IL ‐ 2R β , IL ‐ 2, IL ‐ 6, IL ‐  IL ‐ 18R, 17RB, IL ‐ 23a IL ‐ 21, and target factors in the circulatory system. The rs3746444 GG genotype possibly will consequently rise the morbidity of IS via affecting inflammation and/or thrombosis pathways in the circulation (Jeon et al., 2013; Xiang, Fan, Cao, Huang, & Zhang, 2012).  

In conclusion, the G allele and AG genotype of the hsa ‐ mir ‐ 499/ rs3746444 polymorphism was associated with an augmented risk of IS in the Iranian population, which can be used as candidate biomarkers for IS susceptibility. Nevertheless, the comprehensive function of hsa ‐ mir ‐ 499 SNPs and their redundancy or compensation al role in IS were unidentified, and the subject warrants additional investigations in vitro and in vivo to be confirmed. This study for the first time report an association between stroke miRNA polymorphisms   $(\mathsf{m i R.499\,A}>\mathsf{G})$   in the Iranian population. Hence, supplementary studies of other ethnics with respect to the biological roles of miRNA are required to entirely realize the function of miRNA polymorphisms in IS risk.  

Except nutrition, lifestyle, clinical characteristic background, immuno inflammatory factors it can be declared that polymorphism of the microRNAs, can be a predisposing factor in causing stroke and its severity also, emphasizing the amount of inflammatory response to IS can be varied in different humans with different genetic backgrounds. Future studies will gradually improve our knowledge in the field of genetic polymorphisms in acute IS practice. Using a combination of miRNA polymorphisms, circulating miRNA expression, immuno inflammatory biomarkers, and infarct volume and site, can be a feasible strategy to improve the diagnosis of stroke subtypes in an acute phase to help refine the choice of therapy and to accelerate the start of optimal secondary prevention.
