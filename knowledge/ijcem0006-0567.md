Abstract:  Background: Matrix metal lo protein as e 10 (MMP10) plays an important role in ischemic stroke and has a  close relationship with some stroke risk factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between  two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the exon regions of the  MMP10  gene and a the roth rom bot ic cerebral  infarction risk. Methods: Five hundred and thirty-seven hospital-based patients who had suffered first a the roth rom­ botic cerebral infarction and 580 unrelated healthy controls were enrolled. Demographic and clinical features of  the subjects were recorded, and two polymorphisms, rs17435959   $_{\left(\mathsf{G}>\mathsf{C}\right)}$  , rs17293607   $(\mathbb{C}^{>\top})$   were chosen to be  genotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction-restriction TaqMan probes using the ABI 7300 TaqMan platform.  Results: There were several clinical parameters, such as blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol,  homo cyst eine, as well as carotid plaque and smoking, but not average age and sex ratios that showed significant dif­ ferences between patients and control subjects. For rs17435959, there was no significant difference between the  ischemic stroke group and the healthy control group in genotype frequency   $.08{=}1.295$  ,    $\scriptstyle P=0.187$  ,  $95\%$   CI (0.882- 1.899)) or allele frequency (  $\mathsf{O R e I.267}$  ,  $P{=}0.202$  ,  $95\%$   CI (0.881-1.823)). Moreover, in smoking, none smoking, hav­ ing carotid plaque, no carotid plaque, male or female subtypes, there was significant difference between patients  and control subjects in genotype frequencies or allele frequencies. The minor allele frequency of rs17293607 was   $0.92\%$  , prohibiting further study of this allele. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the rs17435959 SNP may  not associated with a the roth rom bot ic cerebral infarction risk. We also found that rs17293607 is not polymorphic  in our study population.

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke has become one of the leading  causes of morbidity and mortality in China and  has an increasing incidence year by year, in  which a the roth rom bot ic cerebral infarction is  one of the most common. If timely and effective  interventions cannot be carried out, the  Chinese people and China’s economy will suf­ fer heavy healthcare burdens [1].   There are  many well-documented and modifiable risk fac­ tors for stroke, such as hypertension, diabetes,  dys lipid emi a, atrial fibrillation, a symptomatic  carotid stenosis, smoking, and so on [2]. Among  these factors, carotid atherosclerosis has a  close association with the incidence and recur­ rence of ischemic stroke [3]. Carotid athero­ sclerosis can lead to a direct infarction at the  narrowest part of the constricted vessel, or an  unstable plaque can have an unpredictable  sudden breakage, rupture, fissure or ulceration  that leads to platelet activation, thrombosis,  shedding and the obstruction of the distal vas­ culature [4].  

Matrix metal lo protein as es (MMPs), a family of  more than twenty endo pep tid as es, play a cen­ tral pathologic role in stroke by degrading ECM  substrates that are essential for normal signal­ ing and homeostasis within the neuro vascular  unit [5]. Moreover, the degradation of ECM sub­ strates causes the loss of ECM components,  leading to a thinning of a plaque’s fibrous cap,  exposing the lipid-filled core, making the plaque  more unstable, and leading to the obstruction  of the distal vas cula ture [6, 7].  

Matrix metal lo protein as e 10 (MMP10) plays a  role in a wide range of substrate cleavage,  include collagen, gelatin, nestin, laminin, pro­ teoglycans and elastin. MMP-10 can also acti­ vate pro-MMP-1, pro-MMP-7, pro-MMP-8 and  pro-MMP-9, which then degrade extracellular  collagen in different pathological conditions  together with other MMPs [8].   MMP10 is nota­ bly increased in neurons of the ischemic brain  but not in healthy areas [9]. However, unlike  most MMPs, it can effectively reduce infarct  size in experimental stroke by enhancing fibri­ nolysis via a thrombin-act iv a table fi bri no lysis  inhibitor mediated mechanism [10], which indi­ cates that MMP10 may have a novel profibrino­ lytic role in ischemic stroke. Besides, serum  MMP10 levels also has a close relationship  with some risk factors for ischemic stroke, such  as carotid intima-media thickness, the pres­ ence of carotid plaques, inflammatory markers  and smoking [11-13].  

Some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  of other  MMP  genes are thought to have some  relationship with the risk of ischemic stroke  and carotid atherosclerosis [14, 15]. However,  to our knowledge, studies that definite relation­ ships between the SNPs in  MMP10  gene and  ischemic stroke, or regard the structure of  MMP10 protein since the SNPs produce amino  acid changes which may have different roles on  MMP10 secretion and activation have not been  established. The rs17435959 SNP causes a  leucine (Leu) to valine (Val) transition at codon  4 in exon 1 of the  MMP10  gene, and rs1729- 3607 leads to a transition of glycine (Gly) to  arginine (Arg) at codon 65 in exon2 of the gene.  These two polymorphisms lead to the substitu­ tion of specific amino acids and may have func­ tional effects. After studying the relationship  between a number of MMPs and carotid  plaques or a the roth rom bot ic cerebral infarc­ tion [16-18], we now focus on whether these  two SNPs have a relationship with the risk of  a the roth rom bot ic cerebral infarction in a hospi­ tal-based patient cohort.  

# Materials and methods  

Study subjects  

Between April 2010 and March 2012, 537 hos­ pital-based first-time a the roth rom bot ic cere­ bral infarction subjects were recruited from the  Department of Neurology, while 580 unrelated  healthy controls were identified at our hospital  at the same time. The symptomatic stroke  patients were confirmed to have a the roth rom­ botic cerebral infarction s with brain imaging  using a computed tomography scan (CT) and/or  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  

The following exclusion criteria were used in our  study: 1) to ensure the subjects suffered stroke  because of vascular disease instead of blood  or heart problems, patients with atrial fibrilla­ tion, cardiac valve abnormalities, recent myo­ cardial infarction (3 months), heart failure,  recent cerebral hemorrhage (3 months), recent  surgery (3 months), severe liver disease, renal  failure, he mato logic or autoimmune diseases,  or pregnancy were excluded; 2) patients with a  history of tumors, chronic inflammatory diseas­ es, autoimmune diseases or aneurysm, were  also excluded because we could not be sure  whether the two SNPs have a relationship with  the susceptibility to these uncommon disea-ses.  

The Medical Ethics Committee of Taizhou Hospital approved the study and all participants  provided written informed consent.  

# Data collection  

Among the obtained clinical data, age, sex and  race were determined from the patient’s ID  card, while smoking and drinking status were  self-reported. Height and weight were mea­ sured to calculate the body mass index (BMI),  reported as weight (kg)/height 2    $(\mathsf{m}^{2})$  . Blood  pressure was measured three times on the  screening day, and the average systolic blood  pressure (SBP) and the average diastolic blood  pressure (DBP) were used in the analyses.  Blood samples were obtained early in the morn­ ing without fasting after last supper. In these  samples, fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cho­ lesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipo­ protein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipopro­ tein cholesterol (LDL-C), uric acid, hypersen-sitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), fibrinogen

and homo cyst eine concentrations were mea­ sured at the clinical laboratory of our hospital.  Carotid ultrasound examinations were per­ formed in pre-defined areas, including the right  distal common carotid artery, left distal com­ mon carotid artery, right bulb, left bulb, right  proximal internal carotid artery and left proxi­ mal internal carotid artery using a 7–12 MHz  scanning frequency ultrasound machine in  B-mode (Sonos 5500; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA,  USA), and subjects were classified as “having  plaque(s)” or “no plaque”, according to the  scanned images and previous ultrasonic crite­ ria [19].  

TaqMan® SNP-Genotyping Assays  

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole-blood  samples using the Blood Genomic DNA Isolation  Mini Kit (Shanghai General Biotech Co., Ltd,  Shanghai, China) according to the manufactur­ er’s protocol. The DNA concentration was deter­ mined by absorption at 260 nm in a  Bio Photo meter Plus (Eppendorf, Hamburg,  Germany). All DNA samples were frozen at   $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until use.  

Genotyping was performed with real-time poly­ merase chain reaction-restriction TaqMan  probes using the ABI 7300 TaqMan platform  (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California,  America) according to the manufacturer’s pro­ tocol. TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and  the 40 X SNP Genotyping Assay was also from  Applied Biosystems (ABI). ABI’s assay ID  C_22274980_10 is for the SNP ID rs17435959  while C_25628162_20 is for rs17293607.  Allelic discrimination was automatically com­ pleted using the Sequence Detection System  1.4.0 software with  $\mathtt{100\%}$   concordant. Ten per­ cent of the DNA samples were randomly select­ ed to repeat the assay to confirm consistency,  and genotyping operators and allelic recorders  were blind to the clinic data of each sample.  

Statistical analysis  

Statistical analysis was performed using the  SPSS 18.0 software package. Data are  presented as the mean±standard deviation (for  normal variables) or median (  $25\%$   quartile,   $75\%$    quartile) (for skewed variables) or percent  frequency. Student’s t test (for normal variables)  or Mann-Whitney test (for skewed variables)  was used to compare measurement data  between two groups, while a chi-square test  was used for count data.

# Results  

Demographic and clinical features of the study  subjects are summarized in  Table 1 . There  were no statistically significant differences  between the two groups in average age and sex  ratios. However, there were several clinical  parameters that showed significant differences  between the two groups. Subjects in the isch­ emic stroke group had higher SBP, DBP, FBG,  TG, TC, Hs-CRP and homo cyst eine, as well as  more carotid plaques. The stroke group also  included more smokers and alcohol drinkers.  

The logistic regression analysis showed that  higher level of SBP, FBG, Hs-CRP, homocyste­ ine, more carotid plaque(s), and smoking were  risk factors for the ischemic stroke group com­ pared to the healthy control group, as listed in  Table 2 .  

The results of the polymorphism validation  show that rs17293607 is not polymorphic in  our study population, as it’s minor allele fre­ quency was   $0.85\%$  , leading us to cease the

The genotype and allele frequencies of  rs17435959 in the ischemic stroke group and  healthy control group are shown in  Table 3 . The  observed genotype frequencies were at HardyWeinberg equilibrium   $\!P\!\!=\!\!0.441$   for the isch­ emic stroke group,   $\scriptstyle{P=0.153}$   for the healthy  control group).   There was no significant differ­ ence between the ischemic stroke group and  the healthy control group in genotype frequen­ cy (  $11.7\%$   vs.   $9.3\%$  ,   $\scriptstyle P=0.187$  ,  $\mathsf{O R=}\mathsf{1.295}$  ,   $95\%$    CI (0.882-1.899)) or allele frequency   $(6.1\%$   vs.

 1.823)). Moreover, in smoking, none smoking,   having carotid plaque(s), no carotid plaque,  male, or female subtypes, there was no signifi­ cant difference between patients and control  subjects in genotype frequencies or allele fre­ quencies ( Tables 4 - 6 ).  

# Discussion  

In the present case-control study, we investi­ gated the relationship between a  MMP10  gene  polymorphism, rs17435959, and a the roth rom­ botic cerebral infarction risk. We found that the  genotype and allele frequencies were not asso­ ciated with a the roth rom bot ic cerebral infarc­ tion risk in the total cohort of patients or in sub­ type analysis.  

Stroke is creating a heavier and heavier human  and economic burden in China and the world. In  China, approximately 2 million people have a  stroke each year, 1.5 million people die of  stroke annually, and 7 million people are stroke  survivors, among which three quarters lose the

ability to work. Approximately   $\not=20$   billion per  year is spent to the diagnoses and treat stroke  [21]. In the United States, approximately  795,000 people have a stroke each year, of  which approximately 610,000 are a first attack,  resulting  in  134,000  deaths  annually.  Approximately 6.4 million Americans are stroke  survivors, and the cost of stroke was  $\oint34.3$   bil­ lion (direct and indirect costs) in 2008 [22].  Increasing stroke incidence may be caused by  several factors, including the uncontrolled risk  factors, the aging population, the unhealthy  lifestyles, or the unknown complicated patholo­ gies of stroke. No biomarkers or genetic mark­ ers exist for early diagnosis, which makes the  search for susceptibility genes a hot topic in the  field.  

Because MMP10 plays an important role in  ischemic stroke and has a close relationship  with some stroke risk factors, our study focused  on two missense mutations in its exon regions:  rs17435959 and rs17293607.   Our data shows  that for rs17435959, the minor allele frequen­ cy was   $4.9\%{\sim}6.1\%$  , and for rs17293607, the  minor allele frequency was   $0.92\%$  . The minor  allele frequency of rs17435959 is similar to  Hlatky’ study   [23]   $(4.9\%{\sim}6.1\%$   vs.   $4.0\%{\sim}5.1\%$  ).  However, the T allelic frequency of rs17293607  is quite different   $(0.85\%$   vs.   $10.4{\sim}12.5\%)$  ,  which may be caused by European and Han  Chinese ethnic populations having a different  mutation frequency.  

Our data shows that there was no significant  difference between the ischemic stroke group  and the healthy control group in genotype fre­ quency   $(11.7\%$   vs.   $9.3\%$  ,   $\mathsf{P{=}0.187}$  ,   $\mathsf{O R=}\mathsf{1.295}$  ,   $95\%$   CI (0.882-1.899)) or allele frequency   $(6.1\%$    vs.   $4.9\%$  ,  $\mathsf{P{=}0.202}$  ,   $\mathsf{O R e I.267}$  ,   $95\%$   CI (0.881- 1.823)) in the total cohort of patients. Moreover,  there was no significant difference between  patients and control subjects in genotype fre­ quencies or allele frequencies in the four sub­ types divided by the risk factors (smoking and  carotid plaque) which are both association to  MMP-10 and ischemic stroke.   These findings  may be cause by several reasons. Firstly, isch­ emic stroke itself should be thought of as a syn­ drome rather than a specific disease and can  be caused by a number of different path o logie s  [24], so one or even several variants in one or  several genes can not show significant relation­ ship with ischemic stroke. Secondly, according  to the study of Orbe J et al [10], MMP10 can  reduce infarct size in experimental stroke,  which it plays a protective role in the pathology  of stroke. However, according to the studies of  Montero I et al [11], Orbe J et al [12] and Paramo  JA et al [13], higher serum MMP10 levels are  associated  with  inflammatory  markers,  increased carotid intima-media thickness, the  presence of carotid plaques, and smoking in  a symptomatic subjects, in which smoking,  increased carotid intima-media thickness and  the presence of carotid plaques are universally  acknowledged to be the risk factors of ischemic  stroke. So the role of MMP10 in the pathogen­ esis of stroke is still uncertain, which may leads  to the lack of association between  MMP10   polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk.  Thirdly, given   the rarity of the minor (C) allele,  the limited sample size of this study may not  completely exclude that this polymorphism may  be a risk factor for ischemic stroke.  

Our data also shows that hypertension, diabe­ tes, dys lipid emi a, carotid atherosclerosis,  smoking, and higher level of Hs-CRP and   homo­ cysteine were risk factors for stroke, which is  consistent to traditional view and the extensive  evidence. More attention should be pay to  these well-documented and modifiable risk fac­ tors for the primary prevention of stroke [2].  

In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first  study about the association of SNPs of  MMP10 with a the roth rom bot ic cerebral infarction in a  Han Chinese population.   Our findings suggest  that the rs17435959 SNP may not be associ­ ated with a the roth rom bot ic cerebral infarction  risk, that rs17293607 is not polymorphic in our  study population. However, our study has some  limitations, including the few SNPs studied, the  limited sample size, and the rarity of minor  alleles of our SNPs. More studies are needed to  focus on the association of variants in  MMP10 gene with the risk of a the roth rom bot ic cerebral  infarction in diverse ethnic populations.
