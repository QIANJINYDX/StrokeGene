Abstract:  The present study was performed to clarify the association between the   acyl-CoA:cholesterol ac yl transfer as e-1 ( ACAT-1 ) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  rs1044925 and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS) in   the Guangxi Han population. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length  polymorphism was performed to determine the genotypes of the  ACAT-1  SNP rs1044925  in 1730 unrelated subjects (CAD, 587; IS, 555; and healthy controls; 588). The genotypic  and allelic frequencies of rs1044925 were significantly different between the CAD patients  and controls   $(p\,=\,0.015)$   and borderline different between the IS patients and controls    $(p=0.05)$  . The   $\mathrm{AC/CC}$   genotypes and C allele were associated with a decreased risk of  CAD and IS (CAD:  $p=0.014$   for AC/CC  vs . AA,  $p=0.022$   for C  vs . A; IS:  $p=0.014$     for AC/CC  vs . AA;  $p=0.017$   for C  vs . A). The   $\mathrm{AC/CC}$   genotypes in the healthy controls,  but not in CAD or IS patients, were associated with an increased serum high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration. The present study shows that the C allele  carriers of  ACAT-1  rs1044925 were associated with an increased serum HDL-C level in the  healthy controls and decreased risk in CAD and IS patients.

# 1. Introduction  

Cholesterol is present in the membranes of all mammalian cells and is needed for their growth and  viability. Excess cellular cholesterol is stored as cho lester yl esters (CEs). In most cell types, CEs are  present only in low levels, mainly as cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Chronic accumulation of CE in  macrophages causes these cells to appear foamy and is a hallmark of early-stage atherosclerosis [1].  The formation of CEs is catalyzed by the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A (CoA):cholesterol ac yl transfer as e  (ACAT) [2]. There are two isozymes of ACAT, ACAT-1 and ACAT-2, with different intracellular  localization, membrane topology in mammalian species, and metabolic function for each enzyme [3–5].  ACAT-1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and cells, including the brain, adrenal glands,  kidneys [6–8], and macrophages [9], and is responsible for foam cell formation in macrophages,  whereas ACAT-2 is expressed only in the intestines and liver [3,4,10] and regulates cholesterol  absorption in intestinal mucosal cells [11]. Therefore, p harm a co logical inhibition of ACAT is expected  to suppress foam cell formation in arterial walls by suppressing macrophage ACAT-1 and cholesterol  absorption by suppressing intestinal ACAT-2, thereby inhibiting atherosclerosis [12].  

A number of animal studies have suggested that ACAT inhibitors might be promising drugs for  controlling hyper lipid emi a and atherosclerosis [12,13]. However, a drug that inhibits ACAT activity  could cause a mild increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and in the incidence of  major cardiovascular events in humans [14–16]. For an isoform of ACAT, ACAT-2 has been proven to  be a protective factor in atherosclerosis in animal models [17,18]. Although, whether attenuating  ACAT-1 can improve atherosclerosis is under debate, Yagyu  et al . [19] showed that ACAT-1  inhibition in tissue macrophages is protective against CE accumulation, thereby attenuating  atherosclerosis. However, in LDL receptor- or apoE-knockout mice, selective deficiency of the   ACAT-1 isoform resulted in larger at hero sclerotic lesions [20]. Further studies in hyper lipid emi a  models showed that the detrimental effects of  ACAT-1  deficiency were attributed to increased  macrophage apoptosis caused by a massive accumulation of free cholesterol and impaired cellular  cholesterol efflux [21–23]. Therefore, the role of  ACAT-1  in atherosclerosis remains to be clarified.  

To our knowledge, the genetic evidence on the association between  ACAT-1  variants and  atherosclerosis in humans is poor. In a previous study, we have found that the  ACAT-1  SNP   rs1044925 modulated the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration in the  hyper cholesterol emi c subjects [24], suggesting that rs1044925 influences the cellular cholesterol   efflux in hypercholesterolemia and plays an important role in the formation of atherosclerosis.  Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether the  ACAT-1  SNP rs1044925 is associated  with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS).

# 2.1. General Characteristics and Serum Lipid Levels  

The baseline characteristics of the patients with CAD or IS and the controls are shown in Table 1.  The mean age, male to female ratio, serum LDL-C and apo lipoprotein (Apo) B levels and the  percentages of subjects who smoked were similar between the controls and CAD patients and between  the controls and IS patients. The average body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure, pulse  pressure, and serum triglyceride (TG) levels were significantly higher and serum total cholesterol  (TC), HDL-C, Apo AI, ApoAI/ApoB ratio and the percentages of subjects who consumed alcohol  were significantly lower in the CAD and IS patients than in the controls.

# 2.2. Genotypic and Allelic Frequencies  

The frequency of the A and C alleles was   $84.2\%$   and   $15.8\%$   in the controls,   $87.5\%$   and   $12.5\%$   in the  CAD patients, and   $87.7\%$   and   $12.3\%$   in the IS patients respectively (Table 2). The frequency of   the AA, AC and CC genotypes was   $70.1\%$  ,  $28.2\%$   and  $1.7\%$   in the controls,   $77.0\%,21.0\%$   and  $2.0\%$   in  the CAD patients, and   $76.4\%$  ,   $22.5\%$   and   $1.1\%$   in the IS patients respectively. The genotypic and  allelic frequencies were different between the control and CAD patients and between the controls and   IS patients. The genotypic and allelic frequencies were concordant with those predicted by the   Hardy-Weinberg proportions in both experimental groups   $(p=0.292$   for CAD and   $p=0.336$   for IS)  and controls   $(p=0.145)$  .

# 2.3.  ACAT-1  SNP rs1044925 and the Risk of CAD and IS  

The C allele was associated with a decreased risk of CAD (adjusted Odds ratio   $(\mathrm{OR})=0.76$  ,   $95\%$    confidence interval  $(\mathrm{CI})=0.60–0.96$  ) and IS (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}=0.75$   $5,95\%\;\mathrm{CI}=0.59–0.95)$  ) (Table 2). The  AC and   $\mathrm{AC/CC}$   genotypes were also associated with a decreased risk of CAD (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.67$  ,   $95\%\;\mathrm{CI}=0.50–0.91$   for AC  vs . AA and adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.69$  ,  $,95\%\;\mathrm{CI}=0.52–0.93$   for AC/CC  vs . AA)  and IS (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}~=~0.72}$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\;=\;0.54–0.95$   for AC  vs . AA and adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}~=~0.71}$  ,    $95\%\,\,\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.54{-}0.93$   for AC/CC  vs . AA). Stratified analysis showed a decreased risk of CAD in  subjects with an AC/CC genotype, mainly in those who belonged to one of the following groups: high  BMI (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.57$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.36–0.91$  ), males (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.71$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.50–1.00$  0),  nonsmokers (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}\;=\;0.63}$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\;=\;0.42–0.94)$  ) and nondrinkers (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}~=~0.66}$  ,    $95\%\;\mathrm{CI}=0.47–0.93)$  ). There was a decreased risk of IS in subjects with an AC/CC genotype, mainly in  those who belonged to one of the following groups: high BMI (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.53$   $3,95\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=0.34{-}0.84$  ),  males (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}\ =\ 0.69$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}~=~0.50{-}0.95)$  ) and nondrinkers (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}~=~0.68,}$  ,    $95\%~\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.49{-}0.95$   Table 3). No significant interaction was detected between the genotypes and   these factors.

# 2.4. Related Risk Factors for CAD and IS  

Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the incidence of CAD and IS positively correlated with  BMI, diabetes, hypertension and hyper lipid emi a and negatively correlated with the rs1044925 AC/CC  genotypes and alcohol consumption (Table 4).

The HDL-C levels were different between the AA and AC/CC genotypes in the controls   $(p=0.038)$    but not in the CAD and IS patients (Table 5). The controls with an AC/CC genotype had an increased  serum HDL-C level compared to the controls with an AA genotype.

# 3. Discussion  

Despite therapeutic advances that control many risk factors, such as LDL-C, to levels lower than  previously possible, death from cardiovascular disease continues to increase worldwide. Statins   have reduced the risk of complications and death from cardiovascular causes by only approximately  one third, leaving the remaining two thirds of patients unprotected [25]. Accordingly, the quest for  p harm a co logic agents that target other steps in at hero genesis has intensified in recent years. ACAT has  been considered to be a promising drug target for therapeutic intervention against hyper lipid emi a and  atherosclerosis, and several clinical trials have tested the effects of ACAT inhibitors on the progression  of atherosclerosis. However, whether  ACAT-1  inhibition will serve as an effective drug target for  controlling atherosclerosis is under debate. Therefore, the genetic evidences for an association between  the  ACAT-1  gene and atherosclerosis in humans still needs to been clarified.  

The associations between  ACAT-1  gene polymorphisms and serum lipid levels were reported   in several studies. Takao  et al . [26] identified a missense variant (R526G) and a variant in the    $5^{\prime}$   untranslated region (77G-A) in  ACAT-1 , and no significant association was detected between both  SNPs and hyper lipid emi a. However, plasma concentrations of HDL-C and ApoAI in subjects with the  77G-A variant were significantly higher than in hyper lipid emi c subjects without the variant. In a  previous study, we also showed that rs1044925 was associated with increased serum HDL-C only in  hyper lipid emi c subjects [24]. These data suggest that the  ACAT-1  variants may be associated with  reduced ACAT-1 protein expression and influence cellular cholesterol efflux on hyper lipid emi a,  thereby playing an important role in atherosclerosis progression. In the general populations, the  rs1044925 C allele is also associated with protective serum lipid profiles. In the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao  population, serum lipid levels were obviously lower than those in Han Chinese. The female subjects  with an AC/CC genotype had lower serum TC, LDL-C and ApoB than those with a common AA  genotype [27]. Similar findings were also found in the healthy controls. Li  et al . [28] showed that  serum LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels were lower in the C allele carriers than in the C allele  non carriers. In the present study, we found that the C allele of rs1044925 was associated with a higher  serum HDL-C level in healthy controls. Thus, we infer that rs1044925 is associated with a risk of CAD  and IS. To our knowledge, the association between rs1044925 and the risk of atherosclerosis has not  been reported.  

In the present study, we showed that the frequencies of the AC/CC genotypes and C allele were  associated with a decreased risk of CAD and IS. Multivariate analysis showed that known risk factors,  such as BMI, diabetes, hypertension and hyper lipid emi a, were independently associated with CAD and  IS. Additionally, the rs1044925 AC/CC genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of CAD and  IS after adjusting for potential confounding factors. In the stratified analysis, a decreased risk of   CAD and IS in the subjects with an AC/CC genotype was mainly observed in males, nondrinkers and  those with a   $\mathrm{BMI}\ge24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  . A decreased risk of CAD in the subjects with an AC/CC genotype   was also observed in nonsmokers. Foam cell formation is a well-established hallmark of early-stage  atherosclerosis. The accumulation of CEs as abundant cytoplasmic lipid droplets, catalyzed by   ACAT-1, causes macrophages to be foamy in appearance. A close connection between the foam cell  appearance and ACAT-1 protein expression has been demonstrated in macrophages present in human  at hero sclerotic lesions [29]. Therefore, the possible mechanism by which  ACAT-1  gene variants  protect against atherosclerosis is that inhibiting  ACAT-1  may directly or indirectly diminish foamy  macrophage formation, thus further reducing the incidence of atherosclerosis. However, this protective  effect against atherosclerosis depends on the cellular cholesterol efflux ability in reverse cholesterol  transport, by which HDL is able to extract excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transfer   this cholesterol to the liver for biliary excretion. In a series of studies using macrophages from   ACAT-1 -knockout mice, because of the impaired of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, the complete  deletion of macrophage  ACAT-1  may lead to free cholesterol accumulation and subsequent  cyto toxicity to macrophages, thereby, exacerbating at hero sclerotic lesions [20–23]. In the present  study, C allele carriers had an increased serum HDL-C level, suggesting that cholesterol efflux was   not impaired when ACAT-1 activity was partially attenuated. A recent study [30] indicated that a  selective  ACAT-1  inhibitor, K-604, may not induce free cholesterol accumulation but may accelerate  cholesterol efflux from macrophages in an ApoE-independent manner, which can support the  conclusion that the C allele of rs1044925 is associated with a decreased risk of CAD and IS. However,  there were conflicting results between the  ACAT-1  deletion model and the present study. To explain  these discrepancies, we must understand that the  ACAT-1 -deletion mice show a complete absence of  ACAT-1 enzyme, a condition that does not occur in p harm a co logic interventions on  ACAT-1  in  animals or in human patients. Due to the complete absence of the ACAT-1 enzyme, the abundant  accumulation of free cholesterol may be beyond the ability of intrinsic intracellular cholesterol   efflux. Therefore, the mouse knockout model may be the most appropriate for demonstrating the   detrimental effects of drug overdoses in animals or in humans. Partial inhibition of  ACAT-1  reduced  atherosclerosis, effectively suggesting that  ACAT-1  inhibitors prevent atherosclerosis in a   dose-dependent manner. In three clinical trials in humans, non selective inhibition of ACAT had no  protective role on at hero sclerotic lesions but may actually promote atherosclerosis [14–16]. However,  the dose of ACAT inhibitor in these clinical trials was derived from the results of animal experiments  or  in vitro , the lipid metabolism and lesion biology differ from those in humans. The negative results  may be ascribed to inappropriate dosing. Therefore, new agents with moderate inhibition of  ACAT-1   need to be developed and studied in new clinical trials.  

As multi factorial diseases, both CAD and IS shared common risk factors, such as hypertension,  diabetes, dys lipid emi a and metabolic syndrome [31], and the common path oph y sio logic mechanisms   is atherosclerosis [32]. Atherosclerosis is an extremely complex disease process with a number of  important cellular contributors, including endo the li al cells, smooth muscle cells, and immune cells  (monocyte and T cells) [33–35]. Traditional risk factors lead to atherosclerosis by disrupting the  function of these cells [35,36]. There have been many hypotheses proposed to explain the underlying  mechanisms of the initiation, progression and rupture of at hero sclerotic plaque. The key points of these  hypotheses include the following: (i) lipoprotein retention; (ii) endo the li al dysfunction; (iii) immune  and inflammation response of the artery; (iv) vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation;   (v) lipid absorption by macrophages and VSMCs and the formation of foam cells; and (vi) platelet  activation and thrombosis [37,38]. Various epidemiological studies in families and twins have revealed  a genetic component to CAD and IS risk in humans, the gene variants involved in these pathways of  atherosclerosis could contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. From over 1300 publications of genetic  studies, the CAD gene database [37] includes information on more than 300 candidate genes for CAD.  While a single gene or gene region only explains a small part of the cardiovascular disease risk,   more large association studies, including more target genes, are needed to assess the risk of  cardiovascular disease.  

There are two potential limitations to the present study. First, a number of patients with CAD and IS  take anti-at hero sclerotic drugs, such as statins, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and aspirin, before being  enrolled in the study, whereas the controls did not take any drugs. The levels of TC and LDL-C were  also lower in the patients with IS and CAD than in the healthy controls. However, the drug information  was missing for some IS and CAD patients. Thus, when we detected the associations between the  genotypes and serum lipid levels in IS and CAD patients, interference by drug therapy could not be  analyzed. Second, although we found that the rs1044925 C allele was associated with a decreased risk  of CAD and IS, we did not detect an association between the rs1044925 C allele and the ACAT  enzyme activity, which is important for a functional evaluation of this SNP.  

# 4. Materials and Methods  

# 4.1. Cases and Controls  

A total of 587 patients with CAD and 555 patients with IS were recruited from hospitalized patients  in the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University. All of the enrolled CAD patients   were evaluated by coronary angiography due to suspected CAD or unrelated conditions requiring  ang io graphic evaluation; the coronary angiograms were analyzed by two experienced interventional  cardiologists. CAD was defined as significant coronary stenosis   $(\stackrel{>}{\geq}50\%)$   in at least one of the   three main coronary arteries or their major branches (branch diameter   $\geq\,2\,\mathrm{\mm}$  ). Subjects with  congenital heart disease and type I diabetes mellitus were excluded. All of the enrolled IS patients  received a strict neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis of IS  was according to the International Classification of Diseases (9th Revision). Patients with a transient  ischemic attack, embolic brain infarction, stroke caused by inflammatory disease, card i oem boli c  stroke, autoimmune disease, or serious chronic diseases were excluded from this study. Subjects with a  past history of CAD were also excluded from the study [39].  

A total of 588 healthy controls matched by age, gender, and geographical area were included.   The controls were judged to be free of CAD and IS by questionnaires, medical history, and clinical  examination. All individuals enrolled were from the Han population in Guangxi, China. A standard  questionnaire was used to ascertain general information and medical history from all participants. The  study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi  Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects after receiving a full explanation  of the study.  

# 4.2. Genotyping and Biochemical Analysis  

All of the biochemical assays and genotyping in CAD and IS patients were performed after  hospitalization, and all of the venous blood samples were obtained from the patients and controls   after at least   $12\textrm{h}$   of fasting. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using   the phenol-chloroform method [24,27]. Genotyping of rs1044925 was performed by polymerase   chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). PCR amplification was  performed using 5'-TAT AT TAAG GG GAT C AGA AGT-3' and   $5^{\prime}$  -CCA C CTA AAAA CAT ACT ACC-3'  as the forward and reverse primer pairs respectively. Each   $20~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   PCR reaction mixture consisted of    $1~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of genomic DNA,   $0.5~\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of each primer (10 pmol/L),   $10~\ensuremath{\,\upmu\mathrm{L}}$   of   $2\times$   Taq PCR Mastermix  (constituent:   $20\,\mathrm{\mM}$   Tris-HCl,   $\mathrm{pH}\ 8.3$  ,   $100\,\mathrm{\mM}$   KCl, 3 mM   $\mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$  ,   $0.1\,\mathrm{~U~}$   Taq Polymerase  $\langle\upmu\mathrm{L}$  ,    $500~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  dNTP each; Tiangen, Beijing, China), and  $8~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  of  $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O}$  (DNase/RNase-free). After initial de naturi zing at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $5\;\mathrm{min}$  , the reaction mixture was subjected to 33 cycles of   $45\mathrm{~s~}$   de natura tion at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , 30 s annealing at   $53\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and extension   $50~\mathrm{s}$   at   $72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , followed by a final   $10~\mathrm{min}$   extension at    $72\ \mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . After electrophoresis on a   $1.5\%$   agarose gel with   $0.5\ \ \upmu\mathrm{g/mL}$   ethidium bromide, the  amplification products were visualized under ultraviolet light. Then   $5\mathrm{~U~}$   of RsaI restriction enzyme  was added directly to the PCR products   $(5~\,\upmu\mathrm{L})$   and digested at   $37\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   overnight. After restriction  enzyme digestion of the amplified DNA, genotypes were identified by electrophoresis on   $1.5\%$   agarose  gels and visualized with ethidium-bromide staining ultraviolet illumination. The genotypes were  scored by an experienced reader blinded to the epidemiological data and serum lipid levels. Six  samples (AA, AC and CC genotypes in two; respectively) detected by the PCR-RFLP were also  confirmed by direct sequencing. The PCR products were purified by low melting point gel  electrophoresis and phenol extraction, and then the DNA sequences were analyzed in Shanghai Sangon  Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. The levels of TC, TG,  HDL-C, and LDL-C in the samples were determined by enzymatic methods with commercially  available kits. Serum Apo AI and ApoB levels were detected by an immuno turbid i metric  immuno as say using a commercial kit [24,27].  

# 4.3. Diagnostic Criteria  

The normal values for serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoAI, ApoB and ApoAI to ApoB ratio at  our Clinical Science Experiment Center (Nanning, China) were 3.10–5.17, 0.56–1.70, 0.91–1.81, 

  $2.70{-}3.20\,\mathrm{\mmol/L},\ 1.00{-}1.78,\ 0.63{-}1.14\,\mathrm{\g/L}$  , and 1.00–2.50 respectively. Individuals with   $\mathrm{TC}>$    

  $5.17\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$   and/or   $\mathrm{TG}>1.70\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$   were defined as hyper lipid emi c. Hypertension was diagnosed  according to the criteria from the 1999 World Health Organization-International Society of  Hypertension Guidelines for the management of hypertension. The diagnostic criteria for being  overweight and obesity were according to the Cooperative Meta-analysis Group of China Obesity Task  Force (Beijing, China). Normal weight, overweight and obesity were defined as a   ${\mathrm{BM}}<24\$  , 24–28,  and  $>28~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$   respectively [40]. Diabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose  $\geq7.0\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$   or 2  h post pr an dial plasma glucose   $\geq\!11.1\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$   or as having been previously diagnosed with diabetes  and receiving therapy [41].  

# 4.4. Statistical Analyses  

All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software package SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc.,  Chicago, IL, USA). A standard goodness-of-fit test was used to test the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  A chi-square analysis was used to evaluate the difference in genotype distribution and sex ratio  between the groups. The general characteristics between the cases and controls were tested using  Student’s unpaired  $t\cdot$  -test. The association between genotype and serum lipid parameters was tested by  analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Sex, age, BMI, blood pressure, alcohol consumption, and cigarette  smoking were adjusted for in the statistical analysis. ORs and   $95\%$   CIs were calculated using conditional  logistic regression. A two-tailed  $p$   value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.  

# 5. Conclusions  

The present study shows that the genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs1044925 were significantly  different between the patients with CAD or IS and controls. Subjects with CC genotype or C allele  were associated with a decreased risk of CAD in males, nondrinkers, nonsmokers and subjects with a   $\mathrm{BMI}\geq24\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$   and a decreased risk of IS in males, nondrinkers and subjects with a   $\mathrm{BMI}\geq24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  .  The AC/CC genotypes were also associated with increased serum HDL-C in the healthy controls.  These results suggest that the rs  $1044925\mathrm{~C~}$   allele was associated with increased serum HDL-C in the  healthy controls and with a decreased risk of CAD and IS.
