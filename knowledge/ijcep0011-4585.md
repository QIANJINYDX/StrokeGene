Abstract:  Previous genome-wide association studies have shown that the rs10248618 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the dynein axonemal heavy chain 11 gene ( DNAH11 ) has been associated with serum high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. However, little is known about such association in the Chinese population.  The present study was performed to clarify the association between the  DNAH11  rs10248618 SNP and serum lipid  traits and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS) in the Guangxi Han population. Genotypes of the  DNAH11  rs10248618 SNP in 1,213 unrelated patients (CAD, 600 and IS, 613) and 631 healthy controls were determined by snapshot technology. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the SNP were significantly  different between the CAD/IS patients and the controls   $\tt{P}<0.01$   for all). The CT/TT genotypes and the T allele were  associated with an increased risk of CAD and IS (CAD:   $P<0.01$   for CT/TT  vs . CC and T  vs . C; IS:    $P<0.01$   for CT/ TT  vs . CC and T  vs . C). The CT/TT genotypes in the healthy controls, but not in CAD or IS patients, were associated  with a decreased serum HDL-C and apo lipoprotein (Apo) A1 concentration. These results suggest that the  DNAH11   rs10248618 SNP is associated with the risk of CAD and IS in our study population. It is likely to increase the risk of  CAD and IS by reducing serum HDL-C and ApoA1 levels.

# Introduction  

At hero sclerotic cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemia  stroke (IS), two leading causes of mortality and  disability worldwide, produce colossal health  and economic burdens in the United States and  globally [1]. Atherosclerosis, characterized by  the damaging of arterial endo the li al cells and  the cumulative buildup of fatty deposits in the  sub-endo the li al layer [2], is a main underlying  pathology of CAD and IS. CAD may share some  common risk factors with IS. Behavioral/lifestyle patterns, elevated blood pressure, ad-verse a the rogen ic blood lipid levels, diabetes  mellitus, and tobacco use, are known to play a  role in the development of atherosclerosis  [3-9].  

Dys lipid emi a is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases [10]. Highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is  involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT),  which means that the cholesterol in the peripheral tissues is transported to the liver for excretion [11]. It is speculated that therapies which  would increase the flux of cholesterol from macrophages to HDL-C would reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. There is a strong  epidemiological relationship between HDL-C  and at hero sclerotic cardiovascular diseases.  The Tromsø Heart study is the first published  epidemiological study to provide prospective  evidence that the CAD risk is inversely related  to HDL-C independently of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), plasma triglyceride  (TG) and other CAD risk factors [12].  

Both CAD and IS are complex diseases, resulting from numerous additive and interacting  contributions in an individual’s environment  and lifestyle in combination with their underlying genetic architecture. Some studies have  confirmed that CAD and IS have a common  genetic architecture [13, 14]. We have currently  searched for the susceptibility genes in serum  lipid levels, CAD and IS with the positional candidate gene genotyping approach. One of the  chromosomal regions that we have focused on  in the present study is chromosome 7p, especially dynein axonemal heavy chain 11 (DNA-H11), because this chromosomal arm is associated with CAD [15]. However, it is unknown  whether those single nucleotide polymorph-isms (SNPs) associated with the risk of CAD are  also associated with the risk of IS.  

DNAH11  consists of 13,670 nucleotides and  contains a 13,569-nt ORF (GenBank accession  no AJ320497). The gene is composed of 82  exons, extending over 353 kb of genomic  sequence. However,  DNAH11  itself has been  implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)  [16, 17], an autosomal recessive disorder with  extensive genetic heterogeneity [18], which is  characterized by recurrent respiratory infections (bronchitis, rhino-sinusitis, and bronchi- ectasis). Half of PCD patients have situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome). Mutations in this  gene have also been implicated in male sterility  [19-21]. Recently, a SNP of rs10248618 in the  DNAH11  has been associated with modifications of serum HDL-C levels [22]. However, it is  unknown whether the SNP associated with the  HDL-C is also associated with the risk of CAD  and IS. Therefore, the purpose of the present  study was to detect the association between  the  DNAH11  rs10248618 SNP and serum lipid  traits and the risk of CAD and IS in the Chinese  Han population.  

# Materials and methods  

# Cases  

This study contained 1,213 unrelated patients  (CAD,  $n=600$   and IS,  $\ensuremath{n}=613,$  ). All of them were  hospitalized patients in the First Affiliated  Hospital, Guangxi Medical University. The CAD  group included patients with stable angina and  acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina,  non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and ST segment elevation myocardial  infarction). The diagnosis of CAD was based on  typical angina or discomfort, electro car diographic changes (ST-segment depression or  elevation of  $\geq0.5\ \mathsf{m m}$  , T-wave inversion of  $\geq3$    mm in  $\geq3$   leads, or left bundle branch block),  increases in the cardiac markers (creatinine  kinase-MB and troponin T or I), as well as positive coronary angiograms (coronary stenosis  $\geq$   $50\%$   in at least one of the three main coronary  arteries or their major branches which were  reviewed by two independent ang io graph ers  who were both blinded to the clinical and genotype results) [23]. All of the IS patients received  a strict neurological examination, and brain  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The diagnosis of IS was made according to TOAST (Trial of Org 10712 in Acute Stroke  Treatment) criteria, and the patients included  met one or two of these criteria: large artery  thrombosis and small-vessel occlusion [24]. All  patients with a history of autoimmune, hematologic, neoplastic, liver, renal, thyroid, and type 1  diabetes were rejected. CAD subjects with a  history of IS and IS patients with a history of  CAD were also excluded.  

Controls  

A total of 631 healthy controls matched by age,  gender, and geographical area were included.  The controls were judged to be free of CAD and  IS by questionnaires, medical history, and clinical examination. All individuals enrolled were  from the Han population in Guangxi, China. A  standard questionnaire was used to ascertain  general information and the medical histories  from all participants. The study protocol was  approved by the Ethics Committee of the First  Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University  (No. Lunshen 2009-Guike-018; Jan. 7, 2009).  Informed consent was obtained from all subjects after receiving a full explanation of the  study.  

Genotyping and biochemical analysis  

Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using  the phenol-chloroform method. The genotyping  of the  DNAH11  rs10248618 SNP was performed by the snapshot technology platform in  the Center for Human Genetics Research,  Shanghai Genesky Bio-Tech Co. Ltd., China. The  sense and antisense primers were 5’-CCGAC-CA ACT GT AT CCC A A GC-3’ and 5’-AGAATGCAGC-CACA GTC A A GC-3’, respectively. Before venous  blood samples were obtained, all participants  fasted at least   $\mathtt{12\ h}$  . The levels of total cholesterol (TC), TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C were deter

Diagnostic criteria  

The normal values in our Clinical Science  Experiment Center were   $3.10{\cdot}5.17\ \mathsf{m m o l}/\mathsf{L}$   for  TC, 0.56-1.70 mmol/L for TG, 0.91-1.81 mmol/L  for HDL-C,   $2.70{\cdot}3.20\ \mathsf{m m o l}/\mathsf{L}$   for LDL-C, 1.00-  $\pm.78\,\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{L}$   for ApoA1,  $0.63–1.14\,\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{L}$   for ApoB levels, and 1.00-2.50 for the ApoA1/ApoB ratio.  The participants with   $\mathsf{T C}>5.17\ \mathsf{m m o l/L}$  , and/  or  $\mathsf{T G}>\mathsf{L}.70\ \mathsf{m m o l/L}$   were defined as hyperlipidemic [25, 26]. Hypertension was defined as a  systolic blood pressure (SBP) of   $140\ \mathsf{m m H g}$   or  greater, and/or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP)  of 90 mmHg or higher [27]. Drinking was based  on alcohol consumption (yes or no). The indi- viduals’ ages were divided into   $<~60-$   or   $\geq$  60-year subgroups. Body mass index (BMI) was  calculated according to the values of weight  divided by height squared   $({\mathsf{k g}}/{\mathsf{m}}^{2})$  ). A BMI of   $<$  24, 24-28, and  $>28\;\mathsf{k g}/\mathsf{m}^{2}$   was defined as normal weight, overweight and obesity, respectively. Smoking was defined as current smoking  (yes or no).  

Statistical analyses  

The statistical analyses were performed using  the statistical software package SPSS 21.0  (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Quantitative variables were expressed as the mean  $\pm$  standard  deviation (serum TG levels were presented as  medians and interquartile ranges). Qualitative  variables were expressed as percentages. The  Handy-Weinberg equilibrium was determined  using the standard goodness-of-fit test. A chisquare analysis was used to evaluate the differ

ence in genotype distribution between the  groups. The general characteristics between  the patient and control groups were tested by  the Student’s unpaired  t -test. The association  of genotypes and serum lipid parameters in the  control group was tested by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). An unconditional logistic  regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between the risk of CHD and IS and the  genotypes. Age, gender, BMI, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption were adjusted for  the statistical analysis. The odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence interval   $(95\%$   CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression  analysis. Results were considered to be statistically significant if bilateral   $P_{\cdot}$  -values were less  than 0.05.  

# Results  

# General characteristics and serum lipid levels  

The baseline characteristics of the patients  with CAD or IS and the controls are shown in  Table 1 . The mean age, male to female ratio,  serum LDL-C and ApoB levels were not significantly different between the controls and CAD  patients and between the controls and IS  patients   ${P>0.05}$   for all). The values of height,  weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure, pulse  pressure, serum TG; the percentages of subjects who smoked cigarettes; and the prevalence of hypertension and hyper lipid emi a were  higher in both CAD and IS than in the control  groups (  $\tt{P}<0.01$   for all), but the levels of serum  TC, HDL-C, ApoA1; the ratio of ApoA1 to ApoB;  and the percentages of subjects who consumed alcohol were lower in both the CAD and  IS patients than in control groups   $\bar{P}<0.00\bar{\perp}$   for  all).  

# Genotypic and allelic frequencies  

The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the   DNAH11  rs10248618 SNP are presented in  Table 2 . The genotype distribution of the SNP  was concordant with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both cases (  $\bar{P}=0.154$   for CAD and  $P$     $=0.082$   for IS) and controls   $(P=0.135)$  ). The  frequency of the C and   $\intercal$   alleles was   $77.65\%$    and   $22.35\%$   in the controls,   $71.08\%$   and   $28.92\%$   in the CAD patients   $\tt{(P<0.01}$   for CAD  vs . control), and   $72.43\%$   and   $27.57\%$   in the IS  patients   ${P}<0.01$   for IS  vs . control); respectively. The frequencies of the CC, CT and TT genotypes were   $59.27\%$  ,   $36.77\%$   and   $3.96\%$   in the  controls;   $49.33\%$  ,   $43.50\%$   and   $7.17\%$   in CAD  patients   $\tt{P\mathrm{~<~}0.01}$   for CAD  vs . control); and 

  $51.06\%$  ,   $42.74\%$   and   $6.20\%$   in the IS patients 

  $\tt{P}<0.01$   for IS  vs . control); respectively.

There was an increased  risk of IS in subjects with CT/TT genotypes,  mainly in those who belonged to one of the following groups: old age   $(\mathsf{O R}=1.423$  ,   $95\%$   ${\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{I}}\ =$

# Discussion  

DNAH11 , known to be involved in the movements of cellular cilia, has been implicated in  CAD. Our previous study confirmed that the  DNAH11  rs12670798 SNP is associated with  CAD and IS in the Chinese population [28]. In  the present study, we also showed that the  genotypic and allelic frequencies of the  DNAH11   rs10248618 SNP were different between the  CAD/IS patients and healthy controls. The frequency of the   $\intercal$   allele was higher in the CAD   $(28.92\%)$   and IS   $(27.57\%)$   patients than in the  controls   $(22.35\%$  ,   $P<0.01$   for each). The fre- quency of the TT genotype was also higher in  CAD   $7.17\%$  ,  $P<0.01$  ) and IS   $(6.20\%$  ,  $P<0.01,$  )  patients than in the controls   $(3.96\%)$  . The CT/ TT genotypes and the T allele were associated  with an increased risk of CAD and IS. To the  best of our knowledge, this is the first report to  demonstrate that the  DNAH11  rs10248618  SNP is significantly associated with the risk of  CAD and IS in the Chinese Han population.  

These findings suggest that the  DNAH11  rs-10248618 SNP may be a susceptibility locus  for CAD and IS in our study populations.  

The minor allele frequency (MAF) of the  DNA-H11  rs10248618 SNP was different in diverse  racial/ethnic groups. The data in the Inter-national HapMap Project’s database suggests  that the frequency of the rs10248618 T allele  was   $5\%$   in the Europeans,   $22.22\%$   in the Han  Chinese in Beijing,   $22.72\%$   in the Japanese,  and   $36.81\%$   in Sub-Saharan Africans. In the  present study, we showed that the MAF of the T  allele was  $28.92\%$   in CAD,  $27.57\%$   in IS patients  and   $22.35\%$   in controls. As compared with the  other populations, we found that the frequency  of the rs10248618 T allele in our study populations was almost consistent with those of the  International HapMap Chinese Han Beijing  samples. These findings suggest that the prevalence of the  DNAH11  rs12670798 SNP might  have a racial/ethnic specificity.  

Cholesterol deposition is the main cause of athero sclerotic cardiovascular disease, and this  lipid hypothesis can be traced back to Ani-tschkow’s rabbit studies of about 100 years  ago [29]. The epidemiological studies indicate  a very strong and independent inverse association of HDL-C with atherosclerosis [12, 30-34].  It is estimated that a   $\tt{10\ m g/L}$   increase in  HDL-C is associated with a   $2–4\%$   lowering of  coronary death independent of LDL-C [35].  Although reverse cholesterol transport was first  postulated to be a major contributor to the flux  of cholesterol from macrophages to HDL-C that  would reduce at hero sclerotic cardiovascular  disease, many other specious contributions  have been disclosed. Elevated concentrations  of serum HDL-C contribute to protection against  cardiovascular disease through multiple mechanisms, including anti platelet, anti-inflamma-tory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, va so dilatory  activities and anti thr ombo tic properties, as  well as effects on glucose metabolism [36-43].  Recently, many studies have suggested that  HDL-C is a complex of many proteins and phospholipids, with different physiological and metabolic properties. These proteins are organized  into high-density lipoprotein subspecies, a lipoprotein granule system that has just been considered structural, functional, and diseaserelated [44-47].  

The potential association between the  DNAH11   rs10248618 SNP and serum lipid profiles in  humans has been evaluated in previous GW-AS. It has reported a significant association  between the  DNAH11  rs10248618 SNP and  HDL-C levels [22]. In the current study, we found  that serum HDL-C and ApoA1 levels in the control group were different among the genotypes  of the  DNAH11  rs10248618 SNP, as the subjects with CT/TT genotypes had lower HDL-C  and ApoA1 levels than those with the CC genotype. These results suggest that the  DNAH11   rs10248618 SNP may be a genetic marker  associated with dys lipid emi a in our study po-pulations.  

The interactions of the  DNAH11  rs10248618  SNP and some environmental factors on the  risk of CAD and IS are not known. In the present  study, stratified analyses according to gender,  age, BMI, smoking, drinking, and hypertension  showed that the  DNAH11  rs10248618 CT/TT  genotypes were associated with an increased  risk of CAD in patients with age  $\ge60$   years, BMI   $\geq24~\mathsf{k g}/\mathsf{m}^{2}$  , smokers, drinkers and hypertension subgroups, and higher risk of IS in age    $\ge60$   years, female, smokers and hypertens-ion subgroups than in the corresponding subgroups; respectively. These findings suggest  that the  DNAH11  rs10248618 SNP may interact with these parameters to influence the risk  of CAD and IS. But these interactions still need  to be assessed with larger sample sizes in the  other populations. Our findings may provide  new insights into the possible biological mechanisms associated with lipid metabolism and  the risk of CAD and IS.  

# Limitations  

Although the present study provided interesting  findings about the association of the  DNAH11   rs10248618 SNP and serum lipid phenotypes  and the risk of CAD or IS, several potential limitations should be acknowledged. First, compared to many GWAS and replication studies,  the sample size of our study was relatively  small. Therefore, further studies with larger  sample sizes are needed to confirm our resu-lts. Second, although we found that the rs-10248618 T allele was associated with an  increased risk of CAD and IS, we did not detect  an association between the rs10248618 T  allele and the NADH11 enzyme activity, which  is important for a functional evaluation of this  SNP. Third, our study examined the serum concentration of ApoA1, an indicator that reflects  the function of HDL-C, which was consistent  with HDL-C. However, our study did not detect  other parameters related to HDL-C function,  nor did it detect factors that affected HDL-C  function, such as HDL-C size, ApoCIII, blood   glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and  fibrinogen.  

# Conclusions  

The present study shows that the genotypic  and allelic frequencies of the  DNAH11  rs-10248618 SNP were significantly different  between the CAD or IS patients and the controls. The TT genotype and the T allele were  associated with an increased risk of CAD and  IS, especially in the subgroup of age  $\ge60$   years,  female (IS),   ${\mathsf{B M I}}\,\geq\,24~{\mathsf{k g}}/{\mathsf{m}}^{2}$   (CAD), smokers,  drinkers (CAD) and hypertension. The CT/TT  genotypes were also associated with a decr-eased serum concentration of HDL-C and  ApoA1 in the healthy controls. These results  suggest that the detection of  DNAH11  rs-10248618 SNP may have a potential role on  the genetic diagnosis of dys lipid emi a and athero sclerosis-related diseases such as CAD and  IS in the Chinese populations. However, larger  studies of populations with different ethnic   origins are required to confirm these obser-vations.
