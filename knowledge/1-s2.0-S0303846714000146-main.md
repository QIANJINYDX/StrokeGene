Objective: Although recent    evidence has    implicated that    5-lip oxygen as e activating protein (ALOX5AP) gene is associated with    ischemic stroke    (IS)    risk,    the    underlying molecular mechanism remains to be deﬁned. This    study    aimed    to    investigate the    role    of    ALOX5AP rs4073259 in    ischemic    stroke    in a    North- eastern Chinese Han    population.  

Methods: A    total    of 501 IS    patients and    497 healthy controls were    enrolled for    polymerase chain reaction

 (PCR) and    ligase    detection reaction    (LDR) analysis of ALOX5AP rs4073259 single    nucleotide polymorphism

 (SNP).  

Results: There    were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in ALOX5AP rs4073259 allele and    genotype frequencies between IS    or subtypes of IS    and    controls. There    was no    signiﬁcant difference in genotype and allele frequencies of    atherosclerosis degree    between    ischemic subjects with carotid artery plaque or absence. However, total    cholesterol (TC),    low-density lipoprotein (LDL),    and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in women patients    were sign i cant ly higher than those in    men     $\cdot_{\textstyle p=0.015}$  , 0.000, and 0.008,    respectively). Total    homo cyst eine (tHcy)    was    higher    in    men    patients than that    in    women  $\left(p\!=\!0.021\right)$  

Conclusion: There    was    no statistically signiﬁcant association of    ALOX5AP rs4073259    SNP with    ischemic stroke in this northeastern Chinese Han    population living    in    Heilongjiang province, China.

# 1. Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the leading causes of death and adult disability in the world [1,2] . Accumulating evidence has indicated that ischemic stroke is a complicated clinical syndrome with diverse etiologies, including genetic predisposition and environmental factors [3–5] . Recent studies have also shown that in amma tion plays an important role in pathogen es is of atherosclerosis, which is the major pathological basis of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular disease [6–11] . Leu kotri ene s (LTs) are the key components in in amma tory reactions and secreted by various types of in amma tory cells, which are also implicated in initiation and progression of atherosclerosis [6,12,13] . 5-lip oxygen as e activating protein (FLAP) and 5-lip oxygen as e pathway (5-LO) are the key factors involved in the leu kotri ene s production [14,15] . Following  $C a^{+}$  -dependent cell activation, arachidonic acid is released from the cell membrane phospholipids by cytosolic ph os ph o lipase  $\mathsf{A}_{2}$   for synthesis of 5-LO by FLAP [16] . During this process, ara chi donate is converted into a unstable intermediate LTA4 [17] and conjunction of LTA4 with glut at hi one by LTC4 synthase forms LTC4. LTC4 is then cleaved by gamma-glutamyl trans pep tid as e to LTD4, which is then metabolized by a dip ep tid as e to LTE4 [18,19] . The main pathophysi- ological effect of these cysteinyl-LTs includes leucocytes activation, monocyte diapedesis across the endo the li al barrier, and increasing permeability of blood vessels [20] .  

The role of FLAP and 5-LO in production of leu kotri ene s could be involved in pathogen es is of atherosclerosis. So it is reasonable and interesting to investigate the association of FLAP and 5-LO with IS. DeCODE genetic group ﬁrst showed a single ALOX5AP haplotype consisted of four single nucleotide acids, termed Hap A, could increase risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke by nearly two folds in the Iceland population [21] . The same research group also found another haplotype, i.e., Hap B, was closely associated with the incidence of myocardial infarction in individuals from United Kingdom [22] . In contrast, another study found that ALOX5AP polymorphism had no association with MRI-deﬁned brain infarcts [23] . However, there were only a few studies reporting the association of ALOX5AP rs4073259 with IS [24,25] . Thus, in this study we mainly focused on investigation of ALOX5AP rs4073259 association with IS risk in a northeastern Chinese Heilongjiang province Han population.  

# 2. Subjects and methods  

# 2.1. Subjects  

A total of 501 patients with unrelated IS of the northeastern Chinese Han population (331 males, 170 females) were included in this study. These patients have lived in Heilongjiang province for more than 20 years and were enrolled in this study from the Department of Neurology, The Second Hospital afﬁliated to Harbin Medical University (Harbin, Heilongjiang, China) between April 2011 and May 2012. All patients underwent the computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or both in the head within one week after hospital admission. Among these 501 patients, 210 patients underwent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) to evaluate severity of cerebral atherosclerosis. Eighty-seven patients received carotid duplex sonography and showed there were two groups of patients, i.e., Group A was without carotid artery atherosclerosis plaque and Group B was with carotid atherosclerosis plaque (e.g., hard plaque, combined plaques, and soft plaques). The patients undergone MRA or CTA were divided into two groups, i.e., Group C was with intracranial artery stenosis rate of  ${\le}50\%$  and Group D was with intra cranial artery stenosis rate of  ${\tt>}50\%$  . Trans thora cal echo car dio graph y was obtained in 150 patients.  

According to the criteria in the Trial of Org 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) class i cation [26] , these patients were further classiﬁed into ﬁve subgroups, i.e., large artery atherosclerosis,  $n\!=\!81$   $(16.2\%)$  ; lacunar stroke,  $n\!=\!310\,(61.9\%)$  large artery atherosclerosis and lacunar stroke (combination type),  $n\,{=}\,104\,(20.8\%)$  car dio geni c stroke,  $n\!=\!2\left(0.4\%\right)$  the etiology of stroke remained unclear despite of different diagnostic efforts,  $n\!=\!4\left(0.8\%\right)$  The subtype analysis was limited to large artery atherosclerosis, lacunar stroke, and combination type because of small sample sizes of other subtypes.  

Furthermore, we also recruited 497 healthy unrelated individuals as controls (300 males, 197 females) from Health Medical Center, The Second Hospital afﬁliated to the Harbin Medical University. All control subjects had no history of stroke, other central nervous system disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancer, endocrine diseases, infectious diseases, trauma, or surgery history. After neurological examination, there were no focal signs detected in these control subjects. Among them, approximate 80 subjects received brain CT scan and there were no positive disorders detected.  

A questionnaire was designed to collect detailed information about risk factors of stroke, including gender, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyper lipid emi a, coronary heart disease, stroke history, arterial brillat ion, smoking, and alcohol abusing for both cases and controls. This study was approved by the local ethics committee and each subject enrolled in this study was informed and consented.  

# 2.2. Genotyping  

Peripheral venous blood was withdrawn form each studied subject for genotyping of ALOX5AP rs4073259 polymorphism, which was performed by Shanghai BioWing Applied Biotechnology Company ( http://www.biowing.com.cn ) using a ligase detection reaction (LDR) [27] . The primers used to the target DNA sequence were  $5^{\prime}$  -CCA A AG GC TTC ACC TC TG AT $.3^{\prime}$  and  $5^{\prime}$  - CG GC A CAT GAA AAC AG CAC $.3^{\prime}$  . In brief, genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood using a standard protocol [28] and these DNA samples were ampliﬁed by PCR in a  $20\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  reaction mixture, which contained  $1\times\ \mathsf{P C R}$  buffer,  $0.6\,\upmu\mathrm{l\Mg^{++}}$     $(3.0\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L})$   $50\,\mathrm{ng}$  of genomic DNA,  $0.4\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  each primer,  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  de oxy nucleotide triphosphate s  $(2.0\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L})$   $0.3\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  of 1U Qiagen HotStarTaq Polymerase (Qiagen, Germany) and  $4\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  of  $1\times\;Q\cdot$  Q-solution. The LDR was performed in a  $10\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  reaction mixture containing  $1\times$  buffer,  $12.5\,\mathrm{pmmol}/\upmu\mathrm{l}$  of each probe mix,  $0.05\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  of 2U Taq DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and  ${\geq}1\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$  of  $100\,\mathrm{ng}/\upmu\mathrm{l}$  multiPCR product. Quality of the genotyping was evaluated by testing blind blood duplicates (49).  

# 2.3. Statistics analysis  

Allele and genotype frequencies were calculated for each locus and the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was performed using the  $\chi^{2}$  testwithSPSS20.0forwindowssoftware(SPSS,Chicago,IL,USA).The association between phenotype and genotype was analyzed by the  $\chi^{2}$    test. Logistic regression was used to adjust the bias of classic stroke risk factors, such as age, BMI, blood pressure, plasma glucose level, lipid proﬁle, cigarette smoking, and alcohol intake. A  $p$  -value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. Characteristics of subjects  

The clinical characteristics for the 501 IS patients and 497 healthy control subjects used in this study are shown in Table 1 . Particularly, there were signiﬁcant differences observed between the IS and control group for age, BMI, SBP, DBP, hypertension, DM, lipids, smoking, and alcohol consumption.  

# 3.2. Genotype and allele frequencies  

The characteristics of allele frequency and genotype frequency were determined for rs4073259 in ALOX5AP promoter region and the results was summarized in Table 2 . In brief, the A allele was shown at a frequency of  $53.6\%$  in cases vs.  $54.7\%$  in controls. The G allele was found at a frequency of  $46.4\%$  in cases vs.  $45.3\%$  in controls. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls. Using logistics regression analysis to adjust the bias of conventional stroke risk factors, there was also no association between the case and control (  $\begin{array}{r}{{\displaystyle{\dot{p}}\!=\!0.834}}\end{array}$  and 0.999, respectively). The allele and geno- type frequencies of ALOX5AP rs4073259 did not sign i cant ly differ between the case and control using Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium analysis  $\mathbf{\dot{}}p\,{=}\,0.2377$  

# 3.3. Subtype analysis of IS  

The subtype analysis of IS was performed using the groups of large artery atherosclerosis, lacunar stroke and combination type. A summary of the characteristics of allele frequency and genotype

frequency in subtypes of IS are shown in Table 3 . In particular, the A allele was found at a frequency of  $53.7\%$  in large artery atherosclerosis,  $54.0\%$  in lacunar stroke, and  $52.4\%$  in combination type. The G allele was found at a frequency of  $46.3\%$  in large artery atherosclerosis,  $46.0\%$  in lacunar stroke, and  $48.6\%$  in combination type. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in genotype and allele frequencies among these IS subtypes.  

# 3.4. Association of stroke patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis plaque  

We also evaluated the association of ALOX5AP rs4073259 SNP with existence of carotid artery atherosclerosis plaque in ischemic subjects ( Table 4 ). No signiﬁcant associations were observed for the genotype and allele frequencies between ischemic subjects with carotid artery atherosclerosis plaque  $\cdot_{p\,=\,0.971}$  and 0.793, respectively).

Group C patients had  ${\le}50\%$  of an intra cranial artery stenosis rate, whereas Group D patients had more than  $50\%$  of an intra cranial artery stenosis rate.  

# 3.5. Association of stroke patients with different severity of atherosclerosis  

MRA or CTA were utilized as a tool to evaluate severity of cerebral atherosclerosis. Based on the established grading system, we divided 210 IS patients who underwent MRA or CTA into two subgroups, i.e., Group C patients had  ${\le}50\%$  of an intra cranial artery stenosis rate, whereas Group D patients had  ${\tt>}50\%$  of an intracranial artery stenosis rate. The frequencies of ALOX5AP G/A genotype or allele of rs4073259 had not difference between these two groups of patients  $\dot{\,p}\!=\!0.911$  and 0.986, respectively; Table 5 ).  

# 3.6. Association of genotype and lipid proﬁle of patients  

We then associated ALOX5AP genotypes with lipid proﬁles of these 501 ischemic stroke patients and analyzed the lipid proﬁles between male and female patients. The lipid proﬁles of the patients were classiﬁed as low, normal, and high according to the previously deﬁned normal range  $\mathrm{?TC,3.8-5.17\,mmol/L}$  TG,  $0.56{-}1.70\,\mathrm{mmol/L}$  LDL, 0.45–3.15 mmol/L; HDL, 1.04–1.70 mmol/L; ApoA,  $1.0{-}1.6\,\mathrm{g/L}$

However, TC, LDL, HDL and tHcy were different between male and female patients, i.e., TC, LDL and HDL were sign i cant ly higher in female patients than in male patients  $\dot{p}\!=\!0.015$  0.000, and 0.008, relatively), while tHcy was higher in male patients than that in female patients  $\cdot_{p}\!=\!0.021$  Table 6 ).  

# 4. Discussion  

In this study, we investigated the association between ALOX5AP rs4073259 polymorphism and IS susceptibility. However, we did not ﬁnd a statistical difference in gender distribution between the case and the control, although the proportion of male patients in the case group  $(60.4\%)$  is higher than that of women patients  $(39.6\%)$  . The median age, body mass index (BMI), blood lipids, glu- cose, and blood pressure levels, tobacco, and alcohol consumption were higher than those in the controls, which is consistent with the epidemiological ﬁndings. A previous study demonstrated that many factors were contributed to IS and intra cerebral haemorrhagic stroke; for example, history of hypertension, current smoker, waist-to-hip ratio, diet risk score, physical activity, diabetes mellitus, alcohol intake, psychosocial stress and depression, cardiac alteration, and ratio of apo lipoprotein s B to A1 [4] . Furthermore, there was no statistical association of ALOX5AP allele and genotype frequencies between case or IS subtype and controls after a multivariate logistic regression analysis. After adjusting the bias of classical stroke risk factors, the results revealed that  ${\mathsf{G}}/{\mathsf{A}}$  genotype of ALOX5AP rs4073259 did not contribute to IS risk. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in ALOX5AP genotype and allele frequencies between the IS subtype and controls.  

However, two previous studies of different ethnic patients showed that ALOX5AP rs4073259 was associated with risk of IS [24,25] , i.e., Lohmussaar et al. [24] showed that there was a stronger association of ALOX5AP rs4073259 between IS in male patients than that in female patients in Iceland population (odds ratio, 1.26;  $95\%$  CI 1.03–1.54;  $p\!=\!0.024$  Zhang et al. [25] analyzed ALOX5AP polymorphism in 236 patients with a history of cerebral infarction and 219 healthy subjects without a history of cerebral infarction or cardio vascular disease and family history of cerebro vascular diseases for three generations, which included individuals in the Han population whose families have lived in the Northeastern part of China, including Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning, for more than three generations. They found that ALOX5AP rs4073259 A allele was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, whereas ALOX5AP rs4073259 GG was associated with a decreased risk. In addition, Ji et al. [29] showed that ALOX5AP promoter region-581 582 Ins A, an insertion and deletion polymorphism, was a novel genetic variant for ischemic stroke risk. Furthermore, a haplotype-based analysis for ALOX5AP haplotype AA of block 2 involving rs10507391 and rs12429692, and rs9579646 AG genotype was associated with a decreased risk of stroke in Eastern Chinese Han population [30] . However, in this study, we    did not ﬁnd any association of ALOX5AP rs4073259 between the case and control. We also did not observe the association of A allele with the increased risk of ischemic stroke in the Han population, which lived in Heilongjiang province more than 20 years. Our data failed to replicate all of these previous ﬁndings. The underlying reason is unknown, but might be due to different populations, sampling strategies, or phenotype heterogeneity. Another possibility is that etiologies of stroke in this study and previous studies might have been different. For example, in this study, IS patients with lacunar infarction had highest proportion  $(61.9\%)$  , while IS incidence with unknown etiologies was lowest

  $(0.8\%)$  . The latter was much lower than that reported in the literature [31] , but it was consistent with another Chinese study reported by Wu et al. [32] . However, the discrepancy of the rates between Chinese and other ethnic population remains unknown, which may lead to a future collaborative study on this. Furthermore, although 80 subjects of our healthy controls without cerebro vascular diseases who underwent brain CT scan did not show any positive ﬁndings, we could not ensure that brain CT scan without positive ﬁnding in all of these healthy controls, thus, silent strokes cannot be ruled out. We    speculate that environmental factors may contribute to expression and activity of ALOX5AP. Heilongjiang is localized at a high latitude area where residents grow accustom to high salt and fat diets, which are risk factors for hypertension and promote a lacunar stroke. In addition, detection of a single gene polymorphism could only associate with a modest effect, but multiple SNPs in multiple genes plus a haplotype analysis may have more powerful to associate with IS risk.  

Furthermore, this study further explored the association of carotid plaques and degree of cerebral atherosclerosis with ALOX5AP rs4073259 polymorphism. We    found that the  ${\mathsf{G}}/{\mathsf{A}}$  genotype of rs4073259 was not a risk factor in developing atherosclerosis in ischemic subjects. Jin et al. [33] showed that frequency of SG13S114 AA genotype and A allele was sign i cant ly higher in a the roth rom bot ic cerebral infarction patients with vulnerable plaques than those with stable plaques; thus, and they deduced that A allele may be a risk factor of vulnerable plaques. However, in this study, we did not ﬁnd that ALOX5AP rs4073259 associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis plaque. Based on the small number of patients who underwent to carotid ultrasound examination and cerebral angiography, we cannot rule out contribution of ALOX5AP rs4073259 to atherosclerosis in ischemic stroke patients.  

It has been reported that various gene polymorphisms affect lipids and tHcy proﬁle, although a previous study by Shin et al. [34] showed that there was no association between PON gene polymorphisms and stroke, but PON1-55 L allele elevated the plasma concentration of total homo cyst eine, PON2-148A and 311 S alleles were associated with higher plasma total and LDL cholesterol, and ApoB, PON2-148G elevated plasma concentration of total and HDL cholesterol and ApoA1. Another study showed that that the HindIII polymorphism of LPL was associated with ischemic stroke and elevated levels of plasma triglycerides and reduced HDL levels. This gene polymorphism was associated with intra cranial large artery atherosclerosis that is the most frequent subtype in Andhra Pradesh [35] . However, to date, there is no study reported the association between ALOX5AP polymorphism and lipids and tHcy proﬁle. In our study, there was no association of ALOX5AP genotypes with lipid proﬁles or total homo cyst eine levels. But levels of TC, LDL, HDL, and tHcy were obviously different in men and women, indicating that their levels were inﬂuenced by sex, life-style, and other factors. As reported previously, many factors sign i cant ly increased risk of hyper homo cy steinem i a, such as increased age, male sex, family history of stroke, in addition to de cie nci es of serum folate and vitamin B12, and elevated serum creatinine [36] . So we speculated that ALOX5AP polymorphisms may contribute little to lipids proﬁle and tHcy level relative to environmental factors in ischemic stroke patients in our region.  

Ischemic stroke is a complex clinical syndrome with different etiologies and risk factors. Our current data demonstrated that ALOX5AP rs4073259 was not associated with ischemic stroke risk in the northeastern Chinese Han population although TC, LDL, HDL, and tHcy were obviously different in men and women. Undoubtedly, further studies of different ethnic populations with a larger sample size and brain CT or MRI scan in all the subjects will provide insightful information regarding this SNP for association with IS risk.
