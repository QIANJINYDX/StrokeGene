# Abstract  

Despite strong genetic implications of NLRP3 in fl amma some, its examination as genetic determinant of ischaemic stroke (IS) remains to be done in Punjab, which has been investigated in this study. In this case control study, 400 subjects (200 IS patients, 200 stroke free controls) were included. Contributions of 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including a functional SNP within NLRP3 gene (rs10754558, rs4612666, rs2027432, rs3738488 and rs1539019) for the risk of IS were investigated through genetic models after correcting the effect of significant variables. Plasma levels of three pro-inflammatory markers, that is, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1beta   $(\mathsf{I L}_{}{-}\boldsymbol{1}\beta)$   and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were measured by enzyme-linked immuno s or bent assays (ELISA). Minor alleles of 3 out of 5 SNPs (rs10754558, rs4612666 and rs1539019) exhibited association with IS risk in additive, recessive and multiplicative models. Multivariable regression analysis confirmed that higher levels  $p=.003),1\mathsf{L}\!-\!1\beta\left(\beta\pm\mathsf{S E};1.78\pm0.88,p=.043\right)$   =  ±  ±  $1.42\pm0.57$   =  .043) and IL-18 (  $p=.013)$   $;(\beta\pm{\sf S E};1.13\pm0.49,p=.021)$   ±  $(\beta\pm S E$   ±  $1.22\pm0.41$  were independent risk predictors for IS. Haplotype analysis revealed a susceptibility putative haplotype GTGTA, which approximately doubled the IS risk (OR: 1.98, 95% CI:  $1.12\substack{-3.78,p=.04})$  ) in dominant mode after adjusting the effect with confounding variables. This susceptibility putative haplotype GTGTA was significantly associated with increased concentrations of CRP   $(\beta=1.21\$  ,  $p=.014.$  ) and   $|\mathsf{L}|\!\cdot\!1\beta\,(\beta=1.53,\,p=.034)$  in dose-dependent manner (less in carriers of 1 copy than those who had 2 copies of GTGTA).  

The present study has revealed a susceptibility putative haplotype GTGTA within NLRP3 gene, carriers of which have double the risk of IS by having increased plasma levels of CRP and IL $1\beta$   in a dose-dependent manner.

# 1 INTRODUCTION  

Ischaemic stroke (IS) is a multi factorial condition, which is manifested as a medical emergency with focal neurological dysfunction, lasting more than   $24\ \mathsf{h}$   and confirmed by focal infarction (Hankey,  2017 ). It accounts for more than  $87\%$   of all strokes (Donkor,  2018 ). Being the third largest cause of death worldwide in the elderly population, ischaemic stroke poses a huge threat to human population (GBD 2019 Stroke Collaborators,  2021 ). Almost six million people die every year succumbing to the dreadful ness of IS, which is largely contributed by developing countries. In India, it is highly impinging on health statistics as early onset of age, higher case fatality rate, substantial disability adjusted life years (DALY) loss and alarming post-stroke ramifications are highly rampant (Pandian & Sudhan,  2013 ).  

In the clinical chapters of stroke path o physiology, atherosclerosis is the primary culprit and vascular inflammation triggers and perpetuates it (Ahmad et al.,  2014 ; Iadecola & Anrather,  2011 ). The inflammatory trigger by lipid rich foam cells in atherosclerosis is already known (Libby et al.,  2002 ). It has been observed that the micro cholesterol crystals present in at hero sclerotic lesions induce danger signals, which are actually the foremost signals of inflammation (Duewell et al.,  2010 ). These very early signals are sensed by a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) named Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) in fl amma some. It is a multi protein complex which activates and initiates robust inflammatory response towards arterial occlusion and contributes to the advancement of cerebral ischaemia (Gao et al., 2017 ; Glass et al.,  2010 ). In the process of in fl amma some activation, NLRP3 senses several a the rogen ic stimuli and recruits adapter proteins; apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a card (ASC) and caspase-1 leading to maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines; interleukin 1-beta (IL-1 β ) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Gao et al., ). Present abundantly in atheromatous lesions, both IL $1\beta$  and IL-18 help in plaque development and its propagation to ischaemic stroke (Mallat et al.,  2001 ; Varghese et al.,  2016 ). Therefore, efforts to repress in fl amma some by antagonists and inhibitors has been seen to improve neuronal health, reduction in infarct size, suppressing neuroinflammation and oedema in stroke (Glass et al.,  2010 ; Ishrat et al., 2015 ; Zhu et al.,  2021 ).  

Studies have confirmed that NLRP3 in fl amma some activation is genetically controlled (Hitomi et al.,  2009 ; Tong et al.,  2015 ). Present on  $1{\mathfrak{q}}44$   position, NLRP3 gene contains 9 exons, around 60 SNPs and encodes a protein called cryopyrin. Mainly present in ch on dr o cyte s and leukocytes, this immune regulatory protein responds to toxins, pyrogens and cellular injury because of its extra-sensitive sensing potential of very early incidents of inflammation and degeneration (Lamkanfi  $\&$  Dixit,  2009 ). The sooner it senses cellular debris, the sooner it gets activated and starts secreting IL $1\beta$   and IL-18. These pro-inflammatory cytokines initiate, augment and stabilize vascular inflammation leading to ischaemia (Zhu et al.,  2016 ). It has been confirmed that minor allele (G) of rs10754558 SNP enhances 1.3-fold higher NLRP3 mRNA expression and its stability (Hitomi et al.,  2009 ). This allele of functional SNPhas been observed to be associated with higher risk of ischaemic stroke in Swedish and Chinese populations (Cheng et al., 2018 ; Kastbom et al.,  2015 ; Lv et al.,  2020 ; Zhu et al.,  2016 ).  

Despite such a strong genetic association, the participation and contribution of those genetic variants that trigger and activate NLPR3 in fl amma some in ischaemic stroke patients have not been investigated in India so far. Therefore, the objective of the study is to investigate the genetic contribution of SNPs within NLRP3 gene and their relationship with pro-inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), IL $_{1\beta}$  and IL-18 for the risk of IS in the population of Punjab, India.  

# 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# 2.1 Study population  

Present prospective case-control study comprises 200 ischaemic stroke patients and 200 stroke free control subjects of the same ethnicity, ranging in age from 56 to 85 years. All the patients were hospitalized in the Department of Neurology/neurosurgery in Prime Multi specialty Hospital, MK Neuro centre and Bhatia Neuro and Multi specialty Hospital, Patiala from November 2018 to November 2021. Initially, 680 subjects were screened but after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria (Figure  1 ), 219 subjects were enrolled for the study. Excluding some unconfirmed cases, finally, 200 confirmed ischaemic stroke patients were included after verification by the criteria of ‘Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment’ (TOAST) (Adams et al.,  1993 ). All the patients had undergone magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Two neurologists resolved the identification of IS subtypes independent of each other. Interobserver reliability for differentiating stroke subtype was substantial  $(\kappa=0.71–0.78)$  . For control subjects 654 individuals were screened initially. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria (Figure  1 ), 200 subjects were tested and verified normal after applying Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke Free Status (QVSFS) (Jones et al.,  2001 ). Interobserver reliability for the identification of control subject was almost perfect   $(\kappa=0.87$  ). All the subjects gave their written consent and the study was approved by Institutional Ethical Committee affiliated to Punjabi University, Patiala (IEC no. 2019/130). The present research complied strictly to the ethical guidelines prescribed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

# 2.2 Risk variables  

Demographic characteristics of age and gender along with information on other risk parameters such as smoking, alcohol drinking and physical activity was collected from the subjects through questionnaire or medical records. Arterial blood pressure was noted down at baseline. All lipid parameters were available in the medical records of ischaemic stroke patients. Plasma levels of CRP, IL $1\beta$   and IL-18 were determined using enzyme-linked immuno s or bent assay (ELISA) kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All the tests were done on a microplate reader (Biotek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) with analytical sensitivities of the kits  ${<}10$   $6.25\,\mathsf{p g/m l}$   for CRP, IL  $1\beta$   and IL18, respectively. While assaying these three parameters, coefficients of inter and intra-assay variation was observed to be less than 6%.  

# 2.3 SNP selection and genotyping  

SNPs within NLRP3 gene were selected in the present study following four criteria: (i) SNP having functional effect on NLRP3 mRNA, (ii) SNP must be validated by independent submissions to the NCBI reference SNP cluster ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ), (iii) SNP should be polymorphic (having allele frequency at least   $5\%$  ) and (iv) previously shown association with either NLRP3 in fl amma some activation or with inflammatory disorders. In this way, 5 SNPs rs10754558 (3 ′ UTR), rs4612666 (intron 7), rs2027432 (3661 bp upstream), rs3738448 (2667 bp upstream) and rs1539019 (intron 8) were selected and genotyped.  

DNAs were extracted from whole blood with salting out procedure (Miller et al.,  1988 ). Amplification of DNA was performed on BioRad   $\mathsf{T100^{\mathrm{TM}}}$  Thermal Cycler (Hercules, California, USA). Twenty-five micro litres of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixture contained  $2\,\mu{\mathrm{I}}$  of DNA template,   $12.5\,\mu|$   of master mix,  $5.5\,\mu|$   of nuclease free water and   $2.5\,\mu|$   each of forward and reverse primers. PCR cycle conditions for the amplification of the DNA were: initial de natura tion condition at  $95^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  for 40 s, annealing at  with final extension at 72  $55^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   $72^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  ◦ C for 5 min. After amplification, the prodcycl for   $30~s$  th de natura tion o nd extension at 72  $72^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  ◦ C for 30 s  at  $94^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  ucts of the SNPs rs10754558, rs4612666, rs2027432, rs3738448 and rs1539019 were digested with high fidelity restriction enzymes,  Mbo I, Bps I,  BstE II,  Tse I and  BseR I, respectively (New England Biolabs Inc., Massachusetts, USA) as shown in Table  1 . Digested products were analysed on  $2\%$   agarose gel having ethidium bromide to identify the presence or absence of the restriction site ( Supplementary Figures ). To avoid any bias, genotyping was performed by blinding the case control status of the samples. Ten per cent of the known positive/negative samples were re-analysed to confirm the internal consistency.

# 2.4 Statistical power  

Statistical power in the present study was calculated as a priori power analysis according to the method given by Cohen ( 1988 ) using software  $G^{*}$  Power. The power  $(1-\beta)$   was calculated which revealed that sample size of 400 (200 cases, 200 controls) would deliver  $88\%$   statistical power   =  correct null efficiently with Cohen’s  $D=0.5$   and significance  $\alpha\!=\!0.05$  Supplementary file ).  

# 2.5 Statistical analysis  

All the differences between variables were analysed by either Student’s  t -test or Mann-Whitney    $U$   test, if values were continuous, otherwise differences in categories were analysed by chi-square test. Allele frequencies were calculated from genotype numbers and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was checked using chi-square statistics. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the contribution of respective SNPs under unadjusted and adjusted additive, dominant, recessive and multiplicative models. Extent and degree of the independent contribution of risk variables for IS risk was assessed with uni variable and multivariable regression analysis. Haplotypes were determined using genotype data in software Arlequin ver. 3.01. To identify IS risk conferred by different haplotypes, crude and adjusted odds ratio (corrected with significant risk variables) were determined using logistic regression models after taking most common haplotype as referent. Difference between haplotypes was calculated and  $p$   value was adjusted with Bonferroni correction. The functional effect of the susceptibility putative haplotype was further examined with Wald’s statistics through dominant, recessive, multiplicative or general models. The model, which best explained its impact on the risk of IS was selected with least Akaike information criterion (AIC) value and highest haplotype uncertainty measure   $(R^{2}h)$  . The association of significant risk predictors with susceptibility putative haplotype was analysed according to its dosage (0 copy, 1 copy or 2 copies) by using logistic regression analysis allowing two-tailed  $p<.05$  , o erwise for multiple comparisons, significance level was set at 1%  $\left(p<.01\right)$  .  

# 3 RESULTS  

# 3.1 Baseline features of the study group  

Out of 200 confirmed IS patients,   $82\%$   (164) had large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) and  $7\%$   (14) had car dio embolism (CE). Five per cent each (10) had small vascular occlusion (SVO) and stroke of determined aetiology whereas  $1\%$   (2) had stroke of undetermined aetiology. Demographic, physiological, biochemical and genetic characteristics of cases and controls revealed that both the groups were matched for age and gender   $(p>.05)$   as shown in Table  2 . Smoking, systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were observed to be significantly dissimilar between cases and controls   $(p<.001)$  . No significant differences were found for alcohol drinking, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol (TC) levels between both the groups. This would have been validated by splitting the data in different age groups, but doing so would significantly reduce the statistical power of the study and inferences would be erroneous. IS patients had significantly higher log median values of CRP, IL $1\beta$   and IL-18 than controls. Five SNPs of NLRP3 gene were investigated, results of which exhibited that minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of rs10754558, rs4612666 and 19 were significantly higher in cases than controls   $(p<.05)$  . MAFs of rs2027432 and rs3738448 were similar in both the groups  >  $\left(p>.05\right)$  

# 3.2 Identification of independent risk variables for ischaemic stroke  

Uni variable regression analysis was performed by taking IS risk as dependent variable (Table  3 ), which revealed that higher levels of SBP

It was revealed that gender, smoking, alcohol drinking, DBP,  > TG, HDL and TC did not influence the IS risk (  $\left(p>.05\right)$   .05). All the variables that showed significant association in uni variable model were included

# 3.3 Genetic association of NLRP3 gene SNPs with IS risk through genetic models  

Genetic contribution of individual SNPs within NLRP3 gene was examined based on possession of risk alleles after taking major allele as referent (Table  4 ). All the alleles of 5 SNPs were observed to be in Hardy-Weinber uilibrium   $(p>.05)$  djusted model, minor a G of SNP rs10754558 exhibited IS risk through additive in homozy = gous (OR: 2.16  $95\%$   =  $p=.03.$  OR: 1.65; 95%  =  $p\,{=}\,.02$   $95\%$   $p\!=\!.01.$   .01) modes. Minor allele T of SNP rs4612666 revealed genetic association with IS risk through additive in heterozygous (OR: 1.68;   $95\%$   =  $p=.003)$  ), hom ous .21;   $95\%$   =  $p=.03)$   .03), dominant (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.16–2.69,  $p=.01$   .01) and multiplicative (OR: 1.  $95\%$  5% CI: 1.09–1.9  $p\,{=}\,.01$  allele T of SNP rs1539019 showed IS risk through additive in heterozy = : 1.78; 95  $95\%$   =  $p=.01$  , hom ous ( ; 95% CI: 1.06–4.20,  =  $p=.047)$   .047), dominant (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.23–2.74,  =  $p=.004)$   .004) and multiplicative (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.16–2.13,  $p=.004\rangle$  modes. Other SNPs, that is, rs2027432 and rs3738448 did not show any genotype-specific associations for IS risk.  

# 3.4 Haplotype association and their functional implications exhibited in best fit model  

Haplotypes were generated from the genotype data in the order of rs10754558, rs4612666, rs2027432, rs3738448 and rs1539019 (Table  5 ). Out of expected 32 haplotypes, only 17 were evident and out of these 11 haplotypes had frequencies less than 0.05 hence, excluded from the analysis. Finally, six putative haplotypes captured   $83\%$   of genetic variation within IS patients and   $68\%$   genetic variation for

control subjects. Major alleles of 4 SNPs at position 1, 2, 3 and 5 and minor allele of SNP rs3738488 at position 4 constituted a putative haplotype CCGTT, which appeared to be the most prevalent in cases and controls, hence it was considered referent for the analysis. Minor alleles of all the studied NLRP3 SNPs at all the positions except third, where major allele participated to constitute a putative haplotype GTGTA, which was observed to be risky for the IS risk (OR: 2.16;  $95\%$   C 4.24,  $p=.03,$  ). Inter-group comparisons of this putative haplotype after Bonferroni correction also showed significant differ = ences (  $(p=.02)$   .02). Further analysis after adjusting the effect of th isky putative haplotype with significant risk variables (SBP, CRP, IL-1  $1\beta$   and IL-18) revealed that it was in fact a susceptibility putative haplotype, carriers of which were at two times higher risk of IS than those who did not have it (OR: 1.98;  $95\%$   CI: 1.12–3.78,  $p\,{=}\,.04,$  ).  

In order to understand that in which best possible way of genetic model, this susceptibility putative haplotype GT GTA influenced the risk of IS, rigorous analysis was done using Wald’s statistics (Table  6 ). Model was selected on the basis of least AIC (Akaike information criterion) and highest  $R^{2}h$   (Stram’s haplotype uncertainty measure). Analysis verified that susceptibility putative haplotype GTGTA residing within  ± NLR  < nfluenced the risk of IS in dominant mode ( β  SE:   $1.95\pm$  0.58,  $p\!<\!.001]$  

# 3.5 Association of susceptibility putative haplotypes with independent risk predictors  

Association of susceptibility putative haplotype GTGTA with independent risk predictors was analysed according to possession of no copy, one copy or two copies (Figure  2 ). Analysis exposed that sus ce pti bility putative haplotype GTGTA was significantly associated with CRP  $(\beta=1.21\$   =  $p=.014,$   =  $\cdot1\beta$     $(\beta=1.53$   =  $p=.034,$   = vels but not with SBP (  $(\beta=0.018$   $p=.34.$   .34) and IL-18 (  $(\beta=0.012$   $p=.26.$   .26). It was revealed that this putative haplotype influenced in dose-dependent manner as carriers of one copy or two copies of GTGTA had higher values of CRP and IL $1\beta$   levels (0.8 and  $0.88\;\mathrm{mg/L},$  ) than those who did not have this putative haplotype   $(0.65\,\mathsf{m g/L})$  ).  

# 4 DISCUSSION  

Almost 20 years ago, Martinon et al. ( 2002 ) unwrinkled for the first time, the dilemma of inflammation activation by suggesting that a multiprotein complex exists (in fl amma some), assembly of which activates Caspase-1 and triggers cascade of pro-inflammatory markers such as IL $1\beta$   and IL-18. After 6 years, it was observed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation has some genetic implications (Kastbom et al.,  2008 ). Consequently, it was discovered that SNP rs10754558 is functional and regulates mRNA expression of NL RP 3 in fl amma some(Hitomietal., 2009 ). For the first time, present study has exposed that a sus ce pti bility putative haplotype (GTGTA) within NLRP3 gene influences IS risk and correlates with dose-dependent increased concentrations of IL $1\beta$  and IL-18 in the population of Punjab, India.  

Five SNPs within NLRP3 gene (rs10754558, rs4612666, rs2027432, rs3738448 and rs1539019) have been investigated, which reveal that minor allele G of functional SNP rs10754558 associates significantly with IS risk in additive, dominant and multiplicative models after adjusting the effect of confounding variables (SBP, CRP,

Additive model exhibits that risk for ischaemic stroke increases by  r  fold for heterozygote AB and  $r^{2}$    for homozygous BB. Dominant model: either one or two copies of allele B are required for  r  fold increased risk. Recessive model: two copies of allele B are required for  r  fold increased risk. Multiplicative model: each additional B allele increases  r  fold risk.

Another study on Chinese population (Cheng et al.,  2018 ) has shown that minor allele T of SNP rs4612666 is significantly associated with higher IS risk. This inference is corroborated by the present study, whereby T allele of this SNP influences IS risk in additive (CT, TT), dominant and multiplicative modes. In addition to other genetic variants studied hitherto, present study has shown that minor allele A of SNP rs1539019 is associated with IS risk in additive, dominant and multiplicative modes.

or additional copy of minor alleles G, T and A is required to impact IS risk as these SNPs exhibit their effect in dominant and multiplicative modes.  

Although effects of these SNPs have been observed after adjusting with significant variables (SBP, CRP, IL $_{1\beta}$   and IL-18), but individual SNP fails to capture overall effect, as these interact and collaborate, especially when SNPs are non-randomly associated with one another. Hence, haplotypes have been investigated which reveal that minor alleles G, T, T and A of SNPs rs10754558, rs4612666, rs3738448 and rs1539019 and major allele G of SNP rs2027432 collaborate and influence IS risk in the form of putative haplotype GTGTA. When the effect of this putative haplotype is adjusted with independent risk variables (SBP, CRP, IL $1\beta$  a susceptibility putative haplotype, which confers approximately double the risk for IS. Cheng et al. ( 2018 ) have observed a risky haplotype TGT (in order of rs4612666, rs10754558 and rs7512998) for IS, which endorses the inference that two alleles G and T of S NPr s 10754558 and rs4612666 collaborate on the position 2 and 3 in the haplotype GTGTA in the present study also. Nonetheless, present study has also explored the possible way in which this putative haplotype GTGTA exerts its impact for the risk of IS, revealing that it influences in dominant mode suggesting that even carriage of a single copy of this putative haplotype is sufficient to exacerbate IS risk.Carriers of this putative ha plo type are at double the risk of IS and are more vulnerable to increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers CRP and IL $1\beta$  , which has been confirmed by the observation that possession of one copy or two copies of this putative haplotype is significantly correlated with higher levels of CRP and IL-1 β  in comparison to subjects having no copy of this putative haplotype.  

It is verified in this study that higher levels of SBP, CRP, IL $1\beta$   and IL-18 are independent risk predictors for IS risk in the population of Punjab, India. Nonetheless, SBP and IL-18 have failed to associate with susceptibility putative haplotype GTGTA suggesting that although higher levels of these both variables influence IS pathology but operate independent of genetic connotation of NLRP3 in fl amma some. It has been observed lately that NLRP3 in fl amma some activation also participates in NETosis, a process whereby neutrophils in response to innate immunity, set the wheel of autoimmunity and inflammation within plaqued arteries (Münzer et al.,  2021 ). It is well understood that increased CRP concentrations with   $_{12\;\mathsf{h}}$   of ischaemic stroke is independent prognostic marker for worst outcomes of higher Rankin Scale Scores and death (den Hertog et al.,  2009 ). Moreover, higher CRP levels at admission and discharge are predictors for 1 year risk of either new vascular event or death (Di Napoli et al.,  2001 ). It has been observed

that LDL retention in endo the li al cells trigger atherosclerosis, whereby CRP plays a major role in its progression through the activation of NLRP3 in fl amma some (Bian et al.,  2019 ). Dose-dependent relationship of putative haplotype GTGTA as genetic determinant of higher CRP levels in the present study has enlightened this finding, but also instils curiosity that whether role of CRP in LDL trans cyto s is-induced atherosclerosis is independent or having bidirectional relationship with NLRP3 in fl amma some activation.  

Higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL $1\beta$   has been strongly implicated in stroke pathology (Boutin et al.,  2001 ). Present abundantly in atheromatous lesions in stroke patients, it participates in plaque development, its stability and progression to ischaemia (Paramel Verghese et al.,  2016 ). Therefore, suppression of NLRP3 in fl amma some-induced IL $_{1\beta}$   production has proved fruitful in managing the stroke volume, infarct size and post-ischaemic neuroinflammation (Dong et al.,  2021 ). Present study has clarified for the first time that relationship of IL $1\beta$   secretion during NLRP3 inflammasome activation is genetically mediated, as five SNPs within NLRP3 gene in the form of putative haplotype GTGTA are associated with the increased concentrations of IL $1\beta$   in IS patients having one copy, which further increases with carriage of two copies. Albeit, GTGTA haplotype within NLRP3 gene influences the risk of IS via mediation of increased levels of CRP and IL $\cdot1\beta$   in dose-dependent manner in the population of Punjab, but it does not defy the viewpoint that expression of genes vary according to different ethnicities (Huang et al.,  2015 ); hence caution is urged in the interpretation of results.  

# 5 CONCLUSION  

The present study has revealed that minor alleles of SNPs rs10754558, rs46124666 and rs1539019 of NLRP3 in fl amma some are significantly associated with IS risk after correcting the effect of significant risk predictors. A susceptibility putative haplotype GTGTA exists within NLRP3 gene, which exacerbates IS risk in dominant genetic model. Furthermore, this putative haplotype is genetically associated with increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory markers CRP and IL $1\beta$  in dose-dependent manner.
