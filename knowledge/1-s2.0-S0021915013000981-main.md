Objective:  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at microRNA (miRNA) binding sites (miRSNPs) can affect the expression of genes. This study aimed to identify the miR-SNPs associated with atherosclerosis and stroke. Methods:  Patients with ischemic stroke   $'n=657$  ) and stroke- and myocardial infarction-free volunteers  $\cdot n=1571$  ) were enrolled. The carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured in the control participants. Seventy-nine stroke susceptibility genes were initially selected and 13 genes were predicted to have miR-SNPs at their  $3^{\prime}$    untranslated regions (3 0 UTR). The miRNA arrays were used to further identify potential miR-SNPs. The miR-SNP rs3735590 at the para oxon as e 1 (PON1) gene was  ﬁ nally selected and its associations with stroke and carotid IMT were evaluated. The 3 0 UTR reporter and SNP functional assays were then performed to validate the results. Results:  Compared with CC genotype, patients with CT or TT genotype at rs3735590 had lower risk of ischemic stroke   $.0\mathtt{R}=0.72$  ,    $p=0.036$  ;   $\mathrm{OR}=0.83$  ,  $p=0.077,$  , respectively). Among the healthy participants, the CT or TT genotype was associated with thinner IMT in the internal carotid arteries in comparison with CC genotype   $\beta\,=\,-0.76$  ,    $p\,=\,0.003$  ;    $\beta\,=\,-0.022$  ,    $p\,=\,0.452$  , respectively). Our  ﬁ ndings suggested that the minor allele T had a protective effect on atherosclerosis. Results from 3 0 UTR reporter assays showed that PON1 is a direct target gene of miR-616. In plasmid constructs carrying the risk allele C at rs3735590, miR-616 inhibited the genetic expression of PON1. However, substitution of C by T at rs3735590 reduced the miR-616 binding af ﬁ nity, leading to over expression of the PON1 gene. Conclusion:  Our study is the  ﬁ rst to show that the miR-SNP at PON1 could affect genetic expression and is associated with an elevated risk for ischemic stroke and sub clinical atherosclerosis.

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Ischemic stroke is a complex and multi factorial disease caused by environmental and genetic factors  [1 e 3] . Carotid intimamedia thickness (IMT) is a good surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and an independent predictor of cardiovascular events  [4] . Previous studies have shown that IMT correlates well with pathologically and clinically de ﬁ ned atherosclerosis, and is regulated by genetic factors with a heritability ranging from  $30\%$   to  $60\%$   [5,6] .  

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs of approximately 21 nucleotides. A miRNA can bind to the   $3^{\prime}$    untranslated region (UTR) of its target mRNA to post-transcription ally regulate genes. Studies have shown that miRNAs play a role in several biological processes, including embryonic development, cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, fat metabolism, atherosclerosis and oncogene s is [7,8] . In our previous studies, several miRNAs (e.g., miR-29b and let7) are found to be involved in the at hero sclerotic process  [9,10] . We also showed that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) induces epigenetic modi ﬁ cation and signaling regulation of the miR-29b gene, which plays a path o physiological role in cardiovascular disease (CVD)  [10] .  

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant form of DNA variation in the human genome  [11] . Brodersen and Voinnet  [12]  showed that SNPs within the binding site of miRNA can affect miRNA-induced genetic repression. If an SNP can in ﬂ uence the binding of a miRNA to its target gene, this SNP is called a miRSNP  [13] . Therefore, a miR-SNP can affect gene expression levels to in ﬂ uence susceptibility to disease  [14] . We recently reported that a miR-SNP (rs662702) in the paired box 6 (PAX6) gene was associated with extreme myopia in the Chinese population  [15] . We later demonstrated that this SNP in ﬂ uences miR-328 binding to the PAX6 gene, leading to altered myopic risk  [16] . Given the regulatory role of miRNAs in gene expression, miR-SNPs could provide promising markers for the identi ﬁ cation of risk of atherosclerosis.  

In this study, we aimed to identify miR-SNPs that in ﬂ uence carotid IMT and risk of stroke. Using results from previous studies, we selected 79 genes associated with stroke pathogen es is, and then we systematically searched for miR-SNPs located in these strokerelated genes. We used miRNA expression pro ﬁ les in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to further identify the candidate miRSNPs. After evaluating the associations between the candidate miRSNPs and phenotypes of interest, we conducted reporter assays to con ﬁ rm the effects of the miR-SNPs.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. Patients and participants  

The ischemic stroke patients were recruited from Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (KMUH) from 2006 to 2010. Their diagnoses were based on the World Health Organization criteria for ischemic stroke  [17] . During the same period, healthy volunteers aged 18 years and over were enrolled through advertisements at KMUH for ongoing atherosclerosis studies in which carotid IMT would be measured. A healthy participant had no self-reported history of stroke or MI.  

The healthy participants were used as controls when evaluating the associations between the SNPs and stroke status. To reduce the effects of age and sex, only age- and sex-matched controls were selected. First, a table of random numbers was used to eliminate control participants aged between 20 and 60 years without deleting any stroke cases until the differences in age between cases and controls were non-signi ﬁ cant. The procedure was performed separately in men and in women. Because men accounted for approximately two-thirds of the stroke cases, a larger proportion of the female controls was deleted compared to the male controls. The table of random numbers was generated using SPSS software. After the elimination of 884 controls, both age and sex data in the overall cases and their matched controls displayed non-signi ﬁ cant differences.  

All study participants were Han Chinese descendants residing in Taiwan. A previous study investigating the population admixture of Chinese people residing in Taiwan showed high homogeneity among Taiwanese sub populations  [18] . Therefore, population strati ﬁ cation should not have affected our study results.  

Demographic data and a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking were obtained from each study participant. Blood pressure measurements were collected using a calibrated standard aneroid sph yg moma no meter (Omron, Vernon Hills, Illinois) after participants had been seated for at least 5 min. The average values from 2 measurements were used for analysis. Venous blood was collected after fasting for  $8\mathrm{~h~}$  . Participants were de ﬁ ned as having hypertension if they had a systolic blood pressure  ${\geq}140\;\mathrm{mm}\;\mathrm{Hg}$   or diastolic pressure  ${\geq}90~\mathrm{mm~Hg}$  , or were taking anti hypertensive medication. Participants were de ﬁ ned as having diabetes if they had fasting blood glucose  $^{\ge126\:\mathrm{mg/dL}}$   or were taking hypoglycemic medication. Participants were de ﬁ ned as having hypercholesterolemia if they had total serum cholesterol levels (TC)  ${\geq}240\;\mathrm{mg/dL}$  . Total serum cholesterol levels were determined using standardized enzymatic procedures (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Participants were de ﬁ ned as smokers if they had ever smoked (including current or previous smokers). A previous smoker was de ﬁ ned as a participant who had stopped smoking during the year prior to enrollment. All study protocols and methods were approved by the Institutional Review Board of KMUH, and all participants provided written informed consent.  

# 2.2. Carotid ultra sonography studies  

Ultrasonic examinations were performed using a Philips HD 11 ultra sonography system equipped with a   $7.5{-}10~\mathrm{Hz}$   linear array transducer (Philips Design, Eindhoven, Netherlands). An experienced technician who was blind to patients ’  clinical data collected all ultrasonic measurements. Participants were examined in a supine position. The transducer scanning direction was anterior-oblique insonation. The far walls of the carotid IMT were visualized bilaterally, and the IMT values were measured at the plaque-free area of the common carotid artery (CCA;   $10\,\mathrm{mm}{-}20\,\mathrm{mm}$  proximal to the tip of the  ﬂ ow divider), carotid bifurcation (Bif; tip of the  ﬂ ow divider and extending   $10~\mathrm{mm}$   proximally), and internal carotid artery (ICA; proximal   $10\:\mathrm{mm}$   above the bulb) separately. An automated computerized analyzing system (Philips Qlab quanti ﬁ cation software) was used to increase the measurement accuracy. This new computerized technique automatically detected the echo interfaces  [19] , and manual corrections were performed when there was no automatic outlining of the lumen-intima or the media e adventia interface. The mean IMT of both right and left carotid arteries from each segment were used in analyzes. The intrareader IMT differences between 2 readings and their standard deviations (SD) were  $0.01\pm0.01\,\mathrm{mm}$   in the CCA,   $0.03\pm0.04\,\mathrm{mm}$   in the Bif, and   $0.02\pm0.01\ \mathrm{mm}$   in the ICA. All ultrasonic data were interpreted by a single neurologist (Hsiu-Fen Lin).  

# 2.3. Selection of candidate gene and miR-SNP  

Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PUBMED) between January 2000 and June 2012 were searched for all association studies investigating genes associated with risk of stroke. The medical subject headings, terms, and text words used for the search were cerebro vascular disease, stroke, cerebral ischemia, and cerebro vascular disorder, combined with polymorphism, genotype, gene, allele, or mutation. The search results were limited to human studies and articles written in English. Meta-analyzes on genes associated with risk of stroke were also speci ﬁ cally searched for. Studies were excluded if (1) any participant was under 18 years of age, (2) the sample size was less than 1000 participants, or (3) the tested genes failed to show any signi ﬁ cant association with stroke. Our initial search identi ﬁ ed 355 manuscripts, of which 107 ful ﬁ lled the inclusion criteria.  Supplemental Table 1 displays the 79 selected genes.  

To select the candidate miR-SNPs, the 3 0 UTR sequences of the 79 genes from the database of the University of California, Santa Cruz were  ﬁ rst obtained ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ). The BLAST-SNP algorithm from the dbSNP database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ SNP/snp blast By Chr.html ) was used to identify SNPs located at the 3 0 UTR. Only SNPs with known frequencies in the Chinese population in the dbSNP database were considered. MiRanda software ( http://www.microrna.org ) was then used to predict the binding between miRNAs and sequences surrounding the initially included SNPs. Only SNPs located within the sequences complementary to the seed region of miRNAs were selected.  

# 2.4. MicroRNA arrays for further  ﬁ ltering  

Data from miRNA arrays were then used to investigate the differential expression of miRNAs binding to candidate SNPs during atherosclerosis. VSMCs were obtained from Cascade Biologics

 (Portland, OR, USA). VSMCs were cultured in a VSMC growth medium

 (Medium 231, Cascade Biologics, Inc., OR, USA). The VSMC growth medium consisted of a fetal bovine serum (FBS,   $5\%.$  ) containing human epidermal growth factor   $(10~\mathrm{{ng/mL})}$  , human basic  ﬁ broblast growth factor   $(3\;\mathrm{ng/mL})$  ), insulin   $(10~\mathrm{mg/mL})$  , penicillin (100 units/ mL), streptomycin   $;100~\mathrm{{pg/mL}})$  , and Fungizone   $(1.25~\mathrm{mg/mL})$  ). Cells were seeded at a density of   $1.5\times10^{5}$    cells/well on collagen-coated 12-well plates and maintained at   $37~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   in a humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere of  $95\%$   air  $I5\%$   carbon dioxide   $\left({\sf C O}_{2}\right)$  . Cells were subculture d when they reached  $70\%–80\%$  con ﬂ uence. For miRNA array experiments (OneArray microRNA expression pro ﬁ ling micro arrays; Phalanx Biotech Group, Taiwan), VSMCs were treated with a regular culture medium containing 40  $\upmu\mathrm{g/mL}$  OxLDL or  $100\ \ \ \mathrm{mg/mL}$  lip o polysaccharide (LPS) for  $24\,\mathrm{h}$   to induce at hero sclerotic changes. The commercial array uses spotted probes to interrogate 1087 human miRNAs. If the selected SNP is located in a pro a the rogen ic gene, the correspondent miRNA would be expected to be downregulated in the OxLDL- and LPS-treated VSMCs, and vice versa. Therefore, only SNPs with correspondent miRNAs in the right direction of differential expression levels were selected ( ﬂ owchart, Fig. 1 ).  

# 2.5. Genotyping and statistical analysis  

Genotyping was conducted using TaqMan technology. In brief, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) probes were designed, and reactions were performed in 96-well microplates with ABI 9700 thermal cyclers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Fluorescence was measured using the ABI 7900 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and analyzed using System SDS software version 1.2.3.  

Genotype data were tested for Hardy e Weinberg equilibrium using the goodness-ofﬁ t test. The chi-squared test was used to evaluate the differences in genotype distribution between stroke cases and controls. Multivariate regression analysis with adjustment for traditional risk factors (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking) was then used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence intervals (CI) for the risk genotype. Stepwise forward selection was used to identify signi ﬁ cant variables with  $p<0.05$   in multivariate regression analysis.  

Among the healthy controls, IMT was used as a phenotype for carotid atherosclerosis. The associations between genotypes and carotid IMT were analyzed using multivariate regression models with adjustment for conventional risk factors (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking). All statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 13.0).  

# 2.6. Materials used in functional analyzes  

Luciferase Assay System and cloning kits were purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI, USA). Trizol reagents and

lip of ect amine were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA), and OxLDL and LPS were purchased from Biomedical Technologies (Stoughton, MA, USA). The characteristics of the commercial OxLDL was shown in  Supplemental Table 2 . The microRNA mimic was supplied by Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primer sets were synthesized by Mission Biotech (Nankang, Taiwan). The reagents used in a cell culture were purchased from GIBCO-BRL (Grand Island, NY, USA). Unless otherwise speci ﬁ ed, all other reagents were of analytical grade.  

# 2.7. Construction of the PON1 3 0 UTR reporter plasmid for reporter assay  

The PCR was performed using sets of primers listed in Supplemental Table 3 . To ensure speci ﬁ city for the PON1 3 0 UTR, the forward primer was SpeI-site-linked and the reverse primer was MluI-site-linked. The human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell line was grown in a Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium containing   $1\%$   penicillin/streptomycin and a  $10\%$   heat-in activated FBS. HEK 293 genomic DNA was used as the template. The 1268-bp PCR products were digested using SpeI and MluI, and cloned into the downstream area of the luciferase gene in the pMIR-REPORT luciferase vector (Ambion). This vector was sequenced and named pMIR-PON1-3 0 UTR. Site-directed mutagen es is of the miR616 target site in the PON1 3 0 UTR was performed using the '   QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagen es is Kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). The vector with the mutant miR-616 binding site was named the pMIR-PON1-3 0 UTR-mutant. For reporter assays, cells were transient ly trans fec ted with reporter plasmids harboring the original or mutated sequences of PON1 and the miR-616 mimic using Lip of ect amine 2000 (Invitrogen). The pEGFP plasmids were co-trans fec ted as the internal control. The reporter assay was performed   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   post-transfection using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega).  

# 2.8. Construction of reporter plasmids for miR-SNP rs3735590  

Because statistical analyzes indicated that the miR-SNP rs3735590 was signi ﬁ cantly associated with stroke and atherosclerosis (see  “ Results ”  for details), the functional consequences of SNP rs3735590 were further assessed. Two vectors were constructed, each carrying one allele of the SNP. The synthesized double-stranded oli go nucleotides containing 22 bp surrounding SNP rs3735590 were constructed in 3 tandem copies, with each copy containing 22 bp. The restriction enzymes SpeI and MluI were used for the cloning of sites. The oli go nucleotides that contained the 3 tandem copies were cloned into the pMIR-REPORT luciferase vector using T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs, Boston, MA). One reporter construct carried risk allele C (rs3735590C) and the other carried protective allele T (rs3735590T). The primer sets are listed in  Supplemental Table 3 . All constructs were con ﬁ rmed using DNA sequencing.  

To conduct transfection experiments, HEK 293 cells were trans fec ted using Lip of ect amine 2000 with  $50~\mathrm{{nM}}$   miR-616 mimic and 600 ng rs3735590C or rs3735590T plasmids. The pEGFP plasmids (  ${100}\,\mathrm{ng})$  ) were also co-trans fec ted into cells, and the GFP value was used as an internal control. After incubation for   $24\,\mathrm{h}$  , luciferase activity was measured. Each experiment was independently repeated 3 times and each sample was evaluated in triplicate. Using the Mann e  $p$   value of 0.05 was considered signi ﬁ cant.  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. MicroRNA array analysis and selection of candidate SNPs  

MiRanda prediction software selected 17 SNPs at 13 genes ( Supplemental Table 4 ). We divided the 13 target genes into 3 groups according to their a the rogen ic characteristics. Group 1 contained 4 genes with no known function related to at hero genesis (AKAP13/SORBS1/TYMS/UBR3); excluding the SNPs located in these genes, Group 2 contained 6 pro at hero sclerotic genes   $(\mathsf{A B O}/$  CYP11B2/F13A1/IL6R/ITGA2/TCN2), and Group 3 contained 3 antia the rogen ic genes (CBS/PON1/UCP3). We further examined MiRNAs paired with pro at hero sclerotic or anti a the rogen ic genes based on their differential expression in miRNA array data ( Supplemental Table 4 ). We did not observe consistent reductions in miRNAs corresponding to the 6 pro a the rogen ic genes in OxLDL- and LPStreated VSMCs; therefore, we excluded the SNPs located in these 6 genes. Among the miRNAs corresponding to the 3 anti a the rogen ic genes, only miR-616 that binds to PON1 displayed increased expression in the OxLDL- and LPS-treated VSMCs. Therefore, we selected miR-SNP rs3735590 at the PON1 gene, and predicted the major allele C as having close pairing with miR-616 ( ﬂ owchart, Fig. 1 ).  

# 3.2. Participants for the stroke case e control study  

We evaluated 657 stroke cases and 1571 stroke- and myocardial infarction (MI)-free participants.  Table 1  displays the demographic features of the study population. Men accounted for   $64.5\%$   of the stroke patients and  $45.4\%$   of the healthy participants (  $\mathbf{\dot{\rho}}p<0.001\mathbf{\dot{\rho}}$  ). The average ages  $(y)$   and their standard deviations (SD) of the cases and healthy participants were   $62.23\:\pm\:11.72\$   and   $54.56\,\pm\,10.55$  , respectively   $\left(p<0.001\right)$  ). As expected, the prevalence of several risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking, was higher in the stroke cases than in the healthy participants   $(p<0.05)$  . The stroke case e control study included 687 age- and sex-matched controls ( Table 1 ). The genotype distribution of PON1 rs3735590 was in Hardy e Weinberg equilibrium. Compared with CC genotype, patients with CT   $'n\,=\,118,$  ) or TT

  $\dot{}n=5.$  ) genotype at rs3735590 had lower risk of ischemic stroke

 (  $\mathtt{O R}=0.72$  ,  $p=0.036$  ;  ${\tt O R}=0.83$  ,  $p=0.077,$  , respectively).  

# 3.3. Carotid IMT  

We further evaluated the association between PON1 rs3735590 and carotid atherosclerosis in the healthy participants. IMT data were not available for every stroke subject, or their IMT data had not been collected systematically. Therefore, we focused only on the effects of SNPs in the healthy controls. In 1571 healthy controls, the distributions of sex, age, cardiovascular risk factors, and smoking status were similar among the three rs3735590 genotypes  $\dot{p}>0.05$  ;  Supplemental Table 5 ). Consistent with the effects of the SNPs on stroke, the CT   $'n=367.$   or TT (  $'n\,=\,19,$  ) genotype was associated with thinner IMT in the internal carotid arteries in comparison with CC genotype (  $\beta=-0.76$  ,  $p=0.003$  ;  $\beta=-0.022$  ,  $p=0.452$  , respectively) ( Table 2 ).  

# 3.4. MicroRNA-616 and PON1  

To con ﬁ rm the binding of miR-616 to PON1 3 0 UTR, we constructed a 1268-bp DNA segment of PON1 3 0 UTR containing the predicted miR-616 binding site. We mutated 5 nucleotides of PON1 that are paired to the seed region of miR-616 using site-directed mutagen es is to eradicate binding between miR-616 and PON1 ( Fig. 2 A). We co-trans fec ted the pMIR-PON1-3 0 UTR construct plasmids and miR-616 mimic into HEK 293 cells. The miR-616 mimic dose-dependent ly reduced luciferase activity in the HEK

293 cells trans fec ted with original constructs ( Fig. 2 B), whereas the miR-616 mimic did not affect luciferase activity in cells with mutant constructs ( Fig. 2 C). These  ﬁ ndings supported that miR-616 negatively regulates the expression of PON1.  

# 3.5. The effects of SNP rs3735590 on miR-616 binding ability  

To evaluate the effects of the 2 alleles of rs3735590 on miR-616 binding af ﬁ nity to the PON1 3 0 UTR, we constructed 2 reporter constructs (rs3735590C and rs3735590T). The miR-616 mimic reduced luciferase activity signi ﬁ cantly in the cells trans fec ted with rs3735590C constructs ( Fig. 3 ). However, the knockdown effect of the miR-616 mimic was less evident in the rs3735590T constructs ( Fig. 3 ). The differences in the knockdown effect between the 2 constructs were highly signi ﬁ cant   $\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{\dot{\rho}}p=0.0002.}\end{array}$  ).  

# 4. Discussion  

Our study results showed that miR-SNP rs3735590 at PON1 can in ﬂ uence a person ’ s susceptibility to ischemic stroke and asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis. They also indicated that the common CC genotype increases IMT values at the ICA segment signi ﬁ cantly, which might contribute to a higher risk of stroke. Our results from functional analyzes indicated that miR-616 negatively regulates PON1 expression. Luciferase reporter assays further showed that the 2 alleles of SNP rs3735590 cause the differential binding af ﬁ nities for miR-616 and PON1. Based on our reporter assay results, the risk C allele causes lower expression of PON1 in the presence of miR-616, which is consistent with the results from IMT and stroke association studies. Our  ﬁ ndings suggested that miR-SNP rs3735590 might play a critical role in the susceptibility to ischemic stroke and the development of atherosclerosis by affecting miR-616 binding to PON1.  

Human PON1 inhibits oxidation in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) through hydrolysis of lipid peroxides  [20,21] . In human studies, decreased PON1 level and impaired PON1 catalytic activity were associated with increased risk of stroke  [22]  and atherosclerosis  [23] . Previous studies on genetically modi ﬁ ed mice have provided the most convincing evidence to associate PON1 with atherosclerosis  [24,25] . In a study by Shih et al.,  $\mathsf{P O N}1^{-/-}$    mice were unable to prevent oxidation of LDL and prone to atherosclerosis because their macrophages contained a high proportion of oxidized lipids  [24] . In a later study, the authors observed that double-knockout   $\bar{\mathsf{A p o E}^{-/-}}/\mathsf{P O N}1^{-/-}$    mice displayed greater at hero sclerotic burden compared to the   $\mathsf{A p o E^{-/-}/P O N1^{+/\bar{+}}}$    mice [26] . Furthermore, in other studies, mice with an over expressed PON1 gene were protected against atherosclerosis, irrespective of a wild type apoE or   $\mathsf{a p o E^{-/-}}$    genetic background  [25,27] . PON1 is mainly distributed in blood or liver but a recent study showed that PON1 was also expressed in VSMCs and the expression was downregulated in the formation of atheromatous plaques [28] . Combining above studies and our  ﬁ ndings that PON1 rs3735590 is associated with a clinical event (stroke) and a major pathological change underlying stroke (IMT), PON1 may protect against stroke

After   $24\textrm{h}$  incubation, luciferase activity was measured, and the EGFP value was used as an internal control. Data are presented as mean  $\pm\nobreakspace\mathsf{S D}$   of 3 experiments, and \* denotes a  $p$  - value  $<0.05$  .  

through reducing IMT and oxidative stress in lipoprotein s. To be noticed, we use an observation study design to investigate the relationship between PON1 genotype, IMT and stroke. Other intervention studies are warranted to provide another line of evidence to support our  ﬁ nding. In addition, PON1 may also mediate other mechanism to in ﬂ uence stroke risk, such as modulating homocysteine metabolism  [29] .  

Previous studies have linked 7 functional SNPs at PON1 to human diseases. These SNPs can in ﬂ uence PON1 expression levels or affect the catalytic activity of the PON1 enzyme. Two are exonic SNPs (L55M and Q192R)  [30,31] ; and the other 5 SNPs are located at the promoter region of PON1 (T-107C, C-126G, G-162A, G-824A, and C-907G)  [32,33] . Previous studies have also reported the association between PON1 functional SNPs and cardiovascular diseases in several populations. A meta-analysis of 11,212 cases and 12,786 controls con ﬁ rmed that the R-variant of the Q192R SNP was associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease  [34] . In other studies, PON1 polymorphisms were associated with ischemic stroke in Japanese  [35]  and Caucasian  [22]  populations, and with carotid IMT in African American and Caucasian populations  [36,37] . To the best of our knowledge, our study is the  ﬁ rst to identify that a miR-SNP at PON1 in ﬂ uences both stroke risk and IMT values. No previous investigation has evaluated the functional SNP rs3735590 at 3 0 UTR. We further validated the biological effects of this miR-SNP using in vitro experiments.  

The SNP rs3735590 is located in the 3 0 UTR that is complementary to the seed region of miR-616. The C to T substitution of this SNP leads to non complement ari ty between miR-616 and PON1 mRNA pairing. The risk C allele causes lower PON1 expression than the T allele. A recent study showed that the miRNA pro ﬁ les in HDL particles differed signi ﬁ cantly between familial hyper cho lesterolemia patients and normal participants  [38] . This study reported that miR-616 is one of the miRNAs carried by HDL particles in at hero sclerotic patients  [38] . Therefore, endogenous miR-616 might regulate PON1 expression in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.  

Our study design has strengths and limitations. The main strength was its relatively large sample size, which reduces type I and type II error rates. Using genetic study software for power estimation ( http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/  $\sim$  purcell/gpc/ ), our sample size provides a power of  $80\%$   for an OR of 1.40 and   $100\%$   for an OR of 1.80, with an alpha level of 0.05 for stroke. The mir-616 expression was observed in VSMCs during atherosclerosis process in two microarray studies  [39,40]  and our miRNA array experiment (see  Supplementary Table 4 ). However, there is no clear evidence how and through which tissue and process miR-616 and PON1 could affect the stroke risk. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism responsible for the effect of miR-616 and PON1 on stroke susceptibility. Finally, our analyzes did not address the effects of other SNPs of PON1. Several SNPs at the PON1 gene can reportedly in ﬂ uence PON1 expression. More studies to investigate the interaction between the functional SNPs of PON1 are, therefore, warranted.  

In summary, this study used bioinformatics analysis, an miRNA array, genetic association studies, and luciferase reporter assays to identify and validate the protective effect of minor allele T in miRSNP rs3735590 on the risk of ischemic stroke and carotid atherosclerosis. Through the knockdown effect of miR-616 on PON1, the risk C allele can in ﬂ uence PON1 expression to a greater extent than the T allele. Our study results emphasize the importance of investigation of SNPs located in miRNA target sites to increase understanding of ischemic stroke and atherosclerosis.
