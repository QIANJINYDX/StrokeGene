Summary.  Background:  Arterial thrombosis involves platelet aggregation and clot formation, yet little is known about the contribution of genetic variation in ﬁbrin-based hemostatic factors to arterial clotting risk. We hypothesized that common variation in 24 coagulation–bri no lysis genes would contribute to risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke (IS).  Methods:  We conducted a populationbased, case–control study. Subjects were hypertensive adults and post menopausal women 30–79 years of age, who sustained a ﬁrst MI   $(n\,=\,856)$   or IS   $(n\,=\,368)$  ) between 1995 and 2002, and controls matched on age, hypertension status, and calendar year   $(n\,=\,2689)$  ). We investigated the risk of MI and IS associated with (i) global variation within each gene as measured by common haplotypes and (ii) individual haplotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Sign i can ce was assessed using a 0.2 threshold of the false discovery rate  $q$  -value, which accounts for multiple testing.  Results:  After accounting for multiple testing, global genetic variation in factor (F) VIII was associated with IS risk. Two haplotypes in FVIII and one in FXIIIa1 were sign i cant ly associated with increased IS risk (all  $q$  -values   $<\,0.2$  ). A plasminogen gene SNP was associated with MI risk. All are new discoveries not previously reported. Another 24 tests had    $P$  -values   $<\,0.05$   and    $q$  -values   $>\ 0.2$   in MI and IS analyses, 23 of which are new and hypothesis generating.  Conclusions:  Apart from the association of FVIII variation with IS, we found little evidence that common variation in the 24 candidate ﬁbrin-based hemostasis genes strongly inﬂuences arterial thrombotic risk, but our results cannot rule out small eﬀects.

# Introduction  

Fibrin clot formation and platelet aggregation create arterial thrombi that impede circulation and can precipitate adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke (IS). Acquired risk factors for MI and IS have been extensively characterized, yet little is known about the contribution of genetic variation in hemostatic factors to arterial clotting risk. Genetic investigations of coagulation, anti coagulation, bri no ly tic, and anti bri no ly tic factors published to date have primarily investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes deﬁned by a few SNPs. Although individual study ﬁndings have often been inconsistent, meta-analyses of the data on factor (F) II G20210A, FV R509Q (Leiden), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) 4G/5G indicate that coronary disease and IS risks are increased by   $4–47\%$   [1–3]. Metaanalyses of data on several other variants in the clotting pathway (FVII G10976A, FXIIIa1 V34L,    $\upbeta$  -ﬁbrinogen G455A and C-148T) have suggested no association with either MI or IS. Findings for individual variants across other genes are limited and have not been included in metaanalyses [1–4].  

The aim of these analyses was to describe the association of common genetic variation in 24 ﬁbrin-based clotting candidate genes with ﬁrst-time MI and IS in hypertensive adults and post menopausal women. Our approach involved global testing of gene-wide variation for each of the 24 genes with MI risk and IS risk separately and exploration of haplotype and SNP contributions to risk.  

# Methods  

# Setting and design  

The setting for this observational study was Group Health (GH), a large integrated healthcare system in western Washington State. These analyses were part of a series of ongoing, population-based, case–control studies of MI, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous thrombosis, and atrial brillat ion [5–8]. For these analyses, we combined data from the study of MI and IS risk in adults with treated hypertension and the study of MI and IS risk in peri- and post menopausal women. This study was approved by the GH Human Subjects Review Committee and all study participants provided written informed consent.  

# Study population  

Subjects were pharmaceutical ly treated hypertensive men and women and peri- and post menopausal women 30–79 years of age who were GH members. Case subjects were GH members who suffered an incident MI or IS between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2002, and who were alive at the time of study recruitment. The date of the event served as an index date. Control subjects were a random sample of GH members that comprised a pool of control subjects shared by several case– control studies conducted at GH [5–8]. Control subjects were also GH members and were frequency matched by age (within decade), sex, treated hypertension status, and calendar-year of ident i cation to MI cases, the largest case group. Control subjects included in this analysis had no prior history of MI or IS and their index date was a randomly chosen date within the calendar year from which they were selected as a control.  

Case subjects were screened using ICD-9 codes from GH and non-GH hospitalizations. Trained medical record abstractors reviewed the medical records of all potential cases to verify the event. For MI, ver i cation was based on symptoms, electrocardiogram ﬁndings, enzyme levels, and physician diagnosis and treatment. For IS, ver i cation required the rapid onset of a neurologic deﬁcit that persisted for at least  $24\mathrm{~h~}$   or evidence of infarction on brain imaging studies or at surgery [5,9]. We excluded case subjects whose MI or stroke was a complication of a procedure or surgery.  

Measures  

Genetic variation The 24 candidate genes were selected    $a$  priori  based on their role in regulating hemostasis. Spec i call y, the genes code for proteins affecting coagulation (FII, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, FXII, FXIIIa1, and FXIIIb;    $\propto-$  ,

  $\upbeta-$  , and    $\gamma$  -ﬁbrinogen; and tissue factor), anti coagulation

 (anti thro mb in, proteins C and S, endo the li al protein C receptor, thr ombo mod ul in, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor), bri no lysis [plasminogen, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)], and anti bri no lysis [PAI-1 and thrombin act iv a table bri no lysis inhibitor (TAFI)]. All 24 genes were sequenced by the Seattle Program for Genomic Applications (PGA) using DNA obtained from a panel of 24 African-Americans and 23 European-Americans. Genes were sequenced starting  $2.5~\mathrm{kb}$   upstream of the start of transcription and extending   $1.5~\mathrm{kb}$   beyond the end of transcription. For large genes, sequencing was limited to exons and promoter regions. Details can be found at http://pga.gs.washington.edu/.  

Among variants with a minor allele frequency of   $5\%$   or greater in the PGA panel, ldSelect (ldSelect version 1.0, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA) was used to identify maximally informative sets of SNPs to describe genetic variation using linkage d is equilibrium [10]. This process was carried out separately for European- and African-American sequence data. From within ancestry-stratiﬁed SNP sets, a single variant was hierarchically chosen based on the following priorities: non-synonymous, untranslated regions (  $.5^{\prime}$   or 3 ¢ ), promoter, intron, and synonymous. In addition, we identiﬁed non-synonymous SNPs that were not already selected and that had a minor allele frequency of   $4\%$   or greater in either racial group.  

Blood collection and genotyping A blood sample was collected from all consenting subjects and DNA was extracted from white blood cells using standard procedures. Genotyping '   was performed by Illumina (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, ' USA) with a GoldenGate custom panel using BeadArray '   technology. Illumina personnel were blinded to case–control status. The ﬁnal list of SNPs in the 24 genes numbered 306, of ' which 280 were successfully genotyped on the Illumina platform. Among the 280 successful SNPs,   $99.94\%$   of nucleotide pairs were successfully called. Agreement between '   Illumina results and results from a substudy of 1472 subjects that used restriction fragment length polymorphism technology to genotype two variants (FV Leiden and FII G20210A) was excellent   $\mathrm{\tt(kappa}\,=\,0.99$   and 1.00, respectively).  

Haplotype construction and SNP selection Phased haplotypes were estimated for each gene using PHASE software ( PHASE  version 2.0, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA), which computes probabilities for each haplotype pair consistent with the observed data [11]. When ambiguous haplotypes were encountered, multiple, probability-weighted haplotype pairs were created. We combined haplotypes with a frequency of less than   $2\%$   in control and case populations into a single   other   haplotype. We split the FV gene into two sections below a point of high recombination (PGA site 36090) to minimize the number of haplotypes below the   $2\%$   threshold. Halves were analyzed separately.  

From among the 280 SNPs that were genotyped in the study population, 109 SNPs were found to be either extremely rare or non-varying, or tightly linked   $(r^{2}\ge0.8)$   with another SNP. Many of these low-informative SNPs were selected from African-American bins. These variants were excluded from SNP analyses leaving 171 SNPs characterizing genetic variation across the 24 candidate genes. RS numbers, PGA identiﬁers, and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium    $P$  -values for all SNPs are listed in Table S1 of the Supplementary material.  

Demographic and clinical information Demographic and health-status information was obtained by review of the entire GH ambulatory medical record up to the index date. Information was collected on treated hypertension and diabetes, menopausal and smoking status, and history of coronary heart disease (angina or coronary re vascular iz ation), transient ischemic attack, and chronic heart failure. Clinical measures were also collected and included most recent weight and height, blood pressure, and lipid measures. Information on race, ancestry, and tobacco use was collected from the participant by telephone interview.  

# Statistical Analyses  

Haplotype and SNP models For each gene, weighted logistic regression was used to estimate haplotype associations. To express haplotype uncertainty, we used probability weights produced by PHASE and robust  sandwich   errors, clustered by subject [12]. The number of copies of each haplotype (0, 1, or 2) was used as the predictor, and the most common haplotype in the gene was used as the reference level and was not included in the model. The estimates were adjusted for race, and matching variables sex, age, index year and hypertension. For each haplotype, this model provides an estimate of the risk associated with each additional copy of the speciﬁed haplotype compared with an additional copy of the reference haplotype. This assumes an additive model of inheritance where each additional allele modiﬁes risk similarly. These are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with  $95\%$   CIs. As a global test of variation within each gene, we compared the haplotype model that characterized all common variation within the gene with a model that included no haplotype information using a Wald test. Formally, this tests the null hypothesis that all gene-wide variants have an OR equal to 1. In addition, for each SNP, unweighted logistic regression models were used to estimate the association with MI and stroke risk while adjusting for race and matching variables. A single predictor coded 0, 1, or 2 (representing the number of copies of the minor allele) was created for each SNP, giving estimates of the OR associated with each additional copy of the minor allele. For the two X-linked genes, FVIII and FIX, males were coded 0 or 1 for haplotype and SNPs and females were coded 0, 0.5, and 1 to express the uncertainty of which allele was inﬂuential while maintaining a single-allele risk estimate. Models were not adjusted for other risk factors besides age, sex, and race, because acquired characteristics do not generally confound genetic associations.  

Multiple testing and false discovery rate analysis Twentyﬁve global gene association tests were performed on the 24 candidate genes (FV gene was split into two parts). In the absence of a true association for any gene, we would expect a  $P_{-}$  -value of less than 0.05 for at least one of the 25 gene-wide association tests. A total of 180 haplotypes and 171 SNPs were tested for individual associations across the 24 genes. By chance alone, we would expect    $P$  -values of less than 0.05 in nine of the haplotype-speciﬁc tests and in at least nine of the SNP-speciﬁc tests.  

To assist in the interpretation of    $P$  -values given the number of statistical tests performed, false discovery rate (FDR)    $q$  - values were calculated separately for gene-wide, haplotype and SNP analyses [13]. Rather than expressing the probability of one false positive result among all tests, the    $q$  -value estimates the proportion of results declared interesting that are actually false. A    $q$  -value threshold of 0.2 was selected to separate false discoveries from true discoveries in this candidate-gene investigation. A lower threshold is often used in genome-wide association studies, which does not use prior information to select candidate genes [14].  

Interesting haplotype or SNP variants We examined 24 genes, and so can practically report measures of global association for each gene. However, with 180 haplotypes and 171 SNPs to assess, we summarized the more interesting ﬁndings. After computing    $P\cdot$  -values and    $q$  -values for all haplotypes and SNPs separately for each outcome, we identiﬁed and listed haplotypes and SNPs with    $P$  -values less than 0.05 in the models described above. In genes where the listed haplotype effect was primarily attributable to a single SNP, we listed the SNP and de-listed the haplotype to avoid redundancy of information. We have used a similar approach to report ﬁndings on these 24 hemostatic genes and venous thrombosis in post menopausal women [15].  

# Results  

Included in the analyses were  $856\;\mathrm{GHz}$   members who suffered an incident MI (365 in hypertensive men, 242 in hypertensive women, and 249 in non-hypertensive women) and 368 who suffered an incident IS (114 in hypertensive men, 150 in hypertensive women, and 104 in non-hypertensive women) between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2002, and who provided a blood sample. Controls were without a history of MI or IS and numbered 2689 (1128 hypertensive men, 847 hypertensive women, and 714 non-hypertensive women). Characteristics of the two case groups and controls are listed in Table 1. The study population was largely of European ancestry and the average age ranged from 65 to 68 years for case and control groups. Cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, elevated systolic blood pressure, and treated hyper lipid emi a, were more common in cases than in controls.  

# Gene associations  

Table 2 provides a summary of the 24 candidate clottingrelated genes investigated and their global association with MI and IS risk. The proportion of all haplotypes with an incidence of  $2\%$   or less was small with  $90\%$   of alleles assigned a unique haplotype in 20 genes and nearly   $80\%$   in the remaining four

genes. For global tests of genetic relation to MI, there was no gene with a    $q$  -value less than 0.2 and only one gene with a    $P_{-}$  - value less than 0.05 (plasminogen). For global tests in relation to IS, only the FVIII gene had a  $q$  -value less than 0.2. No other gene had a    $P$  -value less than 0.05.  

# Haplotype and SNP associations  

Tables S2–S26 in the Supplementary material present the basic analyses that were conducted for MI and IS outcomes for each gene. We present Table 3, the FV table, as an example. Table 3 provides a matrix of nucleotides that summarize the association between SNP variation and haplotypes within the upper portion of the FV gene. Shaded cells identify the minor allele. Haplotype- and SNP-speciﬁc ORs,  $95\%$   CIs, and    $P$  -values are presented. For MI, we found that one of the 10 haplotypes was associated with an increased risk (haplotype 9: OR 1.8;  $95\%$   CI 1.2–2.7) compared with the reference haplotype. The MI highrisk haplotype was marked by SNP PGA-46058 (non-synonymous substitution of   $\mathrm{T}$   to S at amino acid 915, rs9332695),

which was also associated with MI risk (OR 1.7;  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}~1.2-$  2.6). The minor allele frequency of the haplotype and SNP were identical in controls   $(1.3\%)$  . For IS, the FV Leiden variant was associated with risk (OR 1.5;  $95\%\,\mathrm{CI}\,1.0{-}2.3)$   yet the haplotype marked by this variant (haplotype 8) was not in part because reference groups were not the same for the two comparisons. Minor allele frequency of the variant and haplotype were identical in controls   $(2.3\%)$  .  

A total of 180 haplotypes were tested across the 24 candidate genes. For MI, seven   $(3.9\%)$   of the 180 tests had  $P_{-}$  -values less than 0.05, which represents two fewer than the nine that would have been expected by chance alone at the  $\propto$  -level of 0.05. For IS, eight  $(4.4\%)$   of the 180 tests had  $P$  -values less than 0.05. The seven MI and the eight IS risk haplotypes were not the same. A total of 171 SNPs were tested across 24 candidate genes. For MI, ﬁve  $(2.9\%)$  ) of the 171 tests had    $P_{-}$  -values less than 0.05. For IS, nine   $(5.3\%)$   of the 171 tests had    $P$  -values less than 0.05. None of the MI and IS risk SNPs was the same. Among all haplotype and SNP associations tested, only four had FDR  $q$  - values less than 0.2. Three were associated with IS risk: FVIII haplotype 2 (OR 2.0;   $95\%$   CI 1.3–2.9;    $q$  -value 0.0630); FVIII  other   haplotype (OR 2.8;  $95\%$   CI 1.4–5.6;    $q$  -value 0.1860); and FXIIIa haplotype 11 (OR 1.8;   $95\%$   CI 1.3–2.6;    $q$  -value 0.0630). One was associated with MI risk: plasminogen PGA18114 (rs3823055; OR 1.2;   $95\%$   CI 1.1–1.4;    $q$  -value 0.1710). Table 4 lists the summary of these ﬁndings. When analyses were conducted separately among subjects with hypertension and among women, respectively, risk estimates were similar and not statistically different: FVIII haplotype 2 for IS, 1.7 vs. 2.2; FVIII   other   haplotype for IS, 2.4 vs. 2.1; FXIIIa1 haplotype 11 for IS, 1.9 vs. 1.6; plasminogen PGA-18114 for MI, 1.3 vs. 1.2.  

# Comment  

This investigation assessed the risk of arterial clotting associated with common genetic variation in 24 candidate coagulation, anti coagulation, bri no lysis, and anti bri no lysis genes. Factor VIII was globally associated with IS risk and no gene was globally associated with MI risk. Three haplotypes, two in FVIII and one in FXIIIa1, were sign i cant ly associated with a  $96\%$  ,  $181\%$  , and  $81\%$   increase in IS risk, respectively (all FDR

# Ischemic stroke  

Haplotype 2 and the   other   haplotype of FVIII were among three FVIII SNPs that were associated with an increased risk of IS. None of these associations has been previously reported. As described in Table S7, FVIII haplotype 2 is marked (but not exclusively) by the minor allele of two of the three SNPs also associated with IS risk: PGA-95826 (rs1800291), a   $\mathrm{D}$   to E amino-acid substitution at position 1260; and PGA-55941 (rs1936645), an intronic nucleotide substitution in tight LD with D1260E   $(r^{2}\,=\,0.73)$  . The combined   other   haplotype was composed of 185 rare haplotypes and included all minor alleles for the M2257V substitution (PGA-165293, rs1800297) that was private to African-Americans and that was associated with a non-signiﬁcant elevated risk in our data (OR 2.6;   $95\%$   CI 0.9–7.1). Haplotype 11 of FXIIIa1 was associated with an increased risk of IS and carries minor alleles for V35L and P565L. Neither amino acid substitution was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in IS in our data, similar to null reports from a meta-analysis [2]. The FV Leiden variant, which was associated with a   $53\%$   increase in risk in our data, replicates ﬁndings from a recent meta-analysis that found a   $33\%$   increase in IS [2]. PAI-1 haplotype 8, associated with a  $54\%$   increase in IS risk, is marked by the minor alleles of PGA-664 (rs2227631) and PGA-12219 (rs11178) and this ﬁnding appears to be new. The PGA-664 variant is in strong LD   $(r^{2}\,=\,0.92)$   with the  $\mathbf{G}$  insertion (PGA-837 4G/5G), which has been associated with a  $47\%$   increase in IS risk in a recessive risk model that combined data from ﬁve studies [2]. The tag SNP for   $4\mathrm{G}/5\mathrm{G}$   was not associated with risk in our additive model and a  post hoc exploration of the recessive model did not yield signiﬁcant ﬁndings (OR 1.2;  $95\%$   CI 0.9–1.6). The IS associations with FX, FXI,    $\gamma$  -ﬁbrinogen, protein C receptor, plasminogen, and tPA have not been reported in the literature and serve as hypothesis-generating ﬁndings.  

# Limitations  

The PGA-18114 SNP in plasminogen was associated with a  $21\%$   increase in risk and this ﬁnding has not been reported previously. The 10 other associations with MI listed in Table 4 had a    $q$  -value less than 0.2. Of those with    $P\cdot$  -values less than 0.05, variants in FV, FIX, FX, FXI, tissue factor, protein C receptor, and plasminogen genes have not been previously reported to be associated with MI risk. Two of these variants were non-synonymous substitutions: FV T915S and plasminogen D472N. Two haplotypes in tissue factor, 2 and 6, were associated with increased MI risk. Haplotype 6 includes the minor allele by PGA-599 (rs958587), which, along with another promoter variant in tight LD, has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [16,17]. The PGA-599 was not associated with MI risk in our data. Associations with both haplotypes appear to be new ﬁndings.  

Factor V Leiden was not associated with MI risk in our data (OR 1.0;  $95\%$   CI 0.7–1.5), yet our CI overlaps the risk estimate from a recent meta-analysis [1]. Similarly, our CIs for FII 20210A (OR 1.4;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}~0.9–2.1)$  ) or the PAI-1  $4\mathrm{G}/5\mathrm{G}$   tag SNP (OR 1.0;  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}~0.9–1.1)$  ) overlapped estimates of   $25\%$  and  $4\%$   increases in MI risk, respectively, reported in the metaanalysis [1]. We did not ﬁnd FXIIIa1 V35L (also reported as V34L) to be associated with decreased risk in additive (OR 0.9;  $95\%$   CI 0.8–1.1) or  post hoc  recessive models (OR 0.9;  $95\%$   CI 0.7–1.3) and reports for this variant have been inconsistent [2]. We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant associations between FVII, FVIII, FXII, and thr ombo mod ul in variants and MI risk, unlike previous reports, some of which have been inconsistent [1,18– 27]. The A147T variant in TAFI has been inconsistently associated with coronary disease risk and this variant was not identiﬁed by the PGA, so it was not genotyped in our data [28,29].  

# Interpretation of the FDR statistic in candidate gene studies  

We used a 0.2 threshold for the    $q$  -value to guide the interpretation of gene-, haplotype-, and SNP-level ﬁndings in this candidate gene study. This threshold identiﬁed one signiﬁcant global gene association among 50 tests performed (two outcomes  $\times\,25$  genes), three signiﬁcant haplotype associations among the 360 performed   $(2\times180)$  , and one signiﬁcant SNP among the 342 tests performed   $(2\times171)$  . By design,   $20\%$   of these discoveries are likely to be false. Without the application of the false discovery rate, two of the global gene tests and 28 of the haplotype and SNP tests would have been considered signiﬁcant based on a    $P$  -value of less than 0.05. We did not exclude from analyses three variants (FV Leiden, FII 20210A, and PAI-1   $4\mathrm{G}/5\mathrm{G})$   that were associated with MI and IS risk in recent meta-analyses [1,2]. Exclusion of these SNPs and the haplotypes that they mark from analyses would have minor effects on FDR  $q$  -values.  

Our comprehensive approach to risk evaluation among candidate genes at whole-gene, haplotype, and SNP levels for two arterial thrombotic outcomes inherently involved multiple tests. To better characterize the risk of reporting false positive associations, we provided FDR    $q$  -values and a suggested    $q$  - value threshold. We limited our investigation to the main effects of genes and did not explore gene–gene interactions or gene–environment interactions. Population association studies such as ours are prone to the potential confounding effects of population substructure. We have adjusted for self-reported race in all analyses but the population of African-Americans in our study was too small to meaningfully address risk differences by race. As our study had only candidate genes, methods of population substructure estimation such as STRUCTURE, or   genomic control   of population strat i cation could not be applied [30,31]. For large genes, such as FVIII, only portions of the gene had been sequenced for variation, which limits the amount of variation we were able to capture with our approach. Most non-sequenced gene sections were introns, however. With the exception of FX, our approach used the most common haplotype as the reference in haplotype analyses, and other approaches are possible that would lead to different risk estimates and    $P$  -values. Although we had adequate statistical power to detect MI risks as small as 1.4 for a variant with a incidence of   $10\%$  , our power was more limited for IS, where we could detect a risk as small as 1.9 for a variant with the same incidence. The sample size of our study limited our ability to detect risks in the 1.2–1.5 range, especially for IS outcomes. Although we adjusted for multiple testing, these analyses did not involve replication in another population, so any new ﬁndings we have reported need this additional level of interrogation before true associations are established. All subjects in these analyses were survivors of their incident event and ﬁndings cannot be generalized to fatal events, which may be more th rom bogen ic and associated more strongly with genetic risk. Results also cannot be generalized to nonhypertensive men and those who suffered an event before the age of 30 or after 79.  

This study investigated the risk of arterial thrombosis associated with common variation in 24 key genes in ﬁbrinbased clotting pathways. After accounting for false discoveries, only FVIII was associated with gene-wide global risk and this was for IS exclusively. Three haplotypes, two in FVIII and one in FXIIIa1, were sign i cant ly associated with IS risk. A SNP in the plasminogen gene was associated with MI risk. All were new discoveries that need replication in other populations and as well as follow-up functional investigations to determine their impact on factor plasma levels and activity. Another 24 associations had    $P_{-}$  -values less than 0.05 and an FDR    $q$  -value greater than 0.2. One of these associations has been previously reported and our study serves as a replication; the remaining 24 are new and hypothesis generating and need replication in other study populations. Apart from the association of FVIII variation with IS, we found little evidence that genetic variation in ﬁbrin-based hemostatic factors strongly inﬂuences arterial thrombotic risk, but our results cannot rule out the presence of small effects.
