Cerebral infarction (CI) is a complex multi factorial disorder that is thought to result from the interaction of various environmental factors and an individual’s genetic make-up, including genes associated with platelet activation. In order to clarify whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the prost a cyclin receptor (IP) gene affects platelet activation in ischemic stroke, we investigated the relationship between platelet function and genetic polymorphism of the coding sequence of the IP gene in 64 Japanese patients with CI and 54 healthy subjects. We determined the entire nucleotide sequence of the IP gene in healthy Japanese subjects, and found that an adenine (A) to cytosine (C) substitution at base 984 (A984C) in exon 3 is the most frequent SNP. Using ﬂow cytometry, the power-transformed mean percentage of PAC-1- positive platelets,  $[\mathsf{P A C}_{-1}]^{1/3}$  , was sign i cant ly higher in healthy subjects with the  ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotype than in healthy subjects with the A/A genotype   $(p\leqslant0.05)$  , although there was no signiﬁcant difference in patients with CI between these two genotypes. Furthermore, we genotyped 158 control patients and 106 patients with CI. The homozygous   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotype was more frequently found in the CI group   $(46.2\%)$   than in the healthy control group (  $17.1\%$  ;  $p<0.001$  ). The present report is the ﬁrst to show an association between the A984C polymorphism of the IP gene and platelet activation in Japanese subjects. This polymorphism may be clinically signiﬁcant in disorders in which prost a cyclin plays a key role, such as CI.

Whole-blood three-color ﬂow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies such as MoAb-CD62P and PAC-1 is a powerful tool for assessment of platelet activation,   and we have already reported that platelet activation and hyper ag greg ability are frequently observed in patients with CI.   The hIP gene, localized on human chromosome 19q13,   is considered to be a candidate gene for involvement in cardiovascular diseases, including CAD and stroke.   In addition, an experimental study using IP-deﬁcient mice has shown that a prost a cyclin analogue is unable to inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation,   suggesting that SNPs of the hIP gene may inﬂuence the occurrence of thrombotic events. In order to clarify whether hIP gene SNPs affect platelet activation in ischemic stroke, we investigated the relationship between platelet function and hIP gene SNPs in Japanese patients with CI and healthy subjects using ﬂow cytometry.  

# 1. Introduction  

Platelet activation and aggregation play key roles in the process of arterial thrombosis.   The mechanism by which platelet hyperag greg ability arises is unclear, but both genetic and environmental factors are likely involved. Cerebral infarction (CI) and coronary artery disease (CAD) are also complex multi factorial disorders that are thought to result from interaction between an individual’s genetic make-up and various environmental factors.   Recent genetic epidemiology investigations have revealed that some genetic variations, including polymorphisms in apo lipoprotein   $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}}^{8,9}$    and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa,   increase the risk for CAD. Prostacyclin inhibits platelet aggregation, smooth muscle cell proliferation and va so constriction, counteracting thromboxane A2 (TXA2) activity.   These actions are mediated through the human prostacyclin receptor (hIP). Since an imbalance of thrombotic and antithrombotic factors may promote thrombus formation, we focused here on the inﬂuence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the prost a cyclin receptor (IP) gene on a the roth rom bot ic events.  

# 2. Subjects and methods  

# 2.1. Subjects  

The clinical characteristics of the apparently healthy control subjects and the patients with CI are summarized in  Table 1 . The  

Table 1 Characteristics of the study participants in the control and cerebral infarction (CI) groups 
![](images/da79b562cee8d3ef64b2cf2fc92f41c005900852f9484aae45c80bc4067b5bb5.jpg)  
Age is shown as mean  $\pm\,\mathsf{S D}$  . Differences in clinical data between CI and control were analyzed by ANOVA or chi-square test. The criterion of statistical sign i can ce was  $p<0.05$  .  ${\mathsf{C I}}=$  conﬁdence interval,  $\mathrm{SD}=$   standard deviation.  

study population consisted of 158 apparently healthy control subjects and 106 patients with CI. The patients with CI were outpatients and inpatients of Tokai University Hospital (from 2004 to 2008), who had given informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Human Studies Committee at Tokai University. Informed consent was also obtained from the healthy control subjects. The mean age   $(\pm\mathrm{SD})$   was  $43\pm18$   in the control group and   $59\pm10$   years in the CI group. The CI group consisted of patients with MRI-conﬁrmed CI in the chronic stage (1 month to 10 years after onset). Of the 106 patients in the CI group, 71 had hypertension, 72 had dys lipid emi a, and 23 had diabetes mellitus.  

The control subjects were selected from apparently healthy volunteers who had no history of ischemic cerebral disease, myocardial infarction, or diabetes mellitus. Control subjects also had fewer risk factors (nine subjects had hypertension and three subjects had dys lipid emi a). Eventually, 158 apparently healthy control subjects were selected and this group had a younger mean age (±SD) than the 106 patients in the CI group (  $.43\pm18$  vs  $59\pm10$   years old, respectively;  $p<0.001$  ). Because healthy controls have fewer risk factors, we did not perform MRI on subjects in the control group.  

Of the 158 healthy subjects and 106 patients with CI, only 54 apparently healthy controls (  $54\pm8$   years) and 64 patients with CI  $.61\pm12$   years), who provided informed consent for additional testing, were evaluated for platelet activation. These healthy controls were also sign i cant ly younger than patients with CI   $(p<0.01)$  . We determined the hIP genotype of patients at base pair 984, where the base substitution of adenine (A) with cytosine (C) is the most common SNP (A984C). The mean   ${\tt a g e s\pm S D}$   of subjects in the control group with the  ${\mathsf{A}}/{\mathsf{A}},\,{\mathsf{A}}/{\mathsf{C}}$  , and   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotypes were  $55\pm9$   years,   $52\pm8$   years, and   $58\pm14$   years, respectively. The mean  ${\mathsf{a g e s\pm S D}}$   of patients in the CI group with the  ${\mathsf{A}}/{\mathsf{A}},{\mathsf{A}}/{\mathsf{C}}$  , and  ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotypes were  $67\pm4$   years,   $58\pm16$   years, and   $61\pm7$   years, respectively. Patients with CI and card i oem boli c stroke were excluded from the study. Of the patients with CI, all 26 of those who had at hero thrombosis (AT) and 20 of 38 who had lacunar infarction (LA) were given sodium ozagrel. Intravenous infusion of sodium ozagrel   $(80\,\mathrm{mg/day})$   was done twice a day for 2 weeks. However, considering the possible inﬂuence on platelet activation, blood samples from these patients were taken immediately before the next ozagrel treatment (more than 8 hours after the previous ozagrel treatment). In 18 patients with LA, blood samples were taken during an anti-platelet medication-free period of at least 7 days before these patients were scheduled for gastric endoscopy in the Health-Check program.  

# 2.2. Sample preparation  

Venous blood was collected around 10:00 am under non-fasting conditions in all subjects. The ﬁrst   $2\,\mathrm{mL}$   of blood was discarded, and then  $4.5\,\mathrm{mL}$   was collected slowly into a plastic syringe ﬁtted with a 21 gauge needle (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) and containing  $0.5\;\mathrm{mL}$   of  $3.13\%$   sodium citrate.  

# 2.3. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis  

The DNA for analysis of polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR–RFLP) was extracted from the whole blood of patients with CI and healthy controls using the ReadyAmp TM   Genomic DNA Pur i cation System (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA) and ampliﬁed by PCR.  

To assess the A984C polymorphism in exon 3 of the hIP gene by Eco 81I  restriction fragment length polymorphism, we used sense primer   $5^{\prime}$  -CTT CAT CCT TTT CCG CAA GGC T $.3^{\prime}$    and antisense primer   $5^{\prime}$  -TCA CAG GGT CAG CTT GAA ATG T-3 0 , which were designed from the genomic sequence of the prost a cyclin receptor gene (PTGIR, GenBank accession number NM000960). The PCR conditions were initial de natura tion at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of   $95~^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 30 seconds,   $64\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 seconds, and  $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 1 minute, and a ﬁnal extension at   $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 5 minutes. The PCR product was digested with  Eco 81I  and the digest was separated on a  $10\%$   polya cry l amide gel.  

# 2.4. Measurement of platelet activation using ﬂow cytometry  

Blood in   $2.5~\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   aliquots was placed in micro centrifuge tubes containing   $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of ﬂuorescein is ot hio cyan ate (FITC)-conjugated PAC-1 (monoclonal antibody to ﬁbrinogen receptors, Becton Dickinson Bioscience s, San Jose, CA, USA),   $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of ph y coe ry thr in (PE)-conjugated MoAb-CD62P (monoclonal antibody to P-selectin, Becton Dickinson Bioscience s), and   $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of peridinin chlorophyll protein (per CP)-conjugated MoAb-CD61 (monoclonal antibody to GP IIIa, Becton Dickinson Bioscience s) to identify platelets.   To assess the extent of nonspeciﬁc protein binding to platelets, 0.62  $\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of isotype control was added instead of PE-conjugated MoAbCD62P. To demonstrate speciﬁc PAC-1 binding, we used one tube with   $10~\mathrm{~\textmuL~}$   of   $5\,\mathrm{mg/mL}$   arginine–glycine–aspartic acid–serine (RGDS; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) solution in the staining mixture. The reaction mixture was gently stirred without vortexing, followed by incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, platelets were ﬁxed in  $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of cold   $1\%$  para formaldehyde.  

The samples were analyzed with a FAC S Calibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Bioscience s), using standard   $488\;\mathrm{nm}$   excitation. Activation-dependent antibody binding was expressed as the percentage of platelets positive for the antibody. Antibody-positive cells were deﬁned as those platelets with a u or esc en ce intensity of  $>99.0\%$   of platelets determined in the presence of isotype IgG or ﬁbrinogen receptor-blocking tetra peptide, RGDS, as a negative control. The total platelet populations were displayed, including any light scatter gated sub populations, as two-color dot plots.  

# 2.5. Statistical analysis  

Statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Allele frequencies were calculated from the genotypes of all subjects. The overall distribution of alleles was analyzed with the Chi-squared test. The one-third power transformation of the percentage of PAC-1-positive platelets   $([{\mathsf{P A C}}\!\!-\!\!1]^{1/3})$   and logarithmic transformation of the percentage of CD62P-positive platelets (log[CD62P]) were taken to achieve normal distributions, and the results were then analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. A    $p$   value of   ${<}0.05$   was considered signiﬁcant.  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. Genotype study  

To conﬁrm variations in the coding sequence of the IP receptor gene, we sequenced the whole IP gene in 10 healthy subjects to identify the most frequent SNPs, which are shown in  Fig. 1 . Using PCR–RFLP, we examined the SNP in which adenine was substituted for cytosine at nucleotide 984. The A-type allele is digested by  Eco  $81I$   into 109 bp and 201 bp fragments, whereas the C-type allele lacks the  Eco 81I  site and yields a 310 bp band .  This nucleotide change does not change the amino acid encoded by codon 328 in exon 3 of the prost a cyclin receptor gene ( Fig. 2 ). The other two SNPs identiﬁed were located in intron 2   $\mathsf{\dot{C}C}/\mathsf{G}$   and  ${\mathsf{G}}/{\mathsf{C}}$  ;  Fig. 1 ).  

# 3.2. Measurements of platelet activation  

To assess platelet activation, we measured samples from control subjects and patients with CI using ﬂow cytometry. Informed consent was received from 54 control subjects and 64 patients with CI for the purpose of measuring of platelet activation.  

The PAC-1-positive platelet rate   $(\%)$   and MoAb-CD62P-positive platelet rate  $(\%)$   did not exhibit normal distributions. However, the empirical cumulative distribution of the   $[\mathsf{P A C}_{-1}]^{1/3}$  -transformed values was smooth and symmetrical, indicating that the PAC-1-positive platelet rate in this population approximated the one-third power normal distribution. In the control group, the mean percentages  $\pm\,S\mathsf{D}$   of   $\mathsf{[P A C-1]}^{1/3}$    were sign i cant ly higher in samples from subjects with the  ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotype   $(2.30\pm0.69)$   than in samples from subjects with the  $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{A}$   genotype   $'1.62\pm0.69$  ;  $\mathtt{p}\leqslant$  0.05;  Fig. 3 a). The mean percentages  $\pm\,S\mathsf{D}$   of   $\mathrm{[PAC-}1]^{1/3}$    were not sign i cant ly different between  $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{A}$   and  $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C}$     $'1.85\pm0.57)$   samples or between   $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C}$   and   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   samples from control subjects.  

In the case of CD62P, the empirical cumulative distribution of the logarithmic ally transformed values of 54 control subjects was smooth and symmetrical, indicating that the MoAb-CD62Ppositive platelet rate in this population approximated a logarithmically normal distribution. The mean percentages  $\pm\,S\mathsf{D}$  of log[CD62P] were not sign i cant ly different among samples from patients with the   $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{A}$     $(0.22\pm1.11)$  ,   $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C}$     $(0.38\pm1.22)\$   and   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   $(0.75\pm1.36)$   genotypes ( Fig. 4 a).  

For samples from patients with CI, the mean percentages  $\pm\,S\mathsf{D}$  of  $\mathrm{[PAC-}1\bar{]}^{1/3}$  were not sign i cant ly different among A/A

  $(2.40\pm0.83)$  ,   $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C}$     $(2.92\pm0.87)$   and   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$     $(2.80\pm0.70)\$   samples

 ( Fig. 3 b). In addition, the mean values  $\pm\,S\mathsf{D}$   of log[CD62P] were not sign i cant ly different among samples from patients with the

The A984C substitution causes a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) when DNA is digested with the restriction enzyme  $E c o\,\,81I$  , and this RFLP was used to determine genotypes. When DNA is digested with  Eco 81I  and separated by gel electrophoresis, the  $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{A}$   genotype shows two bands of 109 bp and 201 bp. The  $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C}$   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotype shows a single band of 310 bp.

The mean percentages of log[MoAbCD62P]-positive platelets were not sign i cant ly different among subjects with the adenine/adenine (A/A), adenine/cytosine   $(\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C})$   and cytosine/cytosine (C/C) genotypes for either healthy subjects or patients with CI.

Furthermore, the rates of   $[\mathsf{P A C}_{-1}]^{1/3}$    positivity in patients with CI who had LA or AT were  $2.67\pm0.77$   and  $2.89\pm0.83$   (mean  $\pm\,\mathrm{SD}.$  ), respectively. The mean percentages of PAC-1-positive platelets in patients with LA and AT were not statistically sign i cant ly different. The average expression levels of CD62P (log[CD62P]) in the LA and AT patients were  $1.10\pm1.35$   and   $1.46\pm1.27$  , respectively.  

3.3. Genotype distribution in control subjects and patients with CI  

We genotyped 158 healthy subject and 106 patients with CI, as summarized in  Table 2 . The frequencies of the A/A,   ${\mathsf{A}}/{\mathsf{C}},$  , and   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$  genotypes in the control group were   $37.3\%$   (59 subjects),   $45.6\%$  (72 subjects), and   $17.1\%$   (27 subjects), respectively. The frequencies of the A/A,   $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C}$  , and   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotypes in the CI group were  $12.3\%$   (13 patients),   $41.5\%$   (44 patients), and   $46.2\%$   (49 patients), respectively. The difference between the CI and the control groups

 $p$   values were determined by chi-square test. The criterion of statistical sign i can ce was  $p<0.05$  .  $\mathsf{A}=$   adenosine,   $C=$   cytosine,   $\mathrm{SD}=$   standard deviation, LA  $=$   lacunar infarction,  $\mathsf{A T}=$   at hero thrombosis.  

was signiﬁcant   $\left.p<0.001\right>$  ). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the distribution of genotypes between males and females ( Table 3 ). Within the CI group, the frequencies of the   $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{A},\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C}$   and   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotypes in the LA subgroup were  $15.3\%$   (nine patients),   $40.7\%$   (24 patients), and   $44.1\%$   (26 patients), respectively ( Table 2 ). In the AT subgroup, the frequencies of the   $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{A},\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C}$  , and  ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotypes were

  $8.5\%$   (four patients),   $44.4\%$   (20 patients), and   $48.9\%$   (23 patients)

 ( Table 2 ). The distributions of genotypes were not sign i cant ly different between the LA and AT subtypes of CI.  

The clinical characteristics of patients who participated in the platelet activation measurements are summarized in  Table 3 . The frequencies of the  $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{A},\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{C}$  , and   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotypes in the control group were   $25.9\%$   (14 subjects),   $55.5\%$   (30 subjects), and   $18.5\%$   (10 subjects), respectively. The corresponding genotype frequencies in the CI group were   $20.3\%$   (13 patients),   $34.4\%$   (22 patients), and  $45.3\%$   (29 patients), respectively. The difference in genotype frequencies between the CI and the control groups is signiﬁcant  $(p<0.001)$  . Furthermore, there was no signiﬁcant age or sex dependence in the distributions of genotypes in the control group or the CI group.  

# 4. Discussion  

Multiple pathways lead to platelet activation, including those stimulated by collagen, ADP, TXA2, epinephrine, serotonin and thrombin.   In contrast, only prost a cyclin is known as a potent inhibitor of platelet activation. Prost a cyclin activates hIP, which is a G-protein-coupled receptor, and stimulates membrane-bound adenylate cyclase to generate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which leads to inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation.  

IP knockout mice show increased thrombosis,   intimal hyperplasia and restenosis,   and reduced in amma tory and pain responses.   Furthermore, Murata et al.   have reported that a prost a cyclin analog is unable to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation in IP-deﬁcient mice, so SNPs of the hIP gene may be associated with thrombotic events.  

In the present study, we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of the hIP gene in 10 Japanese healthy subjects, and found that the most frequent SNP was A984C in exon 3. Then, we investigated the relationship between this hIP gene SNP and platelet function. Primary platelet aggregation is dependent on the binding of ﬁbrinogen to platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa. The ﬁbrinogen receptor on platelets appears when GPIIb/IIIa changes to an active form via a conformation al change. Fibrinogen and PAC-1 are large GPIIb/IIIa ligands. The PAC-l antibody is used to monitor GPIIb/IIIa activation because it binds selectively and with high afﬁnity to activated platelets.   CD62P appears as a result of de granulation in response to stronger stimuli, such as contact with a damaged vessel wall.  

In the healthy control subjects, the appearance rate of the ﬁbrinogen receptor (PAC-1-positive platelets) was sign i cant ly higher in those homozygous for the minor allele (C/C) than for the major allele (A/A) of the hIP gene   $(p\leqslant0.05)$  . In contrast, CD62P expression was not sign i cant ly different among the hIP SNP genotypes. Thus, the  ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotype of the hIP gene may be considered to be a predictive marker for vascular events, including CI, even in apparently healthy subjects. This is the ﬁrst report that the A984C SNP of the hIP gene might be associated with altered platelet activation in the Japanese population.  

However, PAC-1 binding was not sign i cant ly different among the genotypes of this SNP in the patients with CI. The reason for this is not clear. There are multiple mechanisms of platelet activation, including high shear stress due to atherosclerosis and increased catecholamine, so other factors presumably play a major role.  

The A984C SNP is located in codon 328, which encodes one of the C-terminal serine residues that is phosphor y late d by Gprotein-coupled receptor kinases or second-messenger-activated protein kinase A and protein kinase C.   However, this SNP should not directly affect the function of the hIP gene product, because it does not change the encoded amino acid. Nevertheless, a similar study by Patrignani et al.   reported an association between the A984C SNP and enhanced platelet activation in patients with deep vein thrombosis. Moreover, our result is similar to that of Fontana et al.,   who reported that SNPs in the coding sequence of the TXA2 receptor (TP) gene inﬂuenced the results of platelet function tests in healthy volunteers, even though the amino acid sequence encoded by the SNPs was unaltered. Fontana et al. identiﬁed ﬁve SNPs in the coding sequence of the TP gene, and found that homozygosity of the minor allele of three SNPs (C795T, C924 and G1686A) was associated with decreased expression of CD62P when platelets were stimulated with a TXA2 agonist.  

Finally, we compared the distributions of the A984C SNP in the hIP gene between healthy control subjects and patients with CI, and found that the genotype distributions and allele frequencies were sign i cant ly different between the control group and the CI group. In particular, subjects with the   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotype are at greater risk for CI   $\left(p<0.001\right)$  ).  

Nakayama et al.   have previously reported that the C1117A polymorphism in exon 8 of the prost a cyclin synthase gene is

associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and may be a genetic marker for MI. However, this SNP should not directly affect the expression or function of prost a cyclin synthase, because it does not cause any change to the amino acid encoded by codon 373.  

Several possible explanations may be considered for our ﬁnding that the minor allele of the hIP gene was associated with the appearance of a conformation ally changed ﬁbrinogen receptor, even though this genotype is not associated with any change to the encoded amino acid. For example, the A984C SNP may be a genetic marker associated with functional mutation in hIP, or this SNP may be linked with changes to neighboring genes.  

There are some limitations of our study in the selection of the control subjects. The selection of the appropriate age-matched controls was difﬁcult, because control subjects aged around 60 years old frequently have risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dys lipid emi a. We eventually selected younger (non-age-matched) healthy volunteers, who had no history of ischemic cerebral disease, myocardial infarction, or diabetes melli- tus, as well as fewer risk factors. In addition, we did not check whether healthy controls had a symptomatic brain lesions by MRI. However, we believe that the difference in ages between the healthy subjects and the patients with CI (43 vs 59 years old) would not inﬂuence the A984C polymorphism of the IP gene, although risk factors could affect platelet activation. Furthermore, the fact that the higher rate of PAC-1-positive platelets in individuals with the minor hIP allele (C/C) is not related to aging may support this speculation.  

In conclusion, this is the ﬁrst report to present an association between hIP gene polymorphism and platelet activation. Our data suggest that the A984C polymorphism in the hIP gene is associated with platelet activation, and may be linked to the occurrence of CI in Japanese people. Thus, detection of this SNP may be useful for predicting the risk of CI. These ﬁndings may also open possible new avenues for preventative stroke therapy, such as with prostacyclin analogues.
