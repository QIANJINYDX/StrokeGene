# Abstract  

Background   Cerebral stroke (CS) is the leading cause of death in China, and a complex disease caused by both  alterable risk factors and genetic factors. This study intended to investigate the association of  MMP3 ,  MMP14 , and  MMP25  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with CS risk in a Chinese Han population.  

Methods   A total of 1,348 Han Chinese were recruited in this case-control study. Four candidate loci including  rs520540 A/G and rs679620 T/C of  MMP3 , rs2236302 G/C of  MMP14 , and rs10431961 T/C of  MMP25  were successfully  screened. The correlation between the four SNPs and CS risk was assessed by logistic regression analysis. The results  were analyzed by false-positive report probability (FPRP) for chance or significance. The interactions between four  SNPs associated with CS risk were assessed by multi factor dimensionality reduction (MDR).  

Results   rs520540 A/G and rs679620 C/T SNP in  MMP3  were associated with risk of CS in allele, codominant, dominant  and log-additive models. Ischemic stroke risk were significantly lower in carriers with rs520540-A allele and rs679620-T  allele than those with G/G or C/C genotypes. However, rs520540-A allele and rs679620-T allele were associated with  higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Stratified analysis showed that these two SNPs were associated with reduced risk  of CS in aged  $<55$   years, non-smoking and non-drinking participants, and rs679620 SNP also reduced CS risk in male  participants. The levels of uric acid, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and eosinophil were different among patients  with different genotypes of rs520540 and rs679620. No statistically significant association was found between  MMP14   rs2236302 G/C or  MMP25  rs10431961 T/C with CS even after stratification by stroke subtypes, age, gender as well as  smoking and drinking conditions in all the genetic models.  

Conclusion    MMP3  rs520540 A/G and rs679620 C/T polymorphisms were associated with CS risk in the Chinese Han  population, which provides useful information for the prevention and diagnosis of CS.

# Introduction  

Cerebral stroke (CS), commonly known as “stroke”, also  known as cerebro vascular accident, is an acute cerebro­ vascular disease caused by cerebral vascular obstruction  or sudden rupture of blood vessels. CS includes ischemic  stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS), of which IS (also  known as cerebral infarction) is the most pervasive class  of CS in clinic, accounting for about  $70\%\sim80\%$   of CS. HS  is commonly caused by intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH)  or sub ara ch noid hemorrhage. According to the Global  Burden of Disease Study 2019, the overall incidence of  CS in China was  $39.9\%$  , ranking first in the world [ 1 ]. CS  has become the second most common cause of death and  disability in the world [ 2 ], and the first cause of death in  China [ 3 ]. CS is a complex disease caused by modifiable  clinical risk factors (diet, physical inactivity, hyperten­ sion [ 4 ], smoking [ 5 ], diabetes [ 6 ], and dys lipid emi a [ 7 ])  and genetic factors. The results of a meta-analysis of  twin studies and family history studies have shown that  there is a clear genetic predisposition to CS. Moreover,  monozygotic twins are more likely to have CS at the same  time than fraternal twins, and people with a family his­ tory of CS are more likely to suffer from CS [ 8 ]. There­ fore, achieving a deep insight into the individual’s genetic  makeup and clinical exposures will expand our under­ standing on the occurrence of CS.  

Matrix metal lo protein as e (MMP) is a kind of calcium  ion-dependent endo pep tid as e that plays critical roles in  the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) of blood  vessels, thereby involving in the occurrence of many vas­ cular diseases including cerebro vascular at hero scl ero­ sis, HS and IS [ 9 ]. The single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of  MMPs  are present since birth and are known  to be associated with transcriptional activity, expres­ sion and changes in their enzymatic activities of MMPs  [ 10 ]. Hence, we speculated that  MMPs  gene polymor­ phisms might be involved in the occurrence of CS. This  case-control study selected four candidate SNPs ( MMP3 :  rs520540 A/G, rs679620 T/C;  MMP14 : rs2236302 G/C;  MMP25 : rs10431961 T/C) in 1,348 Han Chinese and  assessed the effect of these SNPs on the sus ce pti bil­ ity to CS. Meanwhile, we further studied the associa­ tion between SNPs and CS risk stratified by age, gender,  smoking, and drinking. Our study will enrich the data of  genetic loci related to CS risk in the Chinese Han pop­ ulation, and the discovered susceptibility loci can also  be used as genetic markers for predicting CS risk and  screening high-risk CS population, so as to provide theo­ retical basis for the early prevention and diagnosis of CS.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study participants  

Study participants including 674 CS patients and 674  healthy individuals were recruited from Xi’an No.3  Hospital of Shaanxi Province. CS patients were newly  diagnosed and confirmed by experienced specialists  according to the diagnostic criteria based on computed  tomography (CT) imaging. The inclusion criteria for  cases were patients with a first or definite diagnosis of CS  (cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, sub ara ch noid  hemorrhage, and unclassified stroke) in an outpatient or  inpatient setting. Patients with a history of other comor­ bid diseases (malignant tumors, metabolic disorders,  central nervous system infections, etc.) and other genetic  disorders were excluded. The control group included  healthy people who underwent physical examination in  the same hospital during the same period as case group  and were not diagnosed with CS, and healthy individuals  were matched with case group for age and sex (exclud­ ing confounding factors). Patients with complex chronic  diseases (excluding patients with cancer or a history of  cancer) were excluded. Besides, a professional physician  conducted a baseline survey of all participants’ general  demographic data (including gender, age, smoking and  drinking status).  

# Blood sample collection and DNA extraction  

Admission peripheral blood samples from each partici­ pant were collected in EDTA-anti coagulated blood col­ lection tubes and stored in a   $-20\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   refrigerator. After  that, we extracted and purified DNA according to the kit  instructions (GoldMag Co. Ltd., Xi’an, China). Eventu­ ally, the extracted DNA was stored in an ultra-low tem­ perature freezer at  $-80\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for future research.  

# SNP selection and genotyping  

A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was con­ ducted by STRING database ( http://string-db.org ) to  explore the functional enrichment analysis of  MMP3 ,  MMP14 ,  MMP25 . Meanwhile, Kyoto Encyclopedia of  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [ 11 ,  12 ] and gene ontol­ ogy (GO) [ 13 – 15 ] analysis was performed by R 4.0.5  software package. They were considered functionally  important at the   $p\!<\!0.05$   level. Subsequently, SNPs were  selected from the 1000 Genomes Project with minor  allele frequency   $(\mathrm{MAF})\!>\!0.05$  , Hardy-Weinberg equilib­ rium   $(\mathrm{HKE})\!>\!0.05,$  , and Tagger   $\mathrm{r}^{2}{<}0.8$  . Finally, this study  selected two sites   $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}520\mathrm{5}40\ \mathrm{A}/\mathrm{G}$   and   $\mathrm{rs}679620\ \mathrm{T}/\mathrm{C}$   on  the  MMP3  gene, one site   $\mathrm{rs}2236302\;\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{C}$   on the  MMP14   gene, and one site rs10431961 T/C on the  MMP25  gene.  The primers were designed by MassARRAY Assay Design  software. All SNPs in this study were genotyped using  the MassARRAY system (Agena, San Diego, CA, USA).  SNP genotypes were generated using iPLEX chemistry.  MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to obtain pro­ files of different mass peaks of multiple reactions, and  finally, genotyping was successfully completed.

# Statistical analysis  

Demographic characteristics of the participants, includ­ ing age   $'t.$  -test), gender, smoking, and drinking   $\upchi^{2}$  test)  were tested by SPSS 21.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) to  determine whether all SNPs met HWE. Odds ratios  (ORs) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) were calcu­ lated by logistic regression models to evaluate the cor­ relation between all candidate SNPs and CS risk. When   $\mathrm{OR}\!<\!1$  , it indicates that this SNP is a protective factor  against CS; when   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1$  , it shows that this SNP has no  effect on CS; when   $\mathrm{OR}\!>\!1$  , it indicates that this SNP is a  risk factor for CS. A variety of genetic models were evalu­ ated using PLINK 1.9 with wild-type alleles as references.  All tests were two-sided, and   $p\!<\!0.05$   was considered  statistically significant. Afterwards, the detection results  were analyzed by false-positive report probability (FPRP)  for chance or significance. Haplotype analysis was per­ formed by Haploview to calculate linkage d is equilibrium  (LD). The interactions between four SNPs associated  with CS risk were assessed by multi factor dimensional­ ity reduction (MDR). Differences in clinical character is­ tics of patients with different genotypes were analyzed by  one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).  

# Results  

# Sample overview  

Basic demographic and epidemiological information  about subjects is presented in Table  1 . There were 1,348  unrelated participants in this case-control study, includ­ ing 674 CS patients (455 males   $(67.5\%)$   and 219 females   $(32.5\%))$   with an average age of   $54.85\pm6.759$   years, and  674 healthy individuals (443 males   $(65.5\%)$   and 231  females   $(34.3\%)_{,}$  ) with an average age of   $55.61\pm9.130$    years. There were no significant differences in mean age   $(p{=}0.080)$  , gender   $(p{=}0.488)$  , smoking   $(p{=}0.827)$  ), and  drinking   $(p{=}0.827)$   between the two groups. However,  there were significant discrepancies in the levels of uric  acid (UA), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),  eosinophil (EOS), globulin (GLOB), monocyte (MON),  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and red  blood cell (RBC) between these two groups.  

# Genotyping of candidate SNPs  

The results of the functional enrichment analysis are  shown in Fig.  1 . We constructed a PPI network analysis  based on  MMP3/MMP14/MMP25  genes. The enrich­ ment analysis showed that these genes were enriched in  TNF signaling pathway. The possible biological process  (BP) of these overlapping genes were related to the extra­ cellular matrix organization and extracellular structure  organization. In this study, four candidate loci were suc­ cessfully screened:  MMP3  rs520540 A/G and rs679620

T/C,  MMP14  rs2236302 G/C, and  MMP25  rs10431961   $\mathrm{T/C}$  . These four SNPs were in line with HWE   $(p\!>\!0.05)$  ,  and MAF was greater than   $5\%$   in the tested population.  The specific information about all candidate SNPs is  shown in Table  2 . In addition, we found significant dif­ ferences in  MMP3  rs520540 A/G genotype frequency   $(p{=}0.049)$   and allele frequency   $(p{=}0.016)$   as well as  MMP3  rs679620 T/C genotype frequency   $(p{=}0.033)$    and allele frequency   $(p{=}0.012)$   between CS patients and  healthy controls (Fig.  2 ).  

# Association between candidate SNPs and CS risk  

The association between the the four candidate SNPs and  the risk of CS is shown in Fig.  3 . The results showed that  MMP3  rs520540 A/G and rs679620 T/C SNPs were sig­ nificantly associated with CS risk. In particular, rs520540  A/G significantly reduced CS risk under the allele (A  vs. G:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.83$  ,   $95\%$   CI   $0.70{-}0.97$  ,   $p{=}0.018,$  ), codomi­ nant (AG vs. GG:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.79$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.63-1.00,  $p{=}0.049.$  ),  dominant (AG-AA vs. GG:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.77$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.62–0.96,   $p{=}0.022)$  ), and log-additive models (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.82$  ,   $95\%$   CI  0.70–0.97,   $p{=}0.018,$  ). Meanwhile, rs679620 T/C could  notably decrease the risk of CS under the allele (T vs. C:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.82$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.70–0.96,  $p{=}0.014,$  ), codominant (CT  vs. CC:  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.77$  ,  $95\%\operatorname{CI}0.62{-}0.97,$  ,  $p{=}0.028,$  ), dominant  (CT-TT vs. CC:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.76$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.61–0.94,   $p{=}0.013.$  ),  and log-additive models (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.82$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.69–0.96,   $p{=}0.014)$  ). However, no correlation was found between  

![](images/ecf2c7bbd12169d21d283f9401da3a8fcaaa2e27692c56fe87b6dce9cd79ee3a.jpg)  

the remaining two SNPs   $(M M P14\mathrm{{\rs}2236302\ G/C},$  , and  MMP25  rs10431961 T/C) and CS risk   $(p\!>\!0.05)$  .  

Furthermore, we stratified the CS patients into isch­ emic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke groups, and analyzed  the association between these four SNPs with stroke sub­ types. In this study, 610 patients suffered from IS and 64  patients had HS, and the healthy controls were randomly  selected using SPSS 26.0 software at 1:1 of case-control  for the two types of stroke, respectively. After adjust­ ing for age, gender, smoking and drinking history, the  OR with   $95\%$   CI and   $p$   values were calculated between  SNPs and IS/HS risk using logistic analysis (Table   3 ).  The results showed that  MMP3  rs520540 A allele and   $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}679620\ \mathrm{T}$   allele were associated with decreased risk of  IS (A vs. G:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.64$  ,   $95\%$   CI   $0.07{-}0.85$  ,   $p{<}0.001$  ; T vs.  C:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.80$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.07–0.84,  $p{=}0.018.$  ), their protec­ tive effects against IS were also found in codominant,  dominant and log-additive models. Meanwhile,  MMP3   rs520540 A allele and rs679620 T allele may associate  with higher risk of HS, although no significant difference  were indicated. The  MMP3  rs520540 A/G genotype and   $\mathrm{rs}679620\;\mathrm{C/T}$   genotype carried a significant increase in  the risk of HS, particularly in dominant and log-additive  models. Furthermore, no statistically significant asso­ ciation was found between  MMP14  rs2236302 G/C or  MMP25  rs10431961 T/C and two stroke subtypes.  

# Stratified analysis of the association between candidate  SNPs and CS risk  

Age and gender  Stratified by age and gender, the cor­ relation between the four SNPs and CS risk is presented  in Table   4 . The results indicated that rs520540 could  remarkably decrease the risk of CS in subjects aged  ${\le}55$    years under a variety of genetic models (allele:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.79$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.63–0.99,   $p{=}0.039$  ; codominant:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.66$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.47–0.92,   $p{=}0.014$  ; dominant:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.67$  ,   $95\%$    C  $\mathrm{CI}\ 0.49{-}0.91$  ,   $p{=}0.011$  ; log-additive:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.77$  ,   $95\%$   CI  0.61–0.97,  $p{=}0.030$  ). rs679620 was a protective factor not

only in CS patients aged  $\le\!55$   years under multiple genetic  models (allele:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.80$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.63-1.00,   $p{=}0.048$  ;  codominant:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.63$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.45–0.88,   $p{=}0.007$  ;  dominant:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.65$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.48–0.89,   $p{=}0.008$  ; logadditive:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.78$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.62–0.99,  $p{=}0.038.$  ), but also  in CS patients aged  ${>}\,55$   years under two genetic mod­ els (codominant:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.58$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.35–0.98,  $p{=}0.040$  ;  recessive:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.62$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.38-1.00,   $p{=}0.049.$  ). Mean­ while, it was also a protective factor in males (dominant: 

  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.76$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.58–0.99,   $p{=}0.045$  ; log-additive: 

  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.81$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.67–0.99,   $p{=}0.044\$  ). Additionally,  rs2236302 could notably reduce CS risk in males (allele: 

  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.72$  ,   $95\%$   CI   $0.53{-}0.99$  ,   $p{=}0.039$  ; codominant: 

  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.69$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.49–0.97,  $p{=}0.035,$  ). Nevertheless, we  did not find any association of rs10431961 with CS risk  and any association between the four candidate SNPs and  CS risk in females   $(p\!>\!0.05)$  .  

Smoking and drinking  Stratified by smoking and  drinking, the correlation between the four SNPs and CS  risk is presented in Table   5 . The results indicated that  rs520540 reduced the risk of CS in both non-smokers 

  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.79$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.42–0.98,  $p{=}0.034)$  ) and non-drinkers 

 (  $\mathrm{{CR}}\!=\!0.78$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.62–0.97,   $p{=}0.024,$  ) participants in  the allele model. And rs679620 reduced the risk of CS in  non-smoking subjects in the allele model (  $\mathrm{{CR}}\!=\!0.77$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}~0.62–0.96$  ,  $p{=}0.018,$  ). Meanwhile, it decreased CS risk  in non-drinking participants under a variety of genetic  models (allele:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.76$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.61–0.95,   $p{=}0.014$  ;  codominant:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.59$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.36–0.99,   $p{=}0.047$  ;  dominant:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.72$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.52–0.98,   $p{=}0.039$  ; logadditive:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.76$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.61–0.97,   $p{=}0.025,$  ). Fur­ thermore, we found no correlation of rs2236302 and  rs10431961 with CS risk and no association between the  four candidate SNPs and CS risk in smokers and drinkers   $(p\!>\!0.05)$  .  

# Differences in clinical characteristics of patients with  different genotypes  

The associations between the four candidate SNPs and  clinical characteristics of CS patients with different geno­ types are presented in Table  6 . The results showed that  the rs520540 AA genotype was linked with the reduced  levels of UA, HDL-C, and EOS in CS patients. And the  rs679620 TT genotype was connected with the increased  levels of UA, HDL-C, EOS, and GLOB in CS patients.  The  MMP14  rs2236302 GG genotype was associated with

the reduced levels of MON. The  MMP25  rs10431961  TT genotype was associated with the increased levels of  LDL-C and the reduced levels of RBC.  

# FPRP analysis  

Detailed results of FPRP analysis are displayed in Table  S1 . The results showed that the correlation between  rs679620 and CS risk in subjects aged  ${>}\,55$   years was not  noteworthy at a prior probability level of 0.25 and a FPRP  threshold of 0.2. Meanwhile, the association between  rs679620 and CS risk in non-drinkers under the homo­ zygous model was not noteworthy. The FPRP values of  other results were all less than 0.2 at a prior probability  level of 0.25, suggesting that these positive results were  noteworthy.

# LD and haplotype analysis  

LD results of the candidate SNPs are shown in Fig.   4 ,  and haplotype analysis results are presented in Table  S2 .  The results indicated that there was linkage disequilib­ rium between rs520540 and rs679620. Meanwhile, the  results of haplotype analysis showed that the distribution  of the haplotype   $\mathrm{A_{rs520540}T_{r s679620}}$   was associated with a  decreased risk of CS   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.82$  ,  $p{=}0.018,$  ).  

# MDR analysis

# Discussion  

This study is the first to analyze the association of  MMP3  (rs520540 A/G and rs679620 T/C),  MMP14   (rs2236302 G/C), and  MMP25  (rs10431961 T/C) gene  polymorphisms with CS risk in Chinese Han population.  We found that  MMP3  gene polymorphisms (rs520540  A/G and   $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}679620\ \mathrm{T}/\mathrm{C})$   were associated with CS risk.  Notably, they played a protective role against IS develop­ ment, rather than in HS.  

ECM remodeling is an essential process in the patho­ genesis of atherosclerosis and IS. MMPs act as fun­ damental mediators for matrix turnover by their  protein-digesting enzymatic activities in catalyzing the  breakdown of major ECM components, such as colla­ gen, elastin, gelatin, and other glycoproteins and proteo­ glycans [ 16 ]. MMP3 is an important member of MMPs  that activates other MMPs, such as MMP1, MMP7, and  MMP9, making MMP3 essential in connective tissue and  ECM remodeling, resulting in plaque instability [ 17 ,  18 ].  MMP3 is expressed in various vascular tissues and cells,  including endo the li al cells and vascular smooth mus­ cle cells, thereby modulating various vascular diseases.  Alvarez-sabín et al. [ 19 ] have found that the expression of  MMP3  is up-regulated in patients with cerebral hemor­ rhage. A study in a mouse middle cerebral artery embo­ lization model has revealed that tissue-type plasminogen  activator (t-PA) treatment induces  MMP3  expression lev­ els in peripheral blood and increases hemorrhagic events,  which is thought to be related to the disruption of vas­ cular endo the li al barrier by MMP3 [ 20 ].  MMP3  SNP is  associated with reduced in vitro promoter activity and  expression [ 21 ].  MMP3  (-1171)   $5\mathrm{~A}/6\mathrm{A}\!+\!5$    A/5A geno­ types and 5 A allele were significantly higher in patients  with IS than in controls and contributed to different

subtypes of IS susceptibility [ 16 ]. Circulating MMP3  level was significantly higher in patients with 5  A/6A  or 5 A/5A genotype than in patients with 6 A/6A geno­ type.  MMP3  5 A allele carrier may bear a higher risk of  recurrence among patients with the stroke subtype of  large-artery atherosclerosis [ 22 ]. Kaplan et al. found that  MMP3  rs3025058 SNP was associated with increased  risk of hemorrhagic stroke [ 23 ]. In the overall analysis,  this study found that two SNPs of  MMP3  (rs520540 A/G  and rs679620 T/C) were associated with the reduced  risk of IS in the Chinese Han population. In contrary  to our findings, the study by Kim et al. [ 24 ] has shown  that both rs520540 and rs679620 of  MMP3  increase the  risk of IS in the Korean population. Some studies have  shown that  MMP  gene polymorphisms can be influ­ enced by racial and ethnic background and ultimately  affect the onset of IS [ 10 ]. Therefore, we speculate that  racial differences may cause the inconsistency between  our results and those of previous studies, and we need to  further verify our hypothesis in different populations. At  the same time, the results demonstrated that rs520540-A  allele and rs679620-T allele were associated with higher  risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Our finding that the same  MMP3  haplotype (rs520540-A/G allele and rs679620- T/C) appeared to protect against thrombotic events (i.e.,  ischemic stroke) and promote bleeding events (i.e., hem­ orrhagic stroke) may be explained by cleavage of coagula­ tion and fi bri no ly tic proteins (plasminogen, plasminogen  activator inhibitor-1, fibrinogen) by MMP3.  

Former research has revealed that risk factors such as  age, gender [ 25 ], and smoking [ 5 ] contribute to the devel­ opment of CS. Consequently, our study stratified the  participants according to the above factors. The results  indicated that both rs520540 and rs679620 of  MMP3 significantly reduced CS risk in non-smoking and nondrinking participants. Consistent with our results, the  study by Larsson et al. [ 5 ] has shown that some gene  polymorphisms is positively and statistically associated  with IS, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke in  smokers. Another study has shown that there is a cor­ relation between drinking and an increased risk of CS  [ 26 ]. Thus, the association of rs520540 and rs679620 with  the risk of CS may be affected by smoking and drinking.  Meanwhile, we noticed rs679620 also reduced the risk  of CS in male participants. Some studies have shown  that genetic polymorphisms are correlated with CS risk  in males [ 27 ,  28 ], which is consistent with our findings,  whereas some studies have demonstrated that genetic  polymorphisms have a significant correlation with CS  risk in females [ 29 ,  30 ]. Therefore, we consider there may  be gender differences in susceptibility to CS and further  validation is needed to support our conclusions.  

Tumor necrosis factor   $\upalpha$   (TNFα) is mainly secreted  by microglia and plays an important role in maintain­ ing homeostasis in the central nervous system [ 31 ].  Simultaneously, TNFα is a pro inflammatory cytokine  related to innate immune response, which is related to  a variety of neuro degenerative diseases including Par­ kinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple scle­ rosis, ischemic brain injury, etc., and is considered to  be one of the important indicators of the severity of IS  [ 32 ,  33 ]. TNF modulates tissue damage in experimental  CS and is a potential target for future CS therapy [ 34 ].  However, excessive TNFα are associated with inflamma­ tory cascade reactions by amplifying and exacerbating  the inflammatory response and, in severe cases, trigger­ ing systemic inflammatory response syndrome [ 35 ,  36 ].  

Therefore, appropriate TNF plays an important proin­ flammatory role in CS. Our study found that the most  important functional terms enriched in  MMP3/MMP14 genes was TNF signaling pathway. And the possible BP of  MMP3/MMP14/MMP25  genes were related to the extra­ cellular matrix organization and extracellular structure  organization. TNF signaling pathway has been shown to  induce the expression of MMPs [ 37 ]. In addition,   $\mathrm{TN}\kappa$  can activate nuclear factor of kappaB (NF-κB), and the  activated NF-κB further induces the secretion of   $\mathrm{TN}\upalpha_{z}$  ,  which leads to the increased release of MMP activity and  finally promotes cell invasion and metastasis [ 38 ]. There­ fore, we hypothesized that  MMP3  rs520540/rs679620  and  MMP14  rs2236302 may play a role in the occurrence  of CS through TNF signaling pathway. However, further  experiments are needed to verify our conjecture.  

In addition, studies have shown that the levels of UA,  HDL-C and EOS in CS patients are significantly higher  than those in normal people [ 39 – 41 ]. In our study, we  found that the rs520540 A/G genotype was linked with  the reduced levels of UA and EOS and higher HDL-C  in CS patients. And this pattern was true for  MMP3 rs679620 T/C in affecting the levels of UA, EOS and  HDL-C. Therefore, rs520540 A/G and rs679620 T/C  seemed exhibiting protective roles against CS.  

However, our study still has certain limitations. First, it  was limited by the relative sample size in elucidating the  association between SNPs and the occurance of stroke,  particularly for the hemorrhagic stroke. Second, all par­ ticipants were recruited in one medical center and only  Han Chinese population were enrolled, thus the conclu­ sion should be extrapolated with caution since genetic  variation strongly related to ethnic background. Mean­ while, the conclusion should be validated in more clinical  centers in a large sample size. Third, our study associ­ ated the  MMP3  SNPs with laboratory parameters, and  deep insights into the association between SNPs and IS  e tio logical subtypes, severity and prognosis should be  explored in further studies due to the disease heterogene­ ity. Besides, the interplay between  MMP3  SNP and that  in other  MMPs  members should be comprehensively  analyzed depending complete sequencing and studies  on the underlying mechanism are needed. Despite the  above shortcoming, our study sheds new light on the  association of  MMP3  (rs520540 A/G and   $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}679620\;\mathrm{T}/\mathrm{C})$  ,  MMP14  (rs2236302 G/C), and  MMP25  (rs10431961  T/C) gene polymorphisms with CS risk.  

# Conclusion  

In summary, this study first explored the correla­ tion of  MMP3  (rs520540 A/G and rs679620 T/C),  MMP14  (rs2236302 G/C), and  MMP25  (rs10431961  T/C) gene polymorphisms with CS risk in the Chinese  Han population. The results showed that there was a  certain association between  MMP3  gene polymorphisms  (rs520540 A/G and rs679620 T/C) and CS risk.  MMP3   rs520540 A/G and rs679620 T/C may exhibit different  paradigms in affecting the initiation and progression  of IS and HS, where rs520540 A and rs679620 T alleles  exhibited protective roles against IS while promoted the  occurrence of HS. Our study further enriches the data of  susceptibility loci for CS in the Chinese Han population,  and provides a preliminary molecular basis for the pre­ vention, diagnosis and treatment of CS.
