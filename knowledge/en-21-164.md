Neuronal expression of ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 1 (ABCB1) has been demonstrated after  brain ischemia. To investigate whether ABCB1 polymorphisms are associated with the development, risk factors (hypertension,  dys lipid emi a, and diabetes mellitus), severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS), and sequelae (Modified Barthel  Index, MBI) of ischemic stroke (IS), four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ABCB1 gene [rs4148727, promoter,  -154T>C; rs3213619,   $5'$  -un translation region (5’UTR), -129T>C); rs1128503, synonymous, Gly412 (  $\mathrm{C}{>}^{r}$  T); rs3842, 3’UTR,   $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{>}$  G]  were analyzed in 121 IS patients and 291 control subjects. SNPStats and SPSS 18.0 were used to obtain odds ratios (OR),   $95\%$    confidence intervals (CI), and p values. Multiple logistic regression models (co dominant 1, co dominant 2, dominant, recessive, and  log-additive models) were applied to analyze the genetic data. The rs3842 SNP was weakly associated with the development of IS   $\mathrm{(p{=}0.020\$   in co dominant 1 model and  $\mathrm{p{=}0.028}$   in dominant model). In the analysis of clinical phenotypes, ABCB1 polymorphisms  were nominally associated with hypertension (rs3213619 and rs3842,  $\mathrm{p{<}0.05,}$  ), dys lipid emi a (rs1128503,   $\mathrm{p{<}0.05}$  ), diabetes (rs3842,   $\mathrm{p{<}0.05,}$  ), and NIHSS (rs4148727,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05$  ). Interestingly, rs3842 showed statistically strong association between IS with hypertension  and IS without hypertension (Fisher’s exact  $\mathrm{p{=}}0.003$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.11$  ,  $95\%$   CI=0.03-0.51 in recessive model). These results suggest that the  ABCB1 gene may be associated with the development and clinical phenotypes of IS in Korean population.

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is the second most common cause of death and one  of major causes of disability around the world. Stroke may be  divided into two major categories by etiology: Ischemic stroke  (IS), which is about   $80\%$  , and hemorrhagic stroke, about   $20\%$  [1].  Environmental factors including hypertension, hyper lipid emi a,  and smoking are risk factors of stroke, and genetic factors also  influence susceptibility to stroke [2-4]. Recently, genetic studies  have shown the association between the development of stroke  and genetic polymorphisms. Dahabreh et al. [5] reported that  para oxon as e 1 (PON1) polymorphism [rs662, Gln192Arg   $_\mathrm{(A>G)}$  )] contributed to the risk of IS. Lim et al. [6] showed that the  synonymous SNP [rs2228048, Asn389 (  $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{>}$  T)] of transforming  growth factor, beta receptor II (TGFBR2) might be associated with  the development of intra cranial hemorrhage (ICH) in Korean  population. Park et al. [7] found that the C alleles of rs3804099  [Asn199 (  $\mathrm{{'T>C)}}$  ] and rs3804100 [Ser450   $\mathrm{(T\!>\!C)}$  ] of toll-like  receptor 2 (TLR2) gene were associated with National Institutes of  

Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of IS patients.  

ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 1  (ABCB1) is a protein which confers resistance towards multiple  cytostatic drugs (multidrug resistance) in tumor cells. ABCB1 is  also known as multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and P-glycoprotein  (PGY1) [8]. The previous studies about ABCB1 have been  mainly focused on drug efflux function associated with tumor  chemotherapy including colorectal cancer [9], breast cancer [10],  and brain tumor [10]. However, ABCB1 exports endogenous  inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin s and leu kotri ene s,  which may aggravate the inflammation and destruction of various  size of ischemized tissue, from the initial steps to latent steps of  inflammation [11]. In the central nervous system (CNS), ABCB1  is normally expressed in blood-brain barrier (BBB) [12]. In the  mouse model of IS, the increased ABCB1 in brain tissue was  able to efflux drugs despite of permeable BBB [13]. Neuronal  expression of ABCB1 has been demonstrated after brain ischemia  [14]. ABCB1 expression was increased in human capillary  endo the li al cells under hypoxia [15]. In addition, Bochud et al.  [16] suggested that ABCB1 is related to hypertension  via  the  renin–angiotensin–aldo ster one system. Although ABCB1 may  contribute to the pathogen es is or path o physiology of IS, however,  there was no case-control study analyzed the relationship between  ABCB1 and IS.  

In this study, we assessed the association between four SNPs  of the ABCB1 gene [promoter SNP (rs4148727,   $\mathrm{-154~T{>}C}$  ),   $5^{\circ}$  -unt ran la tion region (5’UTR) SNP (rs3213619,   $.129\mathrm{T}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{C}$  ), exon  SNP [rs1128503, Gly412(  $\mathrm{(C>T)}$  )], and 3’UTR SNP (rs3842,  $_\mathrm{A>G}$  )]  and the development, risk factors (hypertension, dys lipid emi a,  and diabetes mellitus), severity (NIHSS), and sequelae (Modified  Barthel Index, MBI) of IS in Korean population.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Patients with IS and control subjects  

One hundred twenty one IS patient and 291 control subjects  were included. IS patients were enrolled among participants who  diagnosed at the East-West Neomedical Center and Kyung Hee  Medical Center (Seoul, Korea), during 2009-2012. The diagnosis  of IS were confirmed through computed tomography (CT),  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography, or duplex  sonography by well-trained neurologists. Subjects with accidental  or iatrogenic stroke, transient ischemic attack, brain tumors, or  other cerebro vascular disorders were excluded. Controls were  enrolled among participants examined through general health  check-up program. Controls with stroke, ischemic heart diseases,  neurological diseases, or any severe underlying diseases were

excluded. This study was conducted according to the guidelines of  the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the ethics review  committee of Medical Research Institute, School of Medicine,  Kyung Hee University (Seoul, Korea). Informed consent was  obtained from all individuals. If a patient was in in communicable  state, we obtained informed consent from close relatives or legal  guardian.  

# Clinical subgroups of IS  

All of IS patients were divided into subgroups in accordance with  the clinical features (Table 1). The abnormal range of the clinical  features were as following: hypertension,  ${>}140~\mathrm{mmHg}$  in systolic  blood pressure (SBP) or  ${\mathrm{>}90~\mathrm{mmHg}}$   in diastolic blood pressure  (DBP); diabetes mellitus,   ${>}126~\mathrm{mg/FL}$   in fasting plasma glucose  or  $>6.5\%$   hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c); dys lipid emi a,   ${>}250~\mathrm{mg/dl}$  in total cholesterol (TC),  ${>}150~\mathrm{mg/d}$   in triglyceride (TG), or   ${<}40$    mg/dl (male) and   ${<}50\;\mathrm{mg/dl}$   (female) in high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C). The severity of IS was scaled by the NIHSS,  because it is common and sensitive tool for checking neurological  status [17]. NIHSS is a 15-item impairment scale, consisted of the  level of consciousness (3 items), extra ocular movements, visual  fields defects, facial palsy, extremity strength (4 items), sensory  deficit, ataxia, aphasia, dysarthria, and neglect [18]. The sequelae,  disabilities caused by neurologic damages of IS, was analyzed  with the MBI. MBI scale measures 10-items of the self-care and  mobility, consisted of bowels (10 points), bladder (10 points),  grooming (5 points), toilet use (10 points), feeding (10 points),  transfer (15 points), mobility (15 points), dressing (10 points),  stairs (10 points), and bathing (5 points), with total score 100 [19].  MBI score is known to correlate with infarct volume [20].  

# SNP selection and genotyping  

We searched the promoter and exon regions of the ABCB1 gene  in the SNP database of the National Center for Biotechnology  Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP, BUILD 135).  We selected four SNPs [rs4148727, -154T>C; rs3213619, 5’UTR 

 (  $\mathrm{.}129\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C})$  ), rs1128503, Gly412 (  $\mathrm{C}\!>\!\mathrm{T}$  ), and rs3842, 3’UTR 

  $_\mathrm{(A>G)}$  ] of the ABCB1. Peripheral blood sample of all subjects was  collected in EDTA tube, and genomic DNA was extracted using  DNA Isolation Kit for Cells and Tissues (Roche, Indianapolis,  IN, USA). Genotypes of each SNP were determined by direct  sequencing (MACROGEN, Seoul, Korea). PCRs were performed  as the following condition: 40 cycles at   $94^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$  C for 30 sec, 58  $58^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C for  30 sec, 72  $72\mathrm{{}^{o}C}$  C for 30 sec, and 1 cycle at 72  $72\mathrm{{}^{o}C}$  C for   $5\;\mathrm{{min}}$   for the final  reaction. The primer sequences used for PCRs were as following:  for rs3842, sense primer GG CACA GAA A GG CAT CT AT TTT,  antisense primer CAA GG CA GTC AGT TACA GT CCA; for  rs1128503, sense primer CCC ATC TCG AAA AGA AGT TAAG G,  antisense primer CAT CT CAC CAT CCCC T CT GT; for rs3213619,  sense primer A TTC CT CC TG GAA A TTC A ACC T, antisense  primer TT GG GA ACT GTC CCA TAG TAG C; for rs4148727,  sense primer G GTC TTC CCA GTA ACC T ACCA A, antisense  primer TT AT CCC AGT ACCA GAG GAG GA. The PCR products  were sequenced by an ABI PRISM 3730XL analyzer (PE Applied  Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and sequencing data were  analyzed using SeqManII software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI,  USA).  

# Statistical analysis  

Multiple logistic regression models were applied using follow­ ing models: co dominant 1 (major allele homozygotes  vs.  hetero­ zygotes), co dominant 2 (major allele homozygotes  vs.  minor  allele homozygotes), dominant (major allele homozygotes  vs.   heterozygotes  $^{,+}$  minor allele homozygotes), recessive (major allele  homozygotes+heterozygotes  vs.  minor allele homozygotes), and  log-additive (major allele homozygotes  vs.  heterozygotes  vs.  minor  allele homozygotes) models. Odds ratios (OR),  $95\%$   confidence  intervals (CI), and p-values were determined using SNPStats  (http://bioinfo.icon co logia.net/index.php?module  ${}^{\ast}=$  Snpstats)  and SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The linkage  d is equilibrium (LD) block and haplotypes were estimated using  Haploview version 4.2 (Daly Lab, Cambridge, MA, USA). The  significant p-value was considered below 0.05.  

# RESULTS  

One hundred twenty-one IS patients and 291 control subjects  were analyzed. The age of IS group (mean±standard deviation)  was   $65.7{\pm}12.1\$   years and control was   $63.0{\pm}9.3\$   years (Table 1).  

Table 2 shows the genotype and allele frequencies of the four  examined rs4148727,   $_-154\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$  ; rs3213619, 5’UTR(-  $\cdot129\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C})$  ,  rs1128503, Gly412(  $\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}_{c}$  ), and rs3842, 3’UTR(  $\mathrm{(A}{>}\mathrm{G)}$  )] of ABCB1  in the control and IS groups. The genotype distributions of the  four tested SNPs were consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium in the control group (  $\mathrm{(p{>}0.05}$  , data not shown). The  rs3842 SNP was weakly associated with the risk of IS   $\mathrm{(p{=}0.020\$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.58$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.36{-}0.92$   in co dominant 1 model and  $\mathrm{p{=}0.028}$  ,  OR  $\mathord{=}0.62$  ,   $95\%$   CI=0.40-0.95 in dominant model). However, the  allele frequencies of rs3842 showed no difference between the  IS group and the control group. Other three SNPs (rs4148727,  rs3213619, rs1128503) were not associated with the development  of IS   $\mathrm{(p{>}0.05)}$  .  

LD block was applied using Haploview 4.2. The LD block in the  four examined SNPs was not constructed (Fig. 1). Therefore we  did not showed the haplotype among the four examined SNPs.  

In order to investigate correlation between ABCB1 and clinical  phenotypes of IS, the IS patients were divided into two subgroups  in accordance with the clinical and biochemical features (  $\mathrm{(n}{=}35$  IS without hypertension  vs.    $\mathrm{n{=}81}$   IS with hypertension;  $\mathrm{n{=}86}$   IS  without dys lipid emi a  vs.  $\mathrm{n{=}}33$   IS patients with dys lipid emi a;   $\mathrm{n{=}72}$    IS without diabetes mellitus  vs.    $\mathrm{n{=}}45$   IS with diabetes mellitus; 

  $\mathrm{n{=}}56$   NIHSS score   ${<}6$    vs.  $\mathrm{n{=}}57$  NIHSS score   ${\geq}6;$     $\mathrm{n{=}71}$   MBI score 

  ${<\!60}$    vs.  $\mathrm{n{=}}25$  MBI score  ${\geq}60$  ) (Table 1).  

Table 3 represents the genotype and allele frequencies of the four  examined SNPs in IS subgroups in accordance with hypertension.  The two SNPs of ABCB1 (rs3213619 and rs3842) were associated  with the hypertension in IS (rs3213619,   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.035$  , Fisher’s exact   $\mathrm{p{=}0.020}$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.26$  ,   $95\%$   CI=0.07-0.91 in co dominant 1 model;  rs3842,  $\mathrm{p{=}}0.015$  , Fisher’s exact  $\mathrm{p{=}0.016}$   OR  $\backsimeq\!0.15$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI{=}}0.03.$  -

 0.70 in co dominant 2 model,   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.0023$  , Fisher’s exact   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.003$  , 

  $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.11\ 95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.03{\cdot}0.51$   in recessive model). The C allele  frequency of rs3213619 SNP was lower in the hypertension   $(+)$    group   $(3.1\%)$   than that in the hypertension (-) group   $(11.4\%)$  . The  difference in the allele frequency of rs3213619 was statistically  significant (  $\mathrm{\Deltap{=}0.018}$  , Fisher’s exact   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.024$  , OR  $\scriptstyle\cdot=0.25$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.28{-}0.78\$  ). Two SNPs (rs4148727 and rs1128503) were not  related to hypertension in IS.  

One coding SNP of ABCB1 [rs1128503, Gly412(  $\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}$  )] showed  weak association with dys lipid emi a (  $\mathrm{(p{=}0.040\$  , OR  $\mathrel{\mathop:}=\!0.40$  ,   $95\%$    CI=0.17-0.96 in co dominant 1 model,   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.02$  , OR=0.37,   $95\%$    CI=0.16-0.86 in dominant model,   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.018$  , OR  $\scriptstyle{=0.45}$  ,   $95\%$

CI=0.23-0.90 in log-additive model). The C allele frequency of  rs1128503 was lower in dys lipid emi a   $(+)$   group   $(25.8\%)$   than  that in the dys lipid emi a (-) group   $(41.8\%)$  . The difference was  statistically significant   $\mathrm{(p{=}0.024}$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.48$  ,   $95\%$   CI=0.26-0.10).  Three SNPs (rs4148727, rs3213619, and rs3842) were not related  to dys lipid emi a in IS (data not shown).  

One SNP of ABCB1 [rs3842, 3’UTR(  $\mathrm{\AA}>$  G)] showed weak  association with diabetes mellitus (Fisher’s exact   $\mathrm{p{=}0.046}$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.15$  ,   $95\%$   CI=0.02-1.22 in co dominant 2 model,   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.029$  ,  Fisher’s exact   $\mathrm{p{=}0.049}$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.15$  ,  $95\%$   CI=0.02-1.23 in recessive  model). The allele frequencies of rs4148727 were not significantly  different. Three SNPs (rs4148727, rs3213619, and rs1128503) were  not related to diabetes mellitus in IS (data not shown).  

Finally, one promoter SNP of ABCB1 (rs4148727, -154T>C) was  marginally associated with NIHSS in IS (  $\mathrm{(p{=}0.034}$  , Fisher’s exact 

  $\mathrm{p{=}0.042}$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}3.31$  ,   $95\%$   CI=1.09-10.01 in codominant1 model, 

  $\mathrm{p{=}}0.032$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.99$  ,   $95\%$   CI=1.05-8.48 in dominant model). Three  SNPs (rs3213619, rs1128503, and rs3842) were not related to  NIHSS in IS (data not shown).  

The four examined SNPs showed no association with MBI in IS  (  $\mathrm{p{>}}0.05$  , data not shown).

# DISCUSSION  

In this study, we investigated the relationships between the  four SNPs of ABCB1 [rs4148727, -154T>C; rs3213619, 5’UTR(-  $129\mathrm{T}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{C}$  ), rs1128503, Gly412(  $\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}_{c}$  ), and rs3842, 3’UTR(  $_\mathrm{A>G}$  )]  and IS in Korean population. Our result suggests that ABCB1  might be associated with the development, risk factors (hyper­ tension, dys lipid emi a, and diabetes mellitus), and severity (NIHSS)  of IS. Some studies documented the association between ABCB1  polymorphisms (rs3213619, rs1128503, and rs3842) and certain  diseases. Fujii et al. [21] investigated the relationship between  ABCB1 SNPs (rs2188524, rs3213619, rs1128503, rs2032582,  and rs1045642) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in the  Japanese, they observed that T allele of rs1045642 is risk factor  for MDD. Urayama et al. [22] reported that haplotype CGC  (rs3213619, rs1128503, and rs2032582) may be less susceptible to  the leuk emo geni c effects of indoor insecticide exposures.  

In present study, we observed that rs4148727 was associated with  the severity of IS (NIHSS). There was no study about rs4148727  of ABCB1 to date. The T and C allele frequencies in rs4148727  have been reported to be 0.976 and 0.024 in European, 0.950 and  0.050 in Hispanic, 0.917 and 0.083 in Asian, and 0.909 and 0.091  in Sub-Saharan African, respectively (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/projects/SNP). In our controls, the T and C allele frequencies  of rs4148727 were 0.869 and 0.131. The allele frequency of  rs4148727 showed no ethnic difference. To investigate the binding  site of transcription factors for the T and C alleles of rs4148727  (  $_-154\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C})$  , we used the online program AliBaba2.1 (http://www. gene-regulation.com/pub/programs/alibaba2). The C allele in  rs4148727 has an activation protein (AP)-1 transcription factor  binding site, whereas the T allele has no AP-1 binding site. AP-1 is  a transcription factor encoded by the gene JUN proto-oncogene.  The transcription factor AP-1 is involved in cellular proliferation,  transformation and death [23]. Regarding that ABCB1 is  implicated in cancer chemotherapy [9, 10], a polymorphism  on binding site of AP-1 is an interesting result. AP-1 is related  to neuron synapse in regulating synaptic number and strength  [24, 25]. That is, rs4148727 determines an AP-1 promoter site,  which might have enhanced neuronal protection in ischemia, to  show weak association with NIHSS. And this result supports that  

ABCB1 may play a role in neuronal stress.  

The rs3213619 SNP was associated with hypertension in IS.  The T and C allele frequencies in rs3213619 have been reported  to be 0.969 and 0.031 in European, 0.919 and 0.081 in Chinese,  0.953 and 0.047 in Japanese, and 0.934 and 0.066 in Sub-Saharan  African, respectively. In our controls, the T and C allele frequencies  of rs3213619 were 0.947 and 0.053. The allele frequency of  rs3213619 showed no ethnic difference.  

The rs1128503 SNP was associated with dys lipid emi a in IS.  The T and C allele frequencies in rs1128503 have been reported  to be 0.451 and 0.549 in European, 0.709 and 0.291 in Chinese,  0.587 and 0.413 in Japanese, and 0.124 and 0.876 in Sub-Saharan  African, respectively. The T and C allele frequencies of rs1128503  in our control group were 0.595 and 0.405, those were similar in  Japanese population. The allele frequency of rs1128503 showed  ethnic difference.  

The rs3842 SNP showed association with development, hyper­ tension, and diabetes mellitus. The A and G allele frequencies  in the rs3842 SNP have been reported to be 0.858 and 0.142 in  European, 0.756 and 0.244 in Chinese, 0.680 and 0.320 in Japanese,  and 0.858 and 0.142 in Sub-Saharan African, respectively. The A  and G allele frequencies of rs3842 in our control group were 0.684  and 0.316, those were similar in Japanese population. The allele  frequency of rs3842 showed ethnic difference.  

The rs3213619 and rs3842 SNPs were associated with hyper­ tension in IS. rs3213619 was associated with hypertension in  co dominant 1 model (fisher’s exact   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.020$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.26$  ,   $95\%$   

  $\mathrm{CI}{=}0.07{\cdot}0.91$  ) and allele frequencies (fisher’s exact   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.024$  , 

  $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.25$  ,   $95\%$   CI=0.28-0.78). rs3842 was associated with  hypertension in co dominant 2 model (fisher’s exact   $\mathrm{p{=}}0.016$  , 

  $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.15$  ,  $95\%$   CI=0.03-0.70) and recessive model (fisher’s exact 

  $\mathrm{p{=}}0.003$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.11$  ,  $95\%$   CI=0.03-0.51). As hypertension and nonhypertension groups were already affected by stroke, we observed  that minor alleles of both rs3213619 and rs3842 SNPs might be  contributing to the risk of IS development in non-hypertensive  groups.  

Blood pressure of the study samples was measured after develop­ ment of IS. However study result may still have significance,  because poststroke BP rise is associated with prestroke BP level,  and BP of hypertensive patients are higher than non-hypertensive  patients in the first week of stroke [26]. Previous study reported  cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (CYP3A5)  and ABCB1 polymorphisms are associated with hypertension [16].  The   $3435\,\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}$  variant of ABCB1 was associated with angiotensin  stimulated aldo ster one level [27], and cy clos por in A, an ABCB1  inhibitor, influences the renin–angiotensin–aldo ster one system  [28]. These results suggest that association of ABCB1 with blood  pressure is not only mediated by exogeneous substrates such as  ACE inhibitors, and may support the association of rs3213619 and  rs3842 with hypertension.  

In recently published GWAS some of genes have been candi­ dated. PITX2 and ZNFX3 genes was confirmed to be specific  for card i oem boli c stroke [29]. NINJ2 gene showed association  with all types of strokes and ischemic stroke [30], and HDAC9  is associated with the risk of large vessel ischemic stroke [31].  However, no recent GWAS indicated the ABCB1 as risk factor  of IS. Regarding that ABCB1 mainly functions as efflux pump,  ABCB1 may not be directly related to development of IS. How­ ever, as inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin s and  leu kotri ene s are ABCB1 substrate, we hypothesized that ABCB1  functions in the BBB may contribute to tissue damaging and  severity of IS developed by ischemic origin. However, NIHSS and  MBI were not associated with the tested ABCB1 SNPs.  

In summary, we evaluated the relationships between the four  SNPs of ABCB1 (rs4148727, rs3213619, rs1128503, and rs3842)  and the development, risk factors, severity, and sequelae of IS.  And we are the first to report the association between ABCB1  SNPs and the development, hypertension, dys lipid emi a, diabetes  mellitus, and NIHSS of IS. These results suggest that ABCB1 may  be associated with IS in Korean population. Our sample size was  relatively small. Furthermore, some of subgroups in our study  included too small cases to conclude the clear association between  candidate SNPs and IS. Therefore, the suggested relationship  between tested SNPs and the clinical phenotypes of IS still need  validation study in larger samples.
