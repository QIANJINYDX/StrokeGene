Summary.  Background:  Confounding by common causes and reverse causation have been proposed as explanations for the association between high ﬁbrinogen levels and cardiovascular disease. Genetic variants can alter ﬁbrinogen characteristics and are not subject to these problems.  Objectives:  To determine the ﬁbrinogen plasma levels for genotypic variants in ﬁbrinogen $\cdot_{\mathrm{A}\upalpha}$   (FGA Thr312Ala) and ﬁbrinogen $\mathbf{\cdotB}\upbeta$   (FGB  $-\;455\mathrm{G/A})$  ), and whether these variants are associated with arterial thrombosis.  Methods:  Fibrinogen genotypes were determined in a population-based case–control study including women aged 18–50 years; 218 cases with myocardial infarction, 192 cases with ischemic stroke, and 769 healthy controls. Fibrinogen levels were determined in the control population.  Results:  The FGB  )  455G/A variant increased plasma ﬁbrinogen levels, whereas the FGA Thr312Ala variant lowered plasma ﬁbrinogen levels, albeit to a modest extent. The risk of ischemic stroke was altered when the homozygote minor allele was compared with the homozygote major allele. The FGA Thr312Ala single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with a decrease in risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.43;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.21–0.87], whereas the FGB  )  455G/A SNP might have increased the risk (OR 1.76;   $95\%$   CI 0.7–4.03). The risk of myocardial infarction was not altered for either SNP (FGA Thr312Ala, OR 0.98,   $95\%$   CI 0.40–2.40; FGB  )  455G/A, OR 0.98,  $95\%$   CI 0.40–2.40).  Conclusions:  With the genetic variations as markers of plasma ﬁbrinogen levels alterations, thereby ruling out confounding and reverse causation, our results suggest that plasma ﬁbrinogen levels could play a more pronounced role as risk factors for ischemic stroke than for myocardial infarction.

# Introduction  

Fibrinogen is an acute-phase coagulation factor produced by he pato cyte s and is activated by thrombin to form ﬁbrin monomers and polymers. It is covalently cross-linked by coagulation factor XIIIa to form ﬁbrin ﬁbers, which are the main constituents of blood clots. Fibrinogen consists of three pairs of polypeptide chains, denoted   $(\mathrm{A}\alpha/\mathrm{B}\beta/\gamma)$  , which are linked in the central domain. All three genes for these polypeptide chains are located in the ﬁbrinogen module located on the short arm of chromosome 4 [1,2].  

High ﬁbrinogen levels have been associated with cardiovascular diseases in large studies such as the Framingham study and Northwick Park Heart study, and also in meta-analyses such as the one by the Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration [3–5]. Results from the Risk of Arterial Thrombosis In relation to Oral contraceptives (RATIO) study also showed high ﬁbrinogen to be associated with myocardial infarction   $[3.5–4.5\mathrm{~g~L~}^{-1}$  vs.   $<\,2.5\ \mathrm{g\L^{-1}}$  ; odds ratio (OR) 2.1;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.2–3.6] [6].  

However, the acute-phase property of ﬁbrinogen and the associations with environmental risk factors of cardiovascular disease [e.g. smoking/oral contraceptive (OC) use] make it difﬁcult to determine whether ﬁbrinogen is a cause or a marker of increased risk of cardiovascular disease [7–9]. This question can be addressed by means of Mendelian random iz ation [10], a process that uses genetic variation as marker for lifelong exposure to altered protein levels, in this case of increased ﬁbrinogen. With these genetic variants as markers for ﬁbrinogen levels, confounding by extraneous factors and reverse causation are virtually excluded as possible explanations for the association. The genetic marker might also be in linkage d is equilibrium with another variation causing changes in the plasma ﬁbrinogen level. Common genetic variants in the ﬁbrinogen module have been associated with increased ﬁbrinogen plasma levels and can thus be used as markers of lifelong increased levels of plasma ﬁbrinogen [11,12]. This current study uses the ﬁbrinogen $\cdot\mathbf{A}\propto$   (FGA) Thr312Ala (rs6050) singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as a marker of decreased plasma ﬁbrinogen levels, and ﬁbrinogen $\mathbf{\beta}$   (FGB  )  455G/A) (rs1800790) as a marker for an increase in level.  

Recently, in spite of the associations between the FGA Thr312Ala and FGB  )  455G/A SNPs and altered levels of plasma ﬁbrinogen, no association was found for these SNPs or associated haplotypes with myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke in the CHS study [12]. Similar results were obtained earlier in the Copenhagen City study, the SMILE study, the Rotterdam study and a cross-sectional analysis of the CARDIA cohort; the genetic variations were associated with altered plasma ﬁbrinogen levels, but not with cardiovascular disease [11,13–15]. Another study, however, found an increase in venous thrombosis risk for carriers of the Bcl I    $\upbeta$  -chain ﬁbrinogen polymorphism (rs209502) [16]. This SNP is almost completely in linkage d is equilibrium with the   $\mathrm{FGB-455G/A}$  SNP (  $|D^{\prime}|\;=\;0.96$   in the ECTIM study) [17].  

The FGA Thr312Ala SNP has also been associated with a decreased risk of pulmonary embolism as well with a lower risk of poststroke mortality in patients with atrial brillat ion but not of deep vein thrombosis. These decreases in risk are not likely to be caused by increases in plasma ﬁbrinogen level, but by the changes in the mechanical properties of the clot caused by the genetic variant. The FGA Thr312Ala variant alters clot stability by affecting FXIII cross-linking, thus making carriers of the FGA Thr312 variant less prone to embo liz ation [18,19]. This study assessed the risk implications of genetic variations in the ﬁbrinogen module on arterial thrombosis in young women. We estimated the risks for carriers of the genetic variants FGA Thr312Ala and FGB  )  455G/A as markers for altered ﬁbrinogen levels for myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study design  

The RATIO study is a multi center population-based case– control study. It consists of three substudies, which included cases with myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease, and matched controls. The study was initiated to evaluate the risk of arterial thrombosis due to OCs of different generations (1990–1995) [20–22]. Blood and buccal swabs were collected during the second phase of the study, in order to study pro thr ombo tic conditions of the coagulation system (1998–2002). Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the medical ethics committees of the participating hospitals. For the current study, we used data from the myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke substudies.  

# Participants  

Patient selection has been described in detail previously [20,21,23]. In summary, we included women aged 18–50 years who presented with myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke to one of the 16 participating hospitals in the Netherlands between 1990 and 1995. Because of this age range, all women were considered to be pre menopausal. Myocardial infarction was diagnosed by the presence of clinical symptoms, elevated cardiac enzyme levels, and electrocardiograph ic changes. Clinical symptoms of ischemic stroke were conﬁrmed by either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Between 1990 and 1995, a population-based control group was approached by random digit dialing. Eligible women were aged 18–50 years and had no history of arterial thrombosis; women were frequency matched on age, area of residence, and year of event. In total, 925 of 1039 (  $89\%$   response rate) were included in the control group for the three case groups combined. A standardized questionnaire on (familial) medical history, use of OCs, smoking habits and participant characteristics was ﬁlled in by all participants. Some of these questions were targeted at the year prior to the event for cases. Controls were asked to answer these same questions for a particular year (index year) to ensure comparability. Blood or buccal swabs were collected for DNA analysis from 218 myocardial infarction cases, 190 ischemic stroke cases, and 767 controls.  

# Measurements and deﬁnitions  

DNA was isolated from   $10~\mathrm{mL}$   of EDTA-augmented blood or buccal swabs and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction. Two SNPs, in FGA (FGA Thr312Ala, rs6050) and FGB (FGA  $-\ 455\mathrm{G/A}$  , rs1800790), were genotyped with the   $5^{\prime}$  -nuclease/ Taqman Assay [24]. Polymerase chain reactions based on ﬂuorescent allele-speciﬁc oli go nucleotide probes (assay-bydesign/assay-on-demand; Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) were performed on a PE9700 thermal cycler (Biozym, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany), and u or esc en ce endpoint reading for allelic discrimination was performed on an ABI   $7900~\mathrm{HT}$   (Applied Biosystems). Primers and probe sequence are available upon request. During genotyping, technicians were unaware of outcome status. Fibrinogen in the control population was determined according to Von Clauss, using the reagents of Behring werke AG (Marburg, Germany).  

# Statistical analysis  

Logistic regression was used to obtain ORs as measures of rate ratios and accompanying  $95\%$   CIs for the relationship between genetic variants in the ﬁbrinogen gene and arterial thrombosis. ORs were adjusted for the three strat i cation variables age (as a continuous variable), area of residence, and year of event. Differences in ﬁbrinogen plasma levels and corresponding  $95\%$   CIs were calculated per genotype. Expected relative risks corresponding the observed ﬁbrinogen differences were based on hazard ratios from a meta-analysis [5]. For all analyses, the homozygote carriers of the major allele were used as the reference group. Women with missing data were excluded from analysis when appropriate.  

# Results  

Study participants  

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study participants. The ages of the myocardial infarction patients ranged from 25 to 51 years, those of the ischemic stroke patients from 18 to 50 years, and those of controls from 18 to 53 years. Known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyper lipid emi a, were more prevalent in both case groups than in controls. A larger proportion of patients than of controls were smokers.  

The overall call rate of the genotyping was   $97\%$   for the two SNPs, and the success rate was irrespective of case–control status. The allele frequencies of the variants were 0.31 for FGA

All data are with respect to the year of event (cases) or index date (controls). Data are missing on ethnicity for one ischemic stroke (IS) case and four controls, on history of hypertension for four controls, on history of diabetes mellitus for one myocardial infarction (MI) case and three controls, on hyper lipid emi a for one MI case and ﬁve controls, on oral contraceptive use for six controls, on smoking for six controls, and on alcohol use for one IS case and six controls.

Thr312Ala and 0.19 for   $\mathrm{FGB\mathrm{~-~}}455\mathrm{G/A}$  . The likelihood of departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was determined in the control population, and was    $P\,=\,0.043$   for FGA Thr312Ala and    $P\,=\,0.84$   for   $\mathrm{FGB-455G/A}$  .  

# Genetic variants and ﬁbrinogen plasma levels  

Plasma ﬁbrinogen levels were available for 602 control women. The mean ﬁbrinogen level in this population was   $3.20~\mathrm{g~L^{-1}}$  . The plasma ﬁbrinogen levels per genotype as well as the associated expected relative risks are shown in Table 2. Levels were lower in carriers of the   $\mathrm{FGA}\ -455\mathrm{G/A}$   variant  $(3.15\mathrm{~g~L~}^{-1}$    for carriers vs.   $3.24~\mathrm{g~L^{-1}}$    for non-carriers,  $95\%$   CI of difference  $-~0.20$   to  $0.02\mathrm{g~L^{-1}}$  ). Levels were higher for carriers of the FGB Thr312Ala variant   $(3.32\ \mathrm{g\L^{-1}}$    for carriers vs.   $3.13\ \mathrm{g\L^{-1}}$    for non-carriers,   $95\%$   CI of difference  $0.07{-}0.30\mathrm{~g~L^{-1}}$  ).  

Genotype analyses  

The genotype distribution among case groups and controls, as well as the risk per genotype with the homozygote major allele genotype as reference, are shown in Table 3. After adjustment for the strat i cation variables, no effect on myocardial risk was observed for the FGA Thr312Ala variant (OR 0.82;   $95\%$   CI

 0.49–1.39) but a decreased risk was found for ischemic stroke

 (OR 0.43;   $95\%$   CI 0.21–0.87) when the homozygote minor allele genotype was compared with the homozygote major allele genotype. The homozygote carriers of the   $\mathrm{FGB-455G/}$  A variant also showed no altered risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.98;  $95\%$   CI 0.40–2.40). If anything, the risk of ischemic stroke was increased (OR 1.76;   $95\%$   CI 0.77–4.03). No substantial effect on myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke was observed for heterozygotes when compared with those with the homozygote major alleles for either the FGA Thr312Ala SNP or the FGB  )  455G/A SNP.  

The results of this per-genotype analysis are consistent with the risks when one assumes a recessive inheritance pattern: The

Data are mean (standard deviation). Fibrinogen was measured in 602 control women. The expected relative risk (RR) was calculated on the basis of the hazard ratio (HR) per increase of ﬁbrinogen plasma level of   $1\ \mathrm{g\L^{-1}}$    for (non)-fatal coronary heart disease [i.e. HR 2.93;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval (CI) 2.59–3.31] and (non)-fatal stroke (i.e. HR 2.77;  $95\%$   CI 2.17–3.53) for ages 40–59 years reported by the Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration [5].

Percentages might not add up to  $100\%$  , because of rounding. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) determination was either unsuccessful or ambiguous in seven control women, one myocardial infarction (MI) case and seven ischemic stroke (IS) cases for the ﬁbrinogen $\cdot_{\mathrm{A}\upalpha}$   (FGA) Thr312Ala SNP. The ﬁbrinogen $\mathbf{\cdotB}\upbeta$   (FGB)  )  455G/A SNP determination did not succeed in 34 controls, six MI cases and weight IS cases. ORs were calculated per genotype, with the homozygote major allele genotype as reference, and are adjusted for matching factors (i.e. age, area of residence, and year of event).  

homozygote minor allele genotype of the FGA Thr312Ala SNP, when compared with the homozygote major allele genotype combined with the heterozygote genotype, lowered the risk of ischemic stroke (OR 0.43;  $95\%$   CI 0.21–0.85), but not of myocardial infarction   $\mathrm{{OR}~0.91}$  ;   $95\%$   CI 0.55–1.53). The homozygote minor allele genotype of the FGB  )  455G/A SNP tended to elevate the risk of ischemic stroke (OR 1.84;  $95\%$   CI 0.81–4.19) but not of myocardial infarction (OR 0.94;   $95\%$   CI  $0.39{-}2.29)$   when compared with the homozygote major allele and heterozygote genotype combined. A dominant inheritance pattern diluted all effects; no substantial effect of the FGA Thr312Ala SNP was observed on myocardial infarction (OR 0.77;  $95\%$   CI   $0.56{-}1.07)$   or on ischemic stroke (OR 0.86;   $95\%$   CI 0.60–1.22). The FGB  $-\455\mathrm{G/A}$   SNP also showed no effect on either myocardial infarction (OR 1.13;   $95\%$   CI 1.13–1.58) or ischemic stroke (OR 0.94;  $95\%$   CI 0.64–1.37).  

# Smoking and OC use  

OC use in the year of the event increased the crude risk of arterial thrombosis two-fold to three-fold (OR 2.3,   $95\%$   CI 1.6–3.3, for myocardial infarction; OR 2.6,  $95\%$   CI 1.7–3.9, for ischemic stroke). Smoking in the year prior to the event also increased arterial thrombotic risk (OR 7.1,  $95\%$   CI 4.7–10.7, for myocardial infarction; OR 2.2,   $95\%$   CI 1.6–3.3, for ischemic stroke). These effects showed no marked interaction with the effects of the SNPs (data not shown).  

# Discussion  

We used two genetic variants in the ﬁbrinogen module as markers of decreased (FGA Thr312Ala) and increased (FGB  $-\455\mathrm{G/A})$   plasma ﬁbrinogen levels. We found that the effects of these SNPs on ﬁbrinogen levels in our control population were according to the literature, albeit to a modest extent.  

Both genetic variant SNPs as markers of altered ﬁbrinogen levels also altered the risk the risk of ischemic stroke in the expected direction; FGA Thr312Ala decreased the risk twofold (OR 0.43;   $95\%$   CI 0.21–0.87), and FGB  )  455G/A possibly increased this risk (OR 1.76;   $95\%$   CI 0.77–4.03). Neither SNP affected the risk of myocardial infarction. These altered risks were greatest in the per-genotype analysis, with similar results being obtained, assuming a recessive inheritance pattern. Smoking and the use of OCs, both established risk factors for arterial thrombosis and related to increased ﬁbrinogen, increased the risk of both myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, but showed no marked interaction with the FGA Thr312Ala and FGB  )  455G/A SNPs, possibly because of lack of power.  

We used the process of Mendelian random iz ation to rule out any confounding by environmental factors and to ascertain whether the role of ﬁbrinogen is a cause or a consequence. For this process, it is necessary to establish the relationship between genetic variants and plasma ﬁbrinogen level, either from the literature or in the control population; both the FGA Thr312Ala and FGB  )  455G/A SNPs have been found to alter ﬁbrinogen plasma levels [11,13,14,19,25,26]. We showed similar effects of the genetic variants in our control population, albeit to a modest extent. The expected increase in risk based on the increase in ﬁbrinogen levels associated with these genetic variants is  $4–49\%$  , which is lower than the increase in risk that we established. These calculations are based on the hazard ratios from the meta-analysis by the Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration, focusing on coronary heart disease and stroke in the age group 40–59 years [5]. This meta-analysis also includes studies with participants aged 18–90 years, with an emphasis on the elderly. The effect of ﬁbrinogen on the risk of arterial thrombosis is larger in the young, which might explain why the effect was larger in the young women (18–53 years of age) in our study.  

This fair-sized population-based case–control study for young women with arterial thrombosis provides a unique opportunity to determine (genetic) risk factors for this speciﬁc group that may be indicative of risk factors in older age categories. Nonetheless, our subgroup analyses (i.e. smoking and OC use analyses) had limited numbers for some subgroups. For this reason, we chose to use a dominant inheritance pattern. The dilution of effect that is observed in the risk analysis with a dominant inheritance pattern could therefore also affect these subgroup analyses. However, numbers were limited and strong conclusions cannot be drawn. We can therefore only conclude that there is no evidence for a strong interaction between the environmental factors and genetic variants.  

The control population can be considered not to be in HWE because a    $P_{-}$  -value of 0.043 was calculated for the FGA Thr312Ala SNP. As our controls were sampled from the entire Netherlands through random digit dialing, we consider this slight deviation of the HWE to be probably due to chance. We chose to study two SNPs in the ﬁbrinogen module that are known to be associated with altered ﬁbrinogen levels. It is possible that these SNPs are causal for this change in plasma level, but they could also be in linkage with other genetic traits that inﬂuence ﬁbrinogen levels (e.g. Bcl I    $\upbeta$  -chain ﬁbrinogen polymorphism). These other traits could potentially affect the plasma ﬁbrinogen levels, thus still leaving our SNPs as proper markers of lifelong exposure to altered ﬁbrinogen levels. The used SNPs could also be in linkage with genetic variations that result in functionally different ﬁbrinogen and thus affect the risk not via altered plasma ﬁbrinogen levels. This might be the case for the FGA Thr312Ala SNP. It has been negatively associated with venous thr ombo embolism, pulmonary embolism and poststroke mortality in patients with atrial brillat ion and ischemic stroke [18,19,26,27]. This increase in risk might be caused by the changed characteristics of the ﬁbrin ﬁbers, which make the clot more prone to embo liz ation [19]. This increase in risk is in contrast with our results. But as the stroke cases included in our study are primarily of non-cardiac origin, we feel that the FGA Thr312Ala variation is a marker not of decreased disposition to embo liz ation but primarily of lower ﬁbrinogen plasma levels. Nevertheless, conclusions based on the FGA Thr312 results should be drawn cautiously.  

The large individual-participant meta-analysis by the Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration showed a similar increase in risk for all major cardiovascular diseases, including non-fatal ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. The difference between our results (different effects of ﬁbrinogen on the risks of different manifestations of arterial thrombosis) and those of the Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration (similar effects of ﬁbrinogen on the risks of those manifestations) might be due to confounding and reverse causation, problems that are resolved by the use of Mendelian random iz ation in our study. Earlier studies with the same approach also showed an association of the FGB  )  455G/A SNP and increased plasma ﬁbrinogen levels, but failed to show an association with myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke [12–14,26,28]. These studies mainly included middle-aged to old subjects, in contrast to our young female population: the older age, and hence more developed stage of atherosclerosis, of the previously studied populations might explain why no direct relationship between the genetic variants and arterial thrombosis were found. If it is present at all, we hypothesize that our cases have minimal latestage atherosclerosis, because of their young age; only   $11\%$   of the myocardial infarction cases and   $8\%$   of the ischemic stroke cases were reported to be diagnosed with hyper lipid emi a at the time of the event. Fibrinogen levels and other coagulation factors might therefore play a more pronounced role in arterial thrombosis in the young than in the old, either as a direct causal factor for thrombosis or a strong cofactor in thrombosis initiated by sub clinical atherosclerosis. This may be even more the case for the development of ischemic stroke than for myocardial infarction.  

Because of the use of a detailed questionnaire in the ﬁrst phase of this case–control study, we were able to include only survivors of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke; fatal events could not be included, possibly leading to a survivor bias. Even if there is a difference between the etiologies of fatal and non-fatal arterial thrombosis, we hypothesize that the effect of ﬁbrinogen, or any other risk factor, is more pronounced in the fatal events. If our study is affected by this survivor bias, we thus conclude that it underestimates the true effect of ﬁbrinogen on arterial thrombosis.  

In conclusion, this study showed an association between the FGA Thr312Ala SNP and a decreased risk of ischemic stroke. If anything, the FGB  )  455G/A SNP was associated with an increase in risk. The direction of the effects is in accordance with the effects of the two SNPs on plasma ﬁbrinogen levels. Neither SNP affected the risk of myocardial infarction. The FGA Thr312Ala SNP could also be a marker of altered clot characteristics, and the effect of the FGB  ) 455G/A SNP has not been established ﬁrmly, which makes the interpretation of the increased risk associated with this variant difﬁcult. Taking survivor bias into account, as well as the non-cardiac origin of the ischemic stroke included in this study and the fact that the SNPs used in this study are proper markers of altered ﬁbrinogen levels, we conclude that ﬁbrinogen probably plays a causal role in the development of arterial thrombosis, especially ischemic stroke, in young women.
