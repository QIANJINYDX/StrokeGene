Abstract Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 4 (TNFSF4) plays a key role in the process of atherosclerosis, a common risk factor for both myocardial and cerebral infarction s. Recent studies indicate that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3850641 in TNFSF4 is associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction, but little is known about the association between TNFSF4 variation and cerebral infarction (CI). A case-control study involving  $385\;\mathrm{CI}$  patients and 385 age-matched, sex-matched non-CI controls was conducted in a Chinese population, only the most common subtype, atherosclerosis CI, was recruited. Two SNPs of TNFSF4, rs3850641 and rs3861950, were genotyped by the TaqMan SNP genotyping method, and veriﬁed partly by genomic DNA sequencing. The results revealed a signiﬁcant allelic association between rs3861950 and CI (Odds ration  $=1.733$  ,   $95~\%$   conﬁdence interval  $=$  1.333–2.254,    $P=0.000)$  ). Genotypic association analysis demonstrated that the CC genotype of rs3861950 confers susceptibility to CI (Odds ration  $=2.896$  ,  $95~\%$   conﬁdence interval  $=1.368–6.132)$  ), and it was associated with a signiﬁcantly higher risk of ischemic stroke (Odds ration  $=$  3.520,  $95~\%$  conﬁdence interval  $=1.546–8.015$  ,  $P=$  0.003) after adjusting for the other conﬁrmed risk factors such as the history of hypertension, diabetes, CAD, smoking and alcohol drinking. While the odds ratio of the T allele to the C allele was 1.733 (  $95~\%$  conﬁdence interval:  

1.333–2.254). However, there was no signiﬁcant association between rs3850641 and CI (Odds ration  $=1.288$  ,   $95~\%$  conﬁdence interval $=0.993–1.670$ ,  $P=0.056)$ ). TNFSF4gene polymorphism rs3861950, but not rs3850641, is associated with the risk of atherosclerosis CI in a Chinese population.

# Introduction  

Cerebral infarction (CI) is a heterogeneous condition with a wide spectrum of underlying causes, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a, vasculitis, and atherosclerosis. There is evidence from family and twin studies that genetic factors play an important role in the pathogen es is of athero sclerosis and CI [ 1 ,  2 ]. Although the mode of genetic transmission of the disorder is widely believed to be multifactorial, few candidate genes have been established [ 1 – 3 ]. Recent studies indicated that several members of tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) gene involve in the at hero sclerotic process [ 4 – 10 ], of which the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3850641 in tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 4 (TNFSF4) is believed to be sign i cant ly associated with the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) [ 11 ,  12 ]. Although atherosclerosis is the common risk factor for both MI and CI, data from Olofsson et al. [ 13 ] show no evidence for an association of the rs3850641 SNP in TNFSF4 with the risk for CI. Moreover, three recent studies [ 14 – 16 ] show no relationship between the rs3850641 SNP in TNFSF4 and MI and coronary artery disease (CAD). Thus, it is important to clarify whether the TNFSF4 gene polymorphism is associated with the risk of CI.  

TNFSF4 (also called OX40L) is located at 1q25 and is expressed on activated B cells, endo the li al cells, macrophages and some activated T cells. OX40L interacts with its receptor OX40 (CD134), which is expressed on activated T cells. OX40/OX40L is considered to be a co-stimulator of T cell and has been reported to be involved in in amma tory reaction diseases [ 12 ,  17 ]. Wang et al. [ 11 ] found that genetic variant in the OX40L locus, an SNP located at intron 1 (rs3850641), was associated with MI and severity of CAD in human, and TNFSF4 mRNA levels were sign i cant ly higher in human at hero sclerotic lesions compared with controls. However, little is known about the role of TNFSF4 gene polymorphisms in CI. It is plausible that non-synonymous SNPs have a major inﬂuence on gene function by introducing amino acid changes in their corresponding proteins. However, more and more attention is paid to the other types of SNPs, which could affect the functions of the gene from their own ways. For example, the synonymous SNP could modify the secondary structure of mRNA or translational processing; the introns SNP could affect the activity of splicing sites, while the regulatory region SNP might regulate promoter elements, rather than changing the coded amino acid sequence. The aim of this study is to further evaluate the association between the SNPs rs3861950 and rs3850641 of the TNFSF4 (both are located in introns of the gene) and the risk of CI in Chinese patients.  

Subjects and methods  

Subject  

This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Central South University. All study participants donated blood samples for DNA analysis and biochemical measurements by written informed consent. Patient group was comprised of 385 unrelated Chinese CI patients (246 male and 139 female) with the ages ranging from 31 to 86 years old (mean age,   $60.6\pm11.8$   years). These CI patients were admitted to the Department of Neurology, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from June 2007 to September 2011. All of them were registered by uniform questionnaire. The CI cases were diagnosed and conﬁrmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), cardiac color ultrasound and were adjudicated by no less than two neurologists. The stroke subtypes were classiﬁed according to the methods of Adams et al. [ 18 ] and Han et al. [ 19 ], and only the most common subtype, atherosclerosis cerebral infarction, was recruited. Patients with card i oem boli c and arterial dissection related stroke were excluded; patients with CI caused by cardiac arrhythmia, arteritis, traumatism, he mato path y, medication, tumor, cerebrovascular malformation, and aneurysm were excluded; patients with hemorrhagic infarct, liver and kidney dysfunction, auto-immune disease, cyesis and other unknown reasons were excluded as well. Control individuals were recruited from the health examination center of Xiangya hospital at the same period of time. This group was consisted of 385 individuals age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (237 male and 148 female), with the ages ranging from 36 to 86 years old (mean age,   $59.5\pm11.5$   years). Those with history of cerebro vascular disease, family history of stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, he mato logic disease, endocrine, metabolic disorders and cyesis were excluded out of the control group. There is no signiﬁcant differences in age, sex, and body mass index (BMI,   $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}.$  ) between patient group and control group   $(P>0.05)$  .  

Genomic DNA  

Genomic DNA from nucleated cells of patients and controls was extracted from EDTA peripheral blood using a DNA blood kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  

Single nucleotide polymorphism selection  

On the basis of the Genetic sequence database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser database, we identiﬁed two common SNPs: rs3861950 and rs3850641, and the associated primers and probes are designed by using Primer Express Software (Table  1 ).  

Genotyping by genomic DNA sequencing  

To validate the accuracy of the TaqMan allele discriminatory analysis technology and to avoid the false positive results, 150 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were selected randomly and directly sequenced forward and reverse using the primers shown in Table  2 . The PCR products were sequenced by ABI3100 sequencer.  

Genotyping by TaqMan PCR assay  

Sequences of allele-speciﬁc TaqMan MGB probes and primers were used in the TaqMan PCR assay. These assays were designed for the allelic discrimination of speciﬁc SNPs. The primers and probes sequences for the polymorphisms were shown in Table  1 , which were synthesized by Shanghai Gene Core Bio Technologies Company. No-template controls with no DNA in the reaction were

used as the criteria for the u or esc en ce level due to an unclear probe. TaqMan PCR and the genotyping analysis were performed on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT PCR System (America) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The reaction mixtures were ampliﬁed in  $1~{\upmu\mathrm{L}}$   of genomic DNA   $(10~\mathrm{ng}/\upmu\mathrm{L})$   or  $1~{\upmu\mathrm{L}}$   of 100-fold-diluted PCR products,   $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of   $2\times$   TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems),   $0.5~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of   $40~\times$   primer/probe mix, and  $8.5~\mathrm{{\muL}}$   of ddH2O in a volume of   $20~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  . PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at  $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $12~\mathrm{min}$  , and 40 cycles at  $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 3 s,  $59\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $45~\mathrm{s},72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}$  , at last   $72\ ^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   for  $5~\mathrm{min}$  , then stored them at  $4~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , away from light. The results were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT PCR System (America) using an allelic discri mi nation assay program.  

Statistical analysis  

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0. Mean values of cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein in different groups were compared using Student’s    $t$   test analysis, Mann–Whitney    $U_{-}$  -test analysis. The frequencies of alleles and genotypes between the study groups, which were analyzed by the    $\chi^{2}$    analysis, were in accordance with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium law, so the samples can stand for the population. The latent impacts of SNPs as well as the history of hypertension, diabetes, CAD, smoking and alcohol drinking on the relatives of ischemic stroke were determined using bivariate non-condition logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios and  $95~\%$   conﬁdence intervals   $.95~\%$   conﬁdence interval) were determined by Pearson’s    $\chi^{2}$  -test.    $P$  -values less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.  

# Results  

# Characteristics of subjects  

Table  3  showed the clinical characteristics of CI patients and control subjects. There were no signiﬁcant differences in age, sex, triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) between patient and control groups (  $\textstyle P>0.05)$  . The history of smoking and alcohol drinking, CAD, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension were more commonly observed in CI patients than those in control subjects  $(P<0.01)$  ). Notably, the conventional risk factors including vascular disease, blood sugar (BS) and total cholesterol (TCho) were sign i cant ly higher in controls than those in patient group   $(P<0.01\$  ).  

Genotyping by genomic DNA sequencing  

Correlation studies using DNA sequencing as the gold standard showed that all of the 150 samples genotypes which were selected randomly agree quite well with the sequencing result, revealing that TaqMan PCR technique was highly reproducible with good sensitivity and speciﬁcity.  

# Distribution of TNFSF4 gene polymorphisms  

The genotype distribution and the allelic frequencies for TNFSF4 gene polymorphisms (rs3850641 and rs3861950) are summarized in Table  4 . The distributions of genotype frequencies of the two SNP-sites were in accordance with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium expectations since    $P$   value is more than 0.05 in both the control and patient groups.

As shown in Table  4 , the  $\mathbf{C}$   and  $\mathrm{T}$   allelic frequencies of rs3861950 in the CI patients were 22.6 and   $77.4\ \%$  , respectively. The frequencies of three genotypes were  $6.7\ \%$   (C/C),  $31.6\ \%$   (C/T) and  $61.6\ \%$   (T/T). In the control group, the C and T allelic frequencies were 14.4 and  $85.6\ \%$   respectively, and the frequencies of the three genotypes were  $2.6\ \%$   (C/C),  $23.6\ \%$   (C/T), and  $73.8\ \%$   (T/T).  

The A and the   $\mathbf{G}$   allelic frequencies of rs3850641 in the CI patients were 83.6 and   $16.4~\%$  , respectively, and the frequencies of three genotypes were   $70.1\ \%$   (A/A),   $27.0\ \%$  (A/G), and   $2.9\ \%$   (G/G). In the control group, the frequencies of the three genotypes were   $64.7~\%$   (A/A),  $30.4~\%$   (A/G), and   $4.9\ \%$   (G/G), and the A and   $\mathbf{G}$   allelic frequencies were 79.9 and  $20.1\ \%$   respectively.  

The distribution of genotypes   $(\chi^{2}=15.864$  ,  $P=0.000)$  ) and allelic frequencies   $(\chi^{2}=17.089$  ,    $P=0.000)$  ) of the rs3861950 gene polymorphism between   $\mathrm{CI}$   and control groups were sign i cant ly different. The CC genotype increased the risk of CI with an odds ratio of 2.896 (  $95~\%$  conﬁdence interval: 1.368–6.132), and the odds ratio of the T allele to the C allele was 1.733 (  $95~\%$   conﬁdence interval: 1.333–2.254). We also examined the distribution of genotypes   $(\chi^{2}=3.748$  ,  $P=0.154>0.05)$  ) and allelic frequencies   $(\chi^{2}=3.661$  ,    $P=0.056>0.05)$   of the rs3850641 and found no signiﬁcant association with ischemic stroke (Table  4 ).  

Based on the result we mentioned above, we investigated the possible association of the rs3861950 polymorphism

with the risk factors of CI. Table  5  showed the results of bivariate non-condition logistic regression analysis. After adjusting for the other conﬁrmed risk factors such as the historyof hypertension, diabetes, CAD, smoking and alcohol drinking, the CC genotype of rs3861950 was associated with a sign i cant ly higher risk of ischemic stroke   $(\mathrm{OR}=3.52$  ,  $95~\%$   conﬁdence interval: 1.546–8.015,    $P=0.003)$  ). Fur- thermore, the history of hypertension (both    ${<}5$   years and

  ${>}5$   years), diabetes   ${\left({>}5\right)}$   years), CAD (both    ${<}5$   years and

  ${>}5$   years), smoking excessively and drinking excessively were also the risk factors for ischemic stroke (Table  5 ). However, drinking occasionally decreased the risk of ischemic stroke (  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.520$  ,   $95~\%$   conﬁdence interval: 0.320–0.846,  $P=0.009)$  ). Similar to the result of    $\chi^{2}.$  -test, bivariate non-condition logistic regression analysis shows no relationship between the rs3850641 and the risk of ischemic stroke (data not shown).  

# Discussion  

In this study, we used the TaqMan PCR assay based on allele-speciﬁc probes to examine the relationship between the TNFSF4 gene variation and the risk of CI. This technique combines the amp li cation and detection steps and requires no post-PCR processing, resulting in an easy to use and a high-throughput operation of the TaqMan PCR assay. Despite its high accuracy, this method is effective only for mutations that are already known. The TaqMan PCR assay presented in this study can offer a complementary and con rm at ive test with sequencing.  

Atherosclerosis is an important pathogen es is process for CI. There is evidence that TNFRSF4-TNFSF4 signaling pathway is involved in T cells activation, survival, and the interaction between activated T cells and endo the li al cells [ 12 ,  17 ], indicating that TNFSF4 gene plays an important role in the at hero sclerotic process. In mice, TNFSF4 expression is associated with increased atherosclerosis. In some independent human cohorts [ 11 ,  20 ,  21 ], the minor allele of SNP rs3850641 in TNFSF4 is sign i cant ly more frequent in patients with myocardial infarction than in control group. These studies strongly suggested that genes involved in the TNFRSF4-TNFSF4 pathway play a role in the pathogen es is of CI.  

In the present study, we detect three different gene polymorphic patterns in the TNFSF4-SNP rs3850641 and rs3861950 respectively. The distribution tendency of A/G alleles of SNP rs3850641 in Chinese Han population in Hunan is 0.799/0.201 and the C/T alleles of SNP rs3861950 is 0.144/0.856, both of them are consistent with the previous ﬁndings in Asian Chinese and Japanese, according to the database of SNPs on the website of national center for biotechnology information (NCBI SNP ID:3850641; NCBI SNP ID:3861950).  

The present study shows that the SNP rs3861950, which locates in the second intron prior to the third exon of the TNFSF4 gene and adjoins to the third exon, exists in Hunan Han population and its frequency distribution in normal individuals is similar to that of normal Asians [ 17 ]. In a gene-based association study, Cheng et al. [ 16 ] showed no signiﬁcant association between the TNFSF4 polymorphisms (ﬁve SNPs including rs3861950). In addition, the stratiﬁed analysis of genotypic and allelic frequencies showed no association between the ﬁve SNPs polymorphism and CAD [ 16 ]. Interestingly, in our study, the distribution tendency of genotypes was sign i cant ly different between CI and control group. The frequencies of CC genotype and C allelic frequency were sign i cant ly higher in CI compared with the control group, suggesting that rs3861950 is associated with the risk of CI in Hunan Han population. It is probably due to abnormal splicing site leading to the positive result of the rs3861950 with CI. Notably, all participants in the control group are candidates for the routine examinations, and those with hypertension, diabetes, or even CAD were also recruited. This maybe affect the results, and if these subjects were excluded the difference between CI and control groups may be more obvious because of similar vascular pathology between CAD and CI. This interpretation was supported by bivariate non-condition logistic regression analysis, which showed a relationship between CI and the history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease histories, smoking, or alcohol drinking in those with rs3861950 CC genotype (Table  5 ), which was 3.52 times higher than other risk factors in the risk contributing to the incidence of CI, and drinking occasionally presents a protective factor by the way.  

Chen et al. [ 15 ] demonstrated that the plasma soluble OX40L level was sign i cant ly higher in CAD patients. Although we did not determine the concentration of soluble OX40L and then investigate the relationship between genotypes of the TNFSF4 rs3861950 C/T polymorphism and plasma soluble OX40L level, we presumed that rs3861950 C/T may increase the susceptibility of CI via regulating the gene function of TNFSF4, increasing the plasma soluble OX40L level, and facilitating atherosclerosis. Together, our results suggest that in Chinese patients with CI, rs3861950 C/T SNP is probably responsible for the mutable site of TNFSF4 gene and then contributes to CI.  

With respect to the SNP rs3850641 of the TNFSF4 gene, we failed to show that it was associated with the risk of CI in the Chinese Han population. In contrast, The G allele carriers had a lower occurrence rate for CI group when compared to the control group. Bivariate non-condition logistic regression analysis showed that SNP rs3850641 had little association with CI, consistent with ﬁndings in other Asians [ 17 ]. Similar to the study in Sweden, in which Olofsson et al. [ 13 ] showed that TNFSF4 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells in human carotid at hero sclerotic lesions but provides no evidence for an association of TNFSF4 gene variation with the risk for ischemic stroke, we conclude that the rs3850641 SNP is not associated with the risk for ischemic stroke. MI and ischemic stroke share many common features in terms of the developing athero sclerotic lesion, but they are two different diseases; they precipitated on different vascular beds, which at least own their different vascular sizes and ﬂow rates. Furthermore, there are more pathogenic factors involved in ischemic stroke than MI. Perhaps we should have divided CI into several subtypes, such as large-artery atherosclerosis, small-artery occlusion, and other determined or undetermined etiologies. Human TNFSF4 gene plays an important role in the at hero sclerotic process and the minor allele of SNP rs3850641 was sign i cant ly associated with myocardial infarction [ 11 ], which is frequently arises as the result of an occluding thrombus at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic lesion. Since cerebral infarction, to a large extent, precipitated by emboli from a ruptured at hero sclerotic, we may presume that the small-artery occlusion subtype with pathology of atherosclerosis in arterial trunk of perforating branches would have a relation to SNP rs3850641 in a way. In conclusion, our data suggest that TNFSF4 gene polymorphism rs3861950, but not rs3850641 is associated with the risk of CI in a Chinese population.
