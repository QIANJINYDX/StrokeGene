Objective:  We have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to ischemic stroke. Methods:  A total of 6341 individuals from three independent populations was examined. Subject panel A comprised 131 individuals with ischemic stroke and 135 controls; subject panel B comprised 790 individuals with ischemic stroke and 3435 controls; and subject panel C comprised 71 individuals with ischemic stroke and 1779 controls. A GWAS for ischemic stroke was performed in subject panel A with the use of the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set (Affymetrix). Results:  The relation of 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected by the GWAS to ischemic stroke was examined in 705 subjects with ischemic stroke and 3426 controls selected from subject panel B. Three SNPs (rs1671021 of  LLGL2 , rs9615362 of  CELSR1 , and rs753307 of  RUVBL2 ) were sign i cant ly  $\left(P\!<\!0.05\right)$   associated with ischemic stroke. After DNA sequencing of linkage d is equilibrium blocks containing these SNPs, three tag SNPs (rs6007897 of  CELSR1 , rs1671021 of  LLGL2 , and rs1062708 of  RUVBL2 ) and a non synonymous SNP (rs4044210 of  CELSR1 ) were examined for their relation to ischemic stroke in subject panels B and C. Both rs6007897 (  $\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$  , Thr2268Ala) and rs4044210 (  $\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$  , Ile2107Val) of CELSR1  as well as rs1671021   $\mathsf{T}\to\mathsf{C}$  , Phe479Leu) of  LLGL2  were sign i cant ly associated with ischemic stroke in subject panel B. The rs6007897 and rs4044210 polymorphisms of  CELSR1  were also sign i cant ly associated with ischemic stroke in subject panel C. Conclusion: CELSR1  is a susceptibility gene for ischemic stroke in Japanese individuals, although the functional relevance of the identiﬁed SNPs was not determined.

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke is a complex multi factorial disorder that is thought to result from an interaction between a person’s genetic background and various environmental factors. It is a common and serious condition, with about 780,000 individuals having experienced a new or recurrent stroke and 150,000 deaths having occurred from stroke-related causes in the United States in 2004. The prevalence of stroke in the United States is about 5.8 million. Of all such events,  $87\%$   are ischemic stroke,   $10\%$   are intra cerebral hemorrhage, and  $3\%$   are sub ara ch noid hemorrhage  [1] . In Japan, the prevalence of stroke is about 1.4 million (  $.61\%$   ischemic stroke,   $25\%$   intracerebral hemorrhage,   $11\%$   sub ara ch noid hemorrhage,   $3\%$   others), with nearly 133,000 deaths having occurred from this condition in 2005 (Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan). Despite recent advances in acute stroke therapy, stroke remains the leading cause of severe disability and the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer, in Western countries and Japan  [2] . The identiﬁcation of biomarkers for stroke risk is important both for risk prediction and for intervention to avert future events.  

Although genetic epidemiological studies have implicated several genetic variants as risk factors for ischemic stroke  [3–6] , the genetic determinants of this condition remain largely unknown. We have now performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for ischemic stroke with    ${\sim}520{,}000$   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a total of 6341 Japanese individuals. The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to ischemic stroke and thereby to contribute to the personalized prevention of this condition.  

# 2. Methods  

# 2.1. Study subjects  

A total of 6341 individuals (992 subjects with ischemic stroke and 5349 controls) from three independent populations was examined. Subject panel A comprised 266 individuals (131 subjects with ischemic stroke and 135 controls) who either visited outpatient clinics of or were admitted to participating hospitals (Gifu Prefectural General Medical Center and Gifu Prefectural Tajimi Hospital) between October 2002 and March 2004 because of various symptoms or for an annual health checkup. Subject panel B comprised 4225 individuals (790 subjects with ischemic stroke and 3435 controls) who either visited outpatient clinics of or were admitted to participating hospitals (Gifu Prefectural General Medical Center, Gifu Prefectural Tajimi Hospital, Yokohama General Hospital, Hirosaki University Hospital, Reimeikyo Rehabilitation Hospital, Hirosaki Stroke Center, and Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital) between October 2002 and March 2008 because of various symptoms or for an annual health checkup. Subject panel C comprised 1850 community-dwelling individuals, including 71 subjects with a history of ischemic stroke and 1779 controls, who were recruited to a population-based prospective cohort study of aging and age-related diseases in Gunma Prefecture and Tokyo. The diagnosis of ischemic stroke was based on the occurrence of a new and abrupt focal neurological deﬁcit, with neurological symptoms and signs persisting for more than   $24\,\mathrm{h}$  ; it was conﬁrmed by positive ﬁndings in computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (or both) of the head. The type of stroke was determined according to the Class i cation of Cerebro vas cular Diseases III  [7] . Individuals with car dio geni c embolic infarction, lacunar infarction alone, transient ischemic attack, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction or hemorrhagic stroke, cerebro vascular malformations, moyamoya disease, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, brain tumors, or traumatic cerebro vascular diseases were excluded from the study, as were those with atrial brillat ion in the absence or presence of valvular heart disease. The control subjects were recruited from consecutive individuals who visited outpatient clinics of the participating hospitals for an annual health checkup or who were community-dwelling individuals recruited to the prospective cohort study. The absence of stroke history was evaluated by a detailed questionnaire and was conﬁrmed by the absence of a history of neurological deﬁcit. They either had or did not have conventional risk factors for stroke, including hypertension (systolic blood pressure of    $_{\geq140\,\mathrm{mmHg}}$  , diastolic blood pressure of  ${\geq}90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$  , or taking of anti hypertensive medication), diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose concentration of    $\geq\!7.00\,\mathrm{mmol/L},$  , hemoglobin   $\mathsf{A}_{1\mathsf{c}}$   content of    ${\ge}6.5\%$  , or taking of anti diabetes medication), or hypercholesterolemia (serum total cholesterol concentration of  $\dot{\geq}5.72\,\mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{l}$  L or taking of lipid-lowering medication). These subjects also had no history of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or other cerebral diseases; coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, or other at hero sclerotic diseases; or other thrombotic, embolic, or hemorrhagic disorders. The study protocol complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Committees on the Ethics of Human Research of Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, RIKEN, and participating hospitals. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.  

# 2.2. Genome-wide association study  

A GWAS for ischemic stroke was performed in subject panel A with the use of the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set, consisting of  Sty I and  Nsp I chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and including    ${\sim}520{,}000$   SNPs distributed t hout the entire genome. Genotyping data with a call rate of <93% were discarded. The mean call rate for the remaining data in the present study was  $98.0\%$  . We examined the relation of allele frequencies of each SNP to ischemic stroke by the chi-square test and selected 894 SNPs with  $P$   values of  ${<}1.0\times10^{-20}$  . Searching of the NCBI dbSNP database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp ) resulted in the selection of 499 SNPs with a gene annotation. We next examined the relation of haplotypes of each haploblock to ischemic stroke and selected 455 ha plo blocks with  $P$   values of   ${<}1\times10^{-20}$  . Searching of the dbSNP database yielded 238 ha plo blocks with a gene annotation. We then selected 194 SNPs that were included in these ha plo blocks. We conﬁrmed that the genotype distributions of these SNPs in control subjects were all in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Finally, we discarded 94 SNPs for which the distribution of hybridization signals on the SNP chips deviated sign i cant ly   $\scriptstyle\left(P<0.001\right)$  ) from a normal distribution, and we examined the remaining 100 SNPs in the replication studies.  

# 2.3. Genotyping of SNPs  

Venous blood (7 mL) was collected into tubes containing  $50\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L}$   EDTA (disodium salt), the peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated, and genomic DNA was extracted from these cells with a DNA extraction kit (Genomix; Talent, Trieste, Italy). Genotypes of SNPs were determined at G&G Science (Fukushima, Japan) by a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-speciﬁc oli go nucleotide probes with suspension array technology (Luminex, Austin, TX). Primers, probes, and other conditions for genotyping of SNPs are shown in  Supplementary Table 1 . Detailed genotyping methodology was described previously  [8] .  

To evaluate the reproducibility of genotyping by suspension array technology in the present study, we selected DNA samples from 23 subjects and genotyped 95 polymorphisms by chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionization time of ﬂight (MALDITOF) mass spectrometry  [9] . Only four of the total of 2185 genotypes determined by this approach differed from those identiﬁed by suspension array technology. We then determined these four discrepant genotypes by DNA sequencing with a u or esc en ce-based automated DNA sequencer after amp li cation and cloning of polymorphic regions. All four genotypes determined by DNA sequencing were identical to those determined by suspension array technology, demonstrating the high reproducibility of the latter approach in the present study. Although we did not genotype samples in duplicate, the overall call rate for genotyping was   $99.2\%$  .  

# 2.4. Statistical analysis  

Quantitative data were compared between subjects with ischemic stroke and controls by the unpaired Student’s  t -test. Categorical data were compared by the chi-square test. Allele frequencies were estimated by the gene counting method,

Age and BMI values are means  $\pm S D$  . \*  $P\!<\!0.0001$   versus corresponding controls. †  $P\!=\!0.0032$   versus corresponding controls. ‡  $P\!=\!0.0016$   versus corresponding controls. §  $\scriptstyle P=0.0059$   versus corresponding controls. ||  $\scriptstyle P=0.0383$   versus corresponding controls.  

and the chi-square test was used to identify departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Allele frequencies of SNPs were compared between subjects with ischemic stroke and controls by the chi-square test. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed with ischemic stroke as a dependent variable and independent variables including age, sex   $.0\,=$   woman,  $1\,{=}\,\mathrm{mean}$  ), body mass index (BMI), smoking status (  $0\,{=}$   nonsmoker,  $1=$   smoker), the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia   ${\bf{\nabla}}0\!=\!{\bf{n o}}$   history of these conditions,  $1=$   positive history), and genotype of each SNP. Each genotype was assessed according to dominant   $.0\,=$   wild-type homozygote,  $1=$   heterozygote  $=$  variant homozygote) and recessive (  $.0\,=$   wild-type homozygote  $=$   heterozygote,   $1=$   variant homozygote) genetic mod- els, and the  $P$   value, odds ratio, and   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval were calculated. The similar analysis was performed with ischemic stroke as a dependent variable and independent variables including covariates except genotypes. We also performed a stepwise forward selection procedure to examine the effects of genotypes as well as other covariates on ischemic stroke. The  $P$   levels for inclusion in and exclusion from the model were 0.25 and 0.1, respectively. In the stepwise forward selection procedure, each genotype was examined according to a dominant or recessive model on the basis of statistical sign i can ce in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Unless indicated otherwise, a  $P$   value of  ${<}0.05$  was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical tests were performed with JMP Genomics version 3.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SNPAlyze version 6 software (Dynacom, Yokohama, Japan).  

# 3. Results  

The characteristics of the 6341 subjects enrolled in the study are shown in  Table 1 . In subject panel A, the frequency of men and the prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were greater, whereas age was younger, in subjects with ischemic stroke than in controls. In subject panel B, age, the frequency of men, and the prevalence of smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were greater, whereas BMI was smaller, in subjects with ischemic stroke than in controls. In subject panel C, the prevalence of hypertension was greater in subjects with ischemic stroke than in controls. Relations of conventional risk factors to ischemic stroke were examined in subject panels A, B, and C separately by multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Obesity was deﬁned as a BMI of  ${\geq}25\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$    on the basis of the criteria for Japanese and other Asian populations  [10] . In subject panel A, hypertension was a risk factor for, whereas age was protective against ischemic stroke because healthy elderly individuals were selected as controls. In subject panel B, age, male, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for, whereas obesity was protective against ischemic stroke. In subject panel C, age was a risk factor for this condition.  

We examined the relation of 100 SNPs selected from the GWAS with SNP chips in subject panel A to ischemic stroke in 4131 individuals (705 subjects with ischemic stroke and 3426 controls) selected from subject panel B by the chi-square test ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Three SNPs — rs1671021 of  LLGL2  (  $\scriptstyle P=0.0196$   and 0.0052 for geno

type distribution and allele frequency, respectively), rs9615362 of  CELSR1  (  $\cdot P\!=\!0.0058$   and 0.0060, respectively), and rs753307 of RUVBL2  (  $\scriptstyle{P=0.0277}$   and 0.0239, respectively) — were sign i cant ly  $\left(P\!<\!0.05\right)$   associated with ischemic stroke in terms of both genotype distribution and allele frequency in this population. We then sequenced exons and exon–intron boundaries of linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks [standardized linkage d is equilibrium coefﬁcient  $(r^{2})\!\ge\!0.3]$   including these SNPs ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) in 96 DNA samples from subjects with ischemic stroke. Data for LD blocks were obtained from the International HapMap Project database ( http://www.hapmap.org/index.html.ja ).  

The SNP rs1671021   $\mathsf{T}\to\mathsf{C}$  , Phe479Leu) is located in exon 12 of LLGL2 . Given that there were no data for LD blocks containing this SNP ( Supplementary Figure 1A ), we sequenced exon 12 of  LLGL2 and its intron boundaries. Although there was no SNP other than rs1671021 in exon 12, rs2305526   $({\mathsf{A}}\to{\mathsf{T}})$   and a   $C\!\to\!\mathrm{T}$   polymorphism (not detected in dbSNP) were observed in intron 13. These three SNPs were in LD ( Supplementary Table 4 ). The haplotype frequencies for these SNPs are shown in  Supplementary Table 5 . Both rs1671021   ${\mathrm{T}}\!\rightarrow\!{\mathsf{C}},$  , Phe479Leu) in exon 12 and rs2305526   $(\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{T})$  ) in intron 13 were tag SNPs.  

The SNP rs9615362   $(\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{C})$   is located in intron 10 of  CELSR1 . Given that an LD block containing this SNP includes exons 10–20 ( Supplementary Figure 1B ), we sequenced these exons and the corresponding exon–intron boundaries of  CELSR1 . In addition to rs9615362, we detected rs4044210   $\mathbf{\tilde{A}}\mathbf{\rightarrowG}$  , Ile2107Val) in exon 17, rs6007897 (  $\mathbf{\dot{A}}\to\mathbf{G}$  , Thr2268Ala) in exon 20, and rs6008788

  $(\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G})$   in intron 19 of  CELSR1 . These four SNPs were in LD

 ( Supplementary Table 6 ). The haplotype frequencies for these SNPs are shown in  Supplementary Table 7 . Both rs6007897   $\mathbf{\dot{A}}\to\mathbf{G}$  , Thr2268Ala) in exon 20 and rs6008788   $(\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}.$  ) in intron 19 were tag SNPs.  

The SNP rs753307   $\mathrm{\DeltaC\!\to\!T},$  ) is located in intron 13 of  RUVBL2 . Given that an LD block containing this SNP includes exons 7–15 of  RUVBL2 and exon 3 of  LHB  ( Supplementary Figure 1C ), we sequenced these exons and the corresponding exon–intron boundaries. In addition to rs753307, we detected rs1062708 (  $\mathrm{C}\!\rightarrow\!\mathrm{T},$   Leu205Leu) in exon 8 and rs2287760 (  $(\mathsf{C}\to\mathsf{G})$  ) in intron 8 of  RUVBL2 . These three SNPs were in LD ( Supplementary Table 8 ). The haplotype frequencies for these SNPs are shown in  Supplementary Table 9 . Both rs1062708 (  $\textstyle{\mathsf{C}}\to{\mathsf{T}},$  Leu205Leu) in exon 8 and rs2287760 (  $\mathsf{C}\to\mathsf{G}.$  ) in intron 8 were tag SNPs.

Haplotypes consist of the  $\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$   (rs6007897) and  $\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$   (rs4044210) polymorphisms of  CELSR1  

We next examined the relation of three tag SNPs in exons — rs1671021   $\mathrm{T}\!\rightarrow\!\mathsf{C}$  , Phe479Leu) of  LLGL2 , rs6007897   $\mathrm{'A}\!\rightarrow\!\mathrm{G}$  , Thr2268Ala) of  CELSR1 , and rs1062708   $\cdot\!\!\mathrm{C}\!\rightarrow\!\mathrm{T},$  , Leu205Leu) of RUVBL2  — as well as a non synonymous SNP [rs4044210   $(\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$  , Ile2107Val) of  CELSR1 ] to ischemic stroke in subject panels B and C. The chi-square test revealed that rs6007897 (  $\cdot\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$  , Thr2268Ala) and rs4044210   $\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$  , Ile2107Val) of  CELSR1  and rs1671021 (  ${\mathrm{~T\!\to\!~C}},$  , Phe479Leu) of  LLGL2  were sign i cant ly   $\left(P\!<\!0.05\right)$   associated with ischemic stroke in terms of both genotype distribution and allele frequency in subject panel B ( Table 2 ). The chi-square test revealed that rs6007897 and rs4044210 of  CELSR1  were also sign i cant ly  $(P\!<\!0.05)$   associated with ischemic stroke in terms of both genotype distribution and allele frequency in subject panel C ( Table 3 ).  

The relation of the three tag and one non synonymous SNPs to ischemic stroke was also examined in all subjects (combined subject panels A, B, and C). Evaluation of genotype distributions and allele frequencies by the chi-square test revealed that the four polymorphisms were all sign i cant ly   $'P\!<\!0.05)$   associated with ischemic stroke ( Table 4 ). Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia also revealed that rs6007897 and rs4044210 of  CELSR1  and rs1671021 of LLGL2  (dominant models) as well as rs1062708 of  RUVBL2  (recessive model) were sign i cant ly   $\scriptstyle{P<0.05)}$   associated with ischemic stroke ( Table 4 ). The variant    $G$   (Ala) allele of rs6007897 and  $G({\mathsf{V a l}})$   allele of rs4044210 of  CELSR1  were risk factors for ischemic stroke, whereas the variant  C  (Leu) allele of rs1671021 of  LLGL2  and the  T  allele of rs1062708 of  RUVBL2  were protective against this condition. The genotype distributions of these four SNPs were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium among both subjects with ischemic stroke and controls ( Table 4 ).  

We performed a stepwise forward selection procedure to examine the effects of genotypes for the four polymorphisms of  CELSR1 , LLGL2 , and  RUVBL2  as well as of age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyper c holesterolemia on ischemic stroke ( Supplementary Table 10 ). Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, BMI, smoking, sex,  LLGL2  genotype (dominant model),  CELSR1  genotype (rs6007897, dominant model), age, and  RUVBL2  genotype (recessive model), in descending order of statistical sign i can ce, were signiﬁcant   $(P\!<\!0.05)$   and independent determinants of ischemic stroke.  

Given that rs6007897 and rs4044210 of  CELSR1  were in LD, we performed haplotype analysis for these SNPs. Such analysis revealed that the frequency of the major haplotype, A (rs6007897)–A (rs4044210), was sign i cant ly lower, whereas that of the minor haplotype G–G was sign i cant ly higher, in subjects with ischemic stroke than in controls ( Table 5 ).  

Finally, we examined the relations of the three tag and one non synonymous polymorphisms to the prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or obesity ( Supplementary Table 11 ). Comparison of genotype distributions or allele frequencies of the four polymorphisms between all cases and controls by the chi-square test revealed that rs6007897 and rs4044210 of  CELSR1  as well as rs1062708 of  RUVBL2  were sign i cant ly   $\left(P\!<\!0.05\right)$   associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and smoking status revealed that rs6007897 and rs4044210 of  CELSR1  were sign i cant ly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus with the  G  allele of both polymorphisms representing risk factors for this condition. The rs1062708 of  RUVBL2 was also associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus with the  T  allele protecting against this condition ( Supplementary Table 12 ). The rs6007897 and rs4044210 of  CELSR1  were sign i cant ly associated with blood gly cosy late d hemoglobin content but not with fasting plasma glucose level. The rs1062708 of  RUVBL2  was not related to either parameter ( Supplementary Table 13 ).  

# 4. Discussion  

The main cause of ischemic stroke is at hero thrombosis, with the principal and treatable risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia  [11] . In addition to these conventional risk factors, genetic variants are important in the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke  [12] . Prediction of the risk for ischemic stroke on the basis of genetic variants would be useful for deciding how aggressively to target the clinical risk factors that are currently amenable to treatment. We have now shown that rs6007897 (  $\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$  , Thr2268Ala) and rs4044210 (  $\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$  , Ile2107Val) of  CELSR1  were sign i cant ly associated with the prevalence of ischemic stroke in Japanese individuals, with the variant    $G$   (Ala) and  G  (Val) alleles, respectively, representing risk factors for this condition.  

Kubo et al.  [13,14]  performed a genome-wide association study of ischemic stroke and identiﬁed two genes associated with this condition in Japanese individuals. The   $1425\mathsf{G}\to\mathsf{A}$   (Val374Ile, rs2230500) polymorphism of the protein kinase C, eta gene ( PRKCH ) was sign i cant ly associated with lacunar infarction in two independent populations. This polymorphism altered the activity of PRKCH. PRKCH was mainly expressed in vascular endo the li al cells and foamy macrophages in human at hero sclerotic lesions and its expression was enhanced as the lesion progressed  [13] . Four SNPs around the angiotensin II receptor-like 1 gene ( AGTRL1 ) were also associated with ischemic stroke. The    $-154\mathsf{G}\to\mathsf{A}$   polymorphism (rs9943582) in the promoter region enhanced the mRNA expression of  AGTRL1  [14] . A population-based cohort study with 14 years of follow-up revealed that functional SNPs of these genes were signiﬁcantly related to the incidence of ischemic stroke  [13,14] . The genes identiﬁed by GWAS differed between the previous  [13,14]  and our studies. Although the reason for the difference remains unclear, cases in the previous studies included subjects with all types of ischemic stroke  [13,14] , whereas those in our study comprised subjects with a the roth rom bot ic cerebral infarction. Platforms for GWAS also differed between the previous  [13,14]  and our studies.  

Cadherin, epidermal growth factor (EGF) laminin A G-type repeats (LAG) seven-pass G-type receptor 1 (CELSR1) is a member of the ﬂamingo subfamily of cadherin proteins. The ﬂamingo subfamily consists of atypical cadherins that do not interact with catenins. The ﬂamingo cadherins are localized to the plasma membrane and possess nine cadherin domains, seven EGF-like repeats, and two LAG repeats in their ec to domains. They also contain seven trans membrane domains, a characteristic speciﬁc to this subfamily. These proteins are thought to function as receptors in contactmediated communication, with the cadherin domains acting as homophilic binding regions and the EGF-like domains contributing to cell adhesion and receptor–ligand interactions (Entrez Gene, NCBI)  [15–17] . In situ hybridization and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction analysis have revealed substantial levels of  Celsr1  expression in the neural tube, brain, lung epithelium, and nascent eyelid of mouse embryos at embryonic day 11.5. In adult mice,  Celsr1  expression was detected in the spinal cord, eye, and brain, predominantly in ependymal cells lining the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles  [15] .  Celsr1  is a developmentally regulated, neural-speciﬁc gene that plays a role in early embryo genesis (Entrez Gene, NCBI)  [15] . The rs4044210 (  $\mathsf{A}\to\mathsf{G}$  , Ile2107Val) SNP in exon 17 of  CELSR1  is located in the region of the gene encoding the hormone receptor domain. This extracellular domain contains four conserved cysteine residues that likely form disulﬁde bridges. Given that this domain is present in a variety of hormone receptors, it may function as a ligand binding domain (Entrez Gene, NCBI).  

A SNP (rs646776) at 1p13 near  CELSR2 , which is homologous to CELSR1 , was shown to be associated with the serum concentration of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol  [18]  and the prevalence of myocardial infarction  [19] . However, rs6007897 and rs4044210 of CELSR1  were not related to lipid proﬁles in the present study. Given that identiﬁed SNPs of  CELSR1  were related to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the relations of these SNPs to ischemic stroke might be attributable, at least in part, to the effect on diabetes mellitus. Human  CELSR1 ,  CELSR2 , and  CELSR3  are planar cell polarity signaling molecules implicated in the regulation of cellular polarity, convergent extension, and invasion. Activation of the planar cell polarity signaling pathway controls tissue polarity and cell movement through the activation of ras homolog gene family, member A (RHOA), mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8), and nemo-like kinase (NLK)  [20] . The rs6007897 and rs4044210 of CELSR1  might inﬂuence this signaling pathway, although the effects of these SNPs on protein structure or function remain to be determined. A relation of genetic variants of  CELSR1  to human disease has not previously been demonstrated.  

Our results suggest that the lethal giant larvae homolog 2 gene ( LLGL2 ) is also a candidate gene for ischemic stroke in Japanese individuals, although the association of rs1671021 (  ${\mathrm{T}}\!\rightarrow\!{\mathsf{C}},$  , Phe479Leu) with this condition was not replicated in subject panel C. This gene encodes a protein similar to the lethal (2) giant larvae protein of Drosophila , which plays a role in asymmetric cell division, the establishment of epithelial cell polarity, and cell migration  [21,22] . The ability of the  Drosophila  protein to localize cell fate determinants is regulated by atypical protein kinase C  [22] . The human LLGL2 protein interacts with protein complexes containing atypical protein kinase C and is cortically localized in mitotic cells  [22] . Alternative splicing of  LLGL2  transcripts generates multiple mRNA variants that encode different protein isoforms (Entrez Gene, NCBI)  [21,22] . The effect of rs1671021 on protein structure or function remains unclear. Variants of  LLGL2  have also not previously been associated with human disease.  

There are several limitations in the present study: (i) Given that the study population comprised only Japanese individuals, validation of our ﬁndings is required in other ethnic groups. (ii) When the difference to detect was set to 0.01 and alpha to 0.05, the statistical power was not enough in subject panel A (0.2) as compared with that in subject panel B (0.95) or C (0.70). (iii) The number of subjects with ischemic stroke was small in a replication study with community-dwelling individuals (subject panel C). (iv) Given that the minor allele frequencies of  CELSR1  were low (  $1.5\%$   in rs6007897,  $1.6\%$   in rs4044210) in the total population, the clinical implication of the present results was limited. (v) The functional relevance of the identiﬁed polymorphisms of  CELSR1  with ischemic stroke remains to be determined.  

In conclusion, although the functional relevance of the identiﬁed SNPs to protein structure or function was not determined, our present results suggest that  CELSR1  is a susceptibility gene for ischemic stroke in Japanese individuals. Determination of genotypes for the identiﬁed SNPs of this gene may prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for ischemic stroke in Japanese. Validation of our ﬁndings will require their replication with independent populations of various ethnic groups.
