Background: Amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are important candidates in the development of hypertension, which is a major risk factor for stroke. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene that encodes the ENac  $\pmb{\alpha}$  -subunit (  ENaC) have been identified. We evaluated those SNPs for a possible association with ischemic cerebro vascular events (ICEs). Methods and Results:  We genotyped 1399 patients with ICEs [median age, 70 years; interquartile range, 58–78 years; 745   $(53\%)$  ) men] and 1076 control individuals without vascular disease [47 (39–58) years; 557   $(52\%)$  ) men] for the SNPs Trp493Arg and Ala663Thr. The SNP frequencies at nucleotide 3977 (Trp493Arg) in the  ENaC gene were significantly different in patients and controls. Carriers of 493Arg had a 1.78-fold increased risk   $(95\%$   confidence interval, 1.02–3.12) for ICEs compared with Trp/Trp carriers. Interaction analysis revealed that the relative risk was even higher in women in the lowest age tertile [adjusted odds ratio, 3.26 (1.10– 9.72)].  

Conclusions:  Carriers of the 493Arg allele are at increased risk for ICEs compared with Trp/Trp carriers. The effect is independent of traditional vascular risk factors and is particularly evident in younger women.  

The Trp493Arg variant in   ENaC may represent an important candidate genetic susceptibility factor in the development of ICEs.

Stroke represents one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Twin and family studies, together with observations in animal models, have shown that familial predisposition, in addition to established risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and age, contributes to the risk of stroke (1) . Identification and characterization of gene variants that mediate this genetic predisposition may allow improved therapy and prevention  (2–5) . The role of individual mutations has been controversial. This is related in part to the fact that genetic influences in stroke are polygenic and that stroke comprises several different phenotypes. The effect of a genetic alteration may depend on a permissive background. The presence of a genetic variant could become phenotypic ally evident only in combination with modulating exogenous factors such as smoking, diet, or obesity, among others, and may increase the risk of disease.  

The results of epidemiologic and animal studies have indicated that genetic influences play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension  (6) , which is the major risk factor for stroke. Amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels  $(\mathrm{ENCaCs})^{5}$    are responsible for the rate-limiting step of sodium re absorption in the distal nephron and are therefore important candidates in the development of hypertension. We evaluated the association of 2 common singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  $\alpha$  -subunit of the ENaC (  ENaC;  SCNN1A ; OMIM 600228) with ischemic cerebro vascular events (ICEs).  

# Materials and Methods  

# patients and controls  

Between October 1998 and December 2001, a total of 3516 Caucasian patients were recruited for the Vienna Stroke Registry database  (7) . Of these patients, 1397 with ICEs from 8 hospitals in Vienna could be included in the study. At the time of this study, 731 of 3516 clinical questionnaires   $(20\%)$   had not been completed; 992   $(28\%)$   patients had not provided informed consent or blood or DNA samples; for 145   $(4\%)$  ) patients, the diagnosis of cerebrovascular event had not been confirmed; and for 251   $(7\%)$  ) individuals, the cerebro vascular event was not ischemic. Importantly, the included patients were not significantly different from patients who could not be included with respect to age and sex distributions and stroke severity. The control group comprised 1078 individuals without a personal and/or familial history of arterial diseases, all participants of an official healthcare program in the city of Vienna. All control individuals were of Caucasian origin, and all individuals gave written informed consent. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee.  

The detailed clinical questionnaire included documentation of each participant’s medical history, with special reference to vascular diseases, including family history, risk factors, and medications. Results of technical and laboratory investigations, information regarding clinical severity as measured by validated scales, and the outcome and etiology of the event were documented  (8) .  

# definitions  

Patients with ICEs had either transient ischemic attacks or ischemic strokes verified clinically by a neurologist. Intracerebral hemorrhage was excluded by neuro radiology in all patients. Arterial hypertension was defined as either a history of arterial hypertension or blood pressure values above   $160/95~\mathrm{mmHg}\ 1$   week after the event. Hypertension was also considered present in patients receiving anti hypertensive medication. Diabetes mellitus was assumed when fasting blood glucose concentrations were

  ${>}1500\,\mathrm{\mg/L}$   or if a history of diabetes was reported

 (including patients receiving diabetes medication). This glucose concentration was chosen because the acutephase reaction in stroke patients can be associated with increased blood glucose even in the absence of diabetes. Hyper lipid emi a was defined as fasting total serum cholesterol  ${>}2400\,\mathrm{mg/L}$   and was assumed to be present in all patients receiving lipid-lowering medications.  

# genotyping assays  

Two common SNPs in   ENaC, Trp493Arg  (9)  and Ala663Thr  (10) , were tested as described previously. Briefly, DNA was extracted with the Puregene ®   DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra System Inc.). Genotyping was performed by PCR amplification followed by allele-specific hybridization essentially as reported previously  (11) .  

statistical analysis  

Continuous data are reported as the median and interquartile range (25th–75th percentiles). Discrete data are reported as counts and frequencies.  $\chi^{2}$    tests or, if appropriate, exact tests were used to compare groups of categorical data. Groups of continuous data were compared by the Mann–Whitney    $U$  -test or, as appropriate, the Kruskal–Wallis test.  

The SNPs were entered in a multivariate binary logistic regression model adjusting for potentially confounding effects of other baseline variables. These were selected for the final model if they had either a clinically/biologically plausible relationship with the outcome or were distributed unevenly between the genotypes, indicated by a  $P$  value  ${<}0.20$  . We used a hierarchical modeling strategy to test separately and jointly for an effect of demographic variables and cardiovascular risk factors. Primary interactions with demographic variables and vascular risk factors were assessed by multiplicative interaction terms and log likelihood-ratio  $\chi^{2}$    tests. The linearity of the logit assumption was checked for continuous predictor variables, and an analysis of residuals was performed. Regression analysis and overall model fit were performed according to standard procedures  (12) . The Cox–Snell  $R^{2}$  was used to assess the variability explained by each model. Stratified analyses were adjusted for the abovementioned baseline variables.  

A 2-sided    $P$   value    ${\leq}0.05$   was considered statistically significant. Calculations were performed with SPSS (Ver. 10.0; SPSS Inc.). Haplotype analyses were performed with a Bayesian method using PHASE (Ver. 2.0.2)  (13) .  

# Results  

analyses of demographic data  

The demographic data and baseline characteristics for patients and controls are given in Table 1. The patient population was significantly older and had a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors than controls. Consequently, we adjusted for these differences by multivariate logistic regression analysis.  

# analyses of genotyping  

In our cohort, the frequency of carriers of the rare 493Arg allele was significantly higher in patients   $[\mathsf{n}\,=\,80\,\,(6\%)]$  than in controls   $[\mathrm{n}~=~31$     $(3\%)$  ; Table 2], whereas the frequency of the Thr663Ala variant was similar in both groups. Because the screening model indicated increased odds for stroke in the presence of 1 Arg allele, all additional statistical analyses were performed assuming a dominant effect (Table 3). Baseline variables were evenly distributed between groups according to the Trp493Arg genotype (Table 4). The distributions of both variants were as expected for the Hardy–Weinberg proportions. Haplotype analyses did not reveal additional significant

information (data not shown), only that the double mutant 493Arg/663Thr allele was slightly more frequent in patients  $(2.4\%)$   than in controls   $(1.4\%$  ;  $P=0.03)$  ), which is consistent with the significantly higher frequency of the 493Arg allele in cases. All other haplotypes were equally distributed among both groups.  

association of  Trp493Arg  variant and ice After adjustment for age (in tertiles), sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyper lipid emi a, smoking, and body mass index, 493Arg carriers had a 1.78-fold increased risk for ICE  $[95\%$   confidence interval   $(95\%$   CI), 1.02–3.12;  $P\,=$  0.04] compared with 493Trp/Trp carriers by multivariate analysis (Table 5).  

The interactions between the Trp493Arg variant, age, sex, and the risk of stroke were significant. Carriers of the 493Arg allele in the lowest age tertile   $\langle{<}52$   years) had a markedly increased risk [odds ratio  $(\mathrm{OR})=2.88$  ;  $95\%$   CI, 1.39–5.96;    $P~=~0.004]$  , whereas for individuals in the middle (52–69 years) and upper   ${\scriptstyle\left<=69\right>}$   years) tertiles, we found no significant association between Trp493Arg and risk of stroke. Hypertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a, and smoking did not interact significantly with the 493Arg allele. Female carriers of 493Arg exhibited a

 2.06-fold increased risk for stroke   $(95\%$   CI, 1.14–3.73;  $P=$  0.016), whereas we observed no significant difference in males   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,1.52)$  ;  $95\%$   CI, 0.88–2.62;  $P\,=\,0.14$  ; data not shown). Considering age and sex together, male carriers of 493Arg in the lowest age tertile had a 2.66-fold increased risk for ICE   $(95\%$   CI, 1.0–7.06;  $P\;=\;0.05)$  ), and female carriers of 493Arg in the lowest age tertile had a

 3.26-fold increased risk for ICE   $(95\%~\mathrm{CI},~\bar{1}.10\Bar{-}9.72;~P~=$  0.034). In the middle and upper age tertiles, we found no

associations (for men,  $P=0.16$   and  $0.64;$   for women,  $P=$  0.13 and 0.43, respectively).  

# Discussion  

ENaCs are he ter omul time ric proteins formed by the association of 3 homologous subunits:  $\alpha,\;\beta,$   and  $\gamma.$  . ENaCs are responsible for the rate-limiting step of sodium reabsorption and therefore are important candidates in the development of hypertension  (14) . The  $\alpha$  -subunit appears to be the conducting unit because it alone can generate functional channels. Furthermore, this subunit has been found to be part of the amiloride-binding site. Previously, genetic variations have been identified in the gene coding for   ENaC. Some of these variants have been associated with essential hypertension and with the development of ICE  (13 ,  14) .  

The frequent Thr663Ala variant is situated in the COOH terminus of the protein, which shows considerable inter species variability  (15) . These inter species differences in the  $20\ \mathrm{C}$  -terminal amino acid residues also seem to explain species differences for regulatory proteins such as cystic fibrosis trans membrane conductance regulator. In contrast to the 663Thr allele,   ENaC activity was considerably lower in the presence of the 663Ala allele in a

Xenopus  oocyte model. At present, little is known about the Trp493Arg substitution, which is located at the Cterminal portion of the extracellular loop  (9) . Possibly, substitution of the polar Arg by the nonpolar Trp could also has functional effects on ENaC activity, but detailed studies of this variant have not been published.  

In our study on 2475 Caucasian individuals, we found that the Trp493Arg variant was associated with ICE. Interestingly, the Thr663Ala genotype, which has been reported to represent a risk factor for stroke in a Chinese population  (16) , was equally frequent among patients and controls of Caucasian origin. The association of Trp493Arg with stroke was independent of the presence of hypertension and other established vascular risk factors, but the effect of this polymorphism depended on age and sex. Stratification for age revealed a significant risk of ICE in the lowest age tertile. Considering age and sex together, young female  $493\mathrm{Arg}$   carriers   $\langle{<}52$   years) had a greater than 3-fold increased risk of ICE, but young male 493Arg carriers had a greater than 2-fold increased risk of

stroke. One might speculate that the stronger effect of the Trp493Arg polymorphism in women is related to the mineral oc or tico id effects of estrogen, which are similar to the effects of aldo ster one, which is the most potent stimulus for sodium re absorption in the cortical collecting tubule and the distal colon  (17 ,  18) . Interactions between genotype and sex are not uncommon. Recently, it was shown that expression of the angiotensin o gen gene is modulated by female sex hormones  (19) . The decreasing effect of the Trp493Arg polymorphism with age may be explained by a more pronounced role of other risk factors of ICE in older patients, e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyper lipid emi a.  

One limitation of this study is that the design of our study was of observational nature. We therefore can demonstrate only an association between the 493Arg allele and ICE; the causality of this genetic variant has to be determined in a prospective study. The controls were not population based, but the samples were collected during different times of the year within a 2-year period in 6 different health centers located in areas of Vienna with different socio demographic characteristics. Age and the presence of vascular risk factors were different in the patients and controls; therefore, all analyses were performed after appropriate statistical adjustments. We must also mention that although we tested for biologically plausible primary interactions, we cannot exclude secondary interactions.  

In conclusion, we present data suggesting that   $493\mathrm{Arg}$  represents a risk factor for ICE in Caucasians, especially in younger persons (  $\langle{<}52$   years). The effect of the Trp493Arg variant seems to be independent of other vascular risk factors, including hypertension. Further studies confirming these results seem indicated.
