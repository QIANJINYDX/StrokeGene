Introduction:  Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multi factorial and polygenic disease, which is affected by genetic factors. In this study, we  explored the role of  CYP19A1  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IS in the Chinese population.  

Methods:  1302 subjects (651 controls and 651 cases) were recruited in this case–control study. Four candidate SNPs (rs28757157  C/T, rs3751592 C/T, rs3751591 G/A, rs59429575 C/T) of  CYP19A1  were selected by the 1000 genomes project database. The  association between  CYP19A1  SNPs and IS risk was assessed using logistic regression analysis with odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$  confidence intervals (CIs). False-positive report probability (FPRP) analysis further verified the positive results. The interaction of  SNP-SNP was analyzed by multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) to predict is risk.  

Results:  In the research,  CYP19A1  loci (rs28757157 and rs3751591) were associated with the occurrence of IS. The two variants  conferred an increased susceptibility to IS in the subjects aged over 60 years old, smokers and drinkers. Rs28757157 was related to the  risk of IS in females, non-smokers and subjects with BMI less than 24, while rs59429575 was related to the risk of IS in males and  subjects with BMI greater than 24.  

Conclusion:  The study revealed that there is a significant association between  CYP19A1  loci (rs28757157 and rs3751591) and IS risk  in the Chinese Han population, providing a theoretical basis for further exploring its specific role in the pathogen es is of IS.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a multi factorial and polygenic disease, which is known to be the main cause of death and adult disability. In  general, most stroke patients cannot fully recover in the later stage. In severe cases, hemiplegia, lack of living ability, and  inability to take care of themselves will occur, which brings great mental and economic burdens to their families. Stroke  is divided into ischemic and hemorrhagic, of which   $85\%$   of stroke patients are due to ischemic. Moreover, hemorrhagic  stroke may occur in ischemic brain, but it is not clear how much bleeding begins from ischemic stroke (IS). In China,  stroke has become the leading cause of death. Up to 2013, stroke was the leading cause of death in 27 out of 33  provinces in China. The incidence of stroke in China is increasing year by year, but its pathogen es is is complex and has  not yet been elucidated. Through recent years of research, factors such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, 10  hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and alcohol consumption were found to be likely to influence IS burden in China.  However, numerous scientific studies have shown that IS was highly influenced by gene polymorphisms. Therefore, loci  should also be paid attention to in the study of the pathogen es is of IS.  

Cytochrome P450s are important oxidative metabolic enzymes that play a well-established role in the metabolism of  endogenous compounds and the metabolic clearance of drugs and other exogenous substances. Cytochrome P450s  enzymes can catalyze the metabolism of arachidonic acid into epoxy ei cos at rien oic acids, di hydroxy ei cosa tetra en oic  acids, and hydroxy ei cosa hex a en oic acids (HETEs). Advances in many disciplines have clarified the emerging role of  cytochrome P450 enzymes and their metabolic substrates and end-products in the pathogen es is of central nervous system  diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke. Now, studies have shown that CYP candidate  , genes and variant loci played a non-negligible role in the pathogen es is of IS. Cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily  A member 1 (CYP19A1), one of the members of cytochrome P450 genes, which encodes an aromatase enzyme that can  catalyze the conversion of C19 androgen, andros ten edi one, and testosterone to C18 estrogen, estrone, and estradiol,  respectively. In an article reported by Zheng et al, CYP19A1  variants were associated with Alzheimer's disease, but the  mechanism of  CYP19A1  loci in IS remains unclear.  

In this research, we used to explore the association between  CYP19A1  variants and the incidence of IS in the Chinese  population by logistic-regression analysis with OR and   $95\%$  , to provide the theoretical basis for the role of  CYP19A1  in  ischemic stroke.  

# Methods  

# Study Subjects  

In the present study, we used   $\mathrm{G}^{*}$  power 3.1.9.7 software to estimate the sample size of the case group and the control  group through an independent-sample   $t\cdot$  -test. The parameters were set as follows: Tail  $=2$  , Effect size  $=0.20$  ,  $\upalpha=0.05$  ,  Power  $=0.95$  , Allocation ratio  $\mathrm{N}2/\mathrm{N}1{=}1$  . Finally, 1302 subjects (651 controls and 651 cases) were recruited from Haikou  People’s Hospital. All participants were Han Chinese and signed informed consent. The study was approved by the ethics  committee of Haikou People’s Hospital.  

Based on the World Health Organization’s diagnostic criteria, all patients with IS underwent a series of diagnostic  tests, including standardized blood tests, as well as computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI). And each patient’s diagnosis was confirmed by at least two independent neurologists. Patients with a history of  transient ischemic attack, systemic inflammatory disease, or tumor were excluded from this study. In the controls, they  were examined at the physical examination center of the hospital at the same time. They had no history of hypertension,  diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebro vascular disease, etc.  

# SNPs Selection and Genotyping  

Based on the 1000-genome project ( https://www.international genome.org/ ) in the global population with minor allele  frequencies (MAFs)  ${\tt>}0.05$   and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)  ${\tt>}0.01$  , we selected variants of  CYP19A1  gene. In  addition, we applied online software-Agena MassARRAY Assay Designer 3.1 to design amplification primers and  extension primers ( Supplementary Table 1 ). By removing non-specific primers and ineffective primers, we finally  selected four loci (rs28757157, rs3751592, rs3751591 and rs59429575) on  CYP19A1  gene. Using our previously  extracted genomic DNA as a template, we completed SNPs genotyping for   $C Y P I9A I$    gene on the basis of the Agena  MassARRAY nucleic acid mass spectrometry platform. Data sorting and analysis of the genotyping results were finished  by Agena software Bioscience TYPER, version 4.0.  

# Statistical Analyses  

With the support of SPSS 19.0 and Microsoft Excel 22.0, we completed the data analysis. Among them, each SNP in the  control group was detected using the chi-square test to compare the expected and actual genotype frequencies of the  SNPs to test whether these loci were consistent with HWE. Subsequently, the allele and genotype frequencies of the  selected SNPs were analyzed in the case group and the control group using the chi-square test. The association between  CYP19A1  polymorphisms and IS risk was assessed by logistic regression analysis with odds ratios (OR) and   $95\%$  confidence intervals (CIs). FPRP tested for significant positive results at the power level   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,1.5)$  ) and a prior  probability level “0.25, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001”. Moreover, MDR software predicted the correlation between  CYP19A1  polymorphisms and IS risk from the perspective of SNP interaction (synergy or antagonism).   $\textsl{p}<\,0.05$    indicated statistical significance.  

# Results  

# The Information of Study Subjects and Variants  

Totally, 651 controls (437 males/214 females) and 651 cases (434 males/217 females) were randomly recruited in the study.  In the  Supplementary Table 2 , the basic information of subjects’ characteristics was shown in the table. The average age of  the controls and cases was   $60.55\pm0.23$   years old and   $63.76\pm0.39$   years old, respectively. Although the groups were not  matched in age   $(p=0.000)$  ), they were matched in gender   $(p=0.860)$  ). In addition, the average height, weight and BMI of  the controls (  $168.51\pm0.29$  ,   $65.43\pm0.43$   and   $23.01\pm0.13)$  ) and cases (  $168.56\pm0.28$  ,   $65.65\pm0.38$   and   $23.09\pm0.12)$  ) were  displayed in the table, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in height, weight, BMI index, smoking status  and drinking status between the two groups   $(p=0.910$  ,  $p=0.700$  ,  $p=0.633$  ,  $p=0.121$   and  $p=0.579)$  ).

# The Association Between  CYP19A1  Polymorphisms and Ischemic Stroke Risk (Overall  Analysis)  

In  Table 2  and  Figure 1 , we performed the correlation between  CYP19A1  polymorphisms and IS risk shown in the overall  analysis. In the allele model, rs 28757157 C and rs 59429575 C were associated with an increased risk of IS (OR: 1.23,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=$  0.030; OR: 1.27,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.020)$  ). A significant association of the rs28757157 was also observed in the heterozygous  $\mathrm{C/T}$   model  with OR: 1.42 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.004$  , the dominant model with OR: 1.39 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.005$   and the log-additive model with OR:  1.26 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.018$  . Meanwhile, rs28757157 and rs59429575 were providing risk for IS in the codominant (OR: 1.42 and   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.004$  ; OR: 1.47 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.003)$  ), dominant (OR: 1.39 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.005$  ; OR: 1.45 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.003)$  ) and log-additive  (OR: 1.26 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.018$  ; OR: 1.34 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.006)$  ) models. Subsequently, FPRP analysis was completed to verify the  significant above results in the allele model (rs28757157: Power  $=0.982$  , FPRP values  $=0.080$  , 0.206; rs59429575: Power  $=$  0.944, FPRP values  $=0.067$  , 0.178), the heterozygous model (rs28757157: Power  $=0.671$  , FPRP values  $=0.020$  , 0.058;  rs59429575: Power  $=0.564$  , FPRP values  $=0.011$  , 0.033) and the dominant model (Power  $=0.747$  , FPRP values  $=0.016$  ,  0.047; Power  $=0.610$  , FPRP values  $=0.011$  , 0.032) at the prior probabilities are 0.25 and 0.1 ( Supplementary Table 3 ).  

# Association Between  CYP19A1  Polymorphisms and Ischemic Stroke Risk Stratified by  Age and Gender  

In  Table 3 , we did the age and gender stratified analysis to assess the association between  CYP19A1  polymorphisms and  IS risk. In people older than 60 years old, the variant-rs28757157 showed a significant association with IS risk with OR:

locus provided an increased risk for IS in females (codominant: OR:   $1.70,p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.015$  ; dominant: OR: 1.62,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.020)$  ). In  males, a significant association between rs59429575 and IS risk were found in the allele (OR: 1.33,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\!=\!0.025)$  ), codominant (OR:  1.69  $,p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.001\$  ), dominant (OR: 1.64,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.001$  ) and log-additive (OR: 1.44,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.006)$  ) models.  

# Association Between  CYP19A1  Polymorphisms and Ischemic Stroke Risk Stratified by BMI  

In  Table 4 , BMI stratification analysis was also completed to evaluate the association between  CYP19A1  loci and IS risk.  In subjects with BMI greater than 24, variant-rs59429575 was found to be associated with IS risk in the allele (OR: 1.45,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.041$  ), codominant (OR: 1.87,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.008)$  ), dominant (OR: 1.84,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.007)$  ) and log-additive (OR: 1.59,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=$  0.014) models. In subjects with BMI less than 24, the locus showed a significant association with IS risk in the allele  model with OR: 1.27 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.035$  , the codominant model with OR: 1.45 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.012$  , the dominant model with  OR: 1.41 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.015$  , the log-additive model with OR: 1.29 and  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.037$  .  

# Association Between  CYP19A1  Polymorphisms and Ischemic Stroke Risk Stratified by  Smoking and Drinking  

In  Table 5 , smoking and drinking stratification analysis was also completed to evaluate the association between  CYP19A1  loci and IS risk. In the results of smoking stratification, variant rs28757157 was found to be significantly associated with

IS risk in smokers and non-smokers. Meanwhile, a significant association was observed between rs59429575 and IS risk  in the allele (OR: 1.48,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.011$  ), codominant (OR: 1.97,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.000)$  ), dominant (OR: 1.94,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.000)$   and log-additive (OR: 1.70,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.001$  ) models.  

In the results of drinking stratification, rs28757157 was related to the risk of IS (allele C: OR: 1.36,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.026$  ;  Heterozygous C/T: OR: 1.36,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.026$  ; dominant C/T-C/C: OR: 1.45,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.025$  ; log-additive: OR: 1.35,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=$    0.042) in drinkers. The variant-rs59429575 provided an increased risk for IS in the allele (OR: 1.48,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}\,=\,0.010$  ),  codominant (OR: 1.87,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.001\$  ), dominant (OR: 1.87,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.001$  ) and log-additive (OR: 1.65,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.002)$   models.  However, the two variants were not found to be associated with IS risk in drinkers and non-drinkers.  

# Association Between  CYP19A1  Polymorphisms and Ischemic Stroke Risk (Clinical  Information Analysis)  

In  Table 6 , we further performed comparative analyses of hypertensive patients versus non-hypertensive patients,  coronary heart disease patients versus non-coronary heart disease patients, and diabetic patients versus non-diabetic  patients in the case group. In the patients with and without diabetes, we found that rs28757157 was associated with an  increased risk of IS in the allele (OR: 0.66,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.025$  ), dominant (OR: 0.65,  $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.047)$  ) and log-additive (OR: 0.65,   $p_{\mathrm{adj}}=0.023)$  ) models. However, the loci did not show a significant association with IS risk in patients with hypertension  or coronary heart disease.  

# SNP-SNP Interaction Models of Candidate SNPs Analyzed by the MDR Software  

Then, MDR software was used to analyze the impact of potential SNP–SNP interaction on IS risk ( Supplementary  Table 4 ). The three-locus model containing  CYP19A1  loci (rs28757157, rs3751591 and rs59429575) was regarded as the

# Discussion  

In the research,  CYP19A1  loci (rs28757157 and rs3751591) were associated with the occurrence of IS. The two variants  conferred an increased susceptibility to IS in the subjects aged over 60 years old, smokers and drinkers. Rs28757157 was  related to the risk of IS in females, non-smokers and subjects with BMI less than 24, while rs59429575 was related to the  risk of IS in males and subjects with BMI greater than 24. The findings suggest that  CYP19A1  loci (rs28757157 and  rs3751591) may affect IS risk in individuals from China.  

Previous researchers have detected the expression of CYP450 aromatase in the human cerebral cortex, and even  found that it can regulate the metabolism of androgen and estrogen. For example, aromatase encoded by CYP19A1  played an important role in androgen metabolism. Gaella et al 18  found that Cyp19a1 was post-transcription ally   $\mathrm{{Cell}{f l}^{-/-}}$    up regulated in  testis, resulting in high aromatase activity. And excess aromatase partly caused defects in  spermatogenesis. In addition, aromatase encoded by CYP19A1 converts testosterone to estradiol. There is increasing  evidence that local estrogen synthesized by aromatase can also prevent cerebral ischemic injury. Among them, the  , aromatase encoded by CYP19A1 was thought to be beneficial to the injured brain. Compared with young male  rodents, young female rodents were less possibility to develop cerebral injury, because estrogen played a major role in  , neuro protection. Also,  CYP19A1  SNPs were also related to the occurrence of nervous system diseases, such as  Alzheimer’s disease 15  and astrocytoma. In addition, Zhang et al 23  observed the relationship between  CYP19A1  loci  (rs4646 and rs17601876) and a reduced risk of stroke. Although the above loci were not found to be associated with the  risk of stroke in our study, we first found that  CYP19A1  loci (rs28757157 and rs3751591) conferred an increased  susceptibility to IS.  

Previous studies have found that the prevalence of stroke gradually increases with age and that stroke patients are  more common in the elderly population. Gender is another key factor in the occurrence of stroke. According to the  subgroup analysis results of age, we observed that rs28757157 and rs59429575 showed an increased association with IS  risk in people older than 60 years old. However, the two loci were not found to be related to IS stroke in people younger  than 60 years old. Besides, our research showed that rs28757157 was related to the risk of IS in females, while  rs59429575 was related to the risk of IS in males. Therefore, our study suggested that the effect of  CYP19A1  polymorphisms (rs28757157 and rs59429575) on IS risk was age- and sex-dependent, but the underlying mechanism  remains unclear.  

Smoking is a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Previous studies have shown a strong dose-dependent relationship  between smoking and IS risk. As cigarette consumption increased, the incidence of stroke increased linearly. According  to the stratified analysis of smoking and alcohol consumption,  CYP19A1  loci (rs28757157 and rs3751591) were  associated with the occurrence of IS in smokers. Combined with the results of gender stratification, we found that  rs28757157 was related to the risk of is in females, while rs59429575 was related to the risk of is in males. We believed  that this may be closely related to participant’s living habits, such as smoking. With the change of people’s life concept,  drinking has become an indispensable way of communication in the process of interpersonal communication. Alcohol  consumption is also the risk factor for ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke risk increased with increasing frequency of  alcohol consumption. According to the stratified analysis of alcohol consumption,  CYP19A1  loci (rs28757157 and  rs3751591) were associated with the occurrence of IS in drinkers. The above correlation obtained was dependent on  drinking and smoking. Thus, this may be the reason why we strongly advocate people to actively quit smoking and  alcohol.  

In the present study, we observed that  CYP19A1  loci (rs28757157 and rs3751591) may be a risk factor for ischemic  stroke. However, this study has some shortcomings. First, the selected samples are mainly from one hospital, and the  sample size is not large. We further expand the sample size from different hospitals in the follow-up study to make the  obtained results credible. Second, the role of  CYP19A1  and its sites in ischemic stroke is unknown. Molecular  experiments need to be further explored to provide a theoretical basis for the mechanism of  CYP19A1  in ischemic stroke.
