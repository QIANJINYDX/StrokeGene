Abstract:  Objective: Ischemic stroke is a global health burden due to the increasingly higher incidence rate and  mortality rate. E tio logical research into the role of genetics in this heterogeneous disease may have diagnostic and  prognostic implications. The present study was designed to assess the association between  PTX1  SNPs: -717A>G  and   $\scriptstyle\cdot286\complement>\mathsf{T}>\mathsf{A}$  , and ischemic stroke risk. Methods: Risk of ischemic stroke was estimated using summary ORs.  The fixed effects model was performed in calculating the pooled ORs. All statistical data were analyzed with STATA  software. Results: We combined 4,604 subjects for SNP   $\cdot717\mathsf{A}{>}\mathsf{G}$   and 3,093 subjects for SNP -  $286\mathrm{C}{>}\mathsf{T}{>}\mathsf{A}.$  . SNP 

 -  $.717\mathsf{A}\!\!>\!\mathsf{G}$   was not found to be significantly associated with ischemic stroke risk (GG vs. AA,   $\mathsf{O R}=1.12$  ,   $95\%$     ${\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{I}}\;=\;$  0.83-1.50,  $\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{Het}}=0.207$  ;   $\mathsf{G G}+\mathsf{G A}$   vs. AA,  $\mathsf{O R}=1.04$  ,  $95\%$   ${\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{I}}=0.93$  -1.17,  $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{H e t}}=0.533$  ; GG vs.   $\mathsf{G A}+\mathsf{A A}$  ,  $0\mathsf{R}=1.10$  ,   $95\%$   $5\%\,{\sf C I}=0.82$  -1.47,  $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{H e t}}=0.220,$  ). Meta-analysis of SNP   $\scriptstyle286\complement>\mathsf{T}>\mathsf{A}$   also demonstrated no statistical evidence of a  significant association with ischemic stroke (AA vs. CC,  $0\mathsf{R}=0.86$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C l}=0.59–1.25$  ,  $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{H e t}}=0.348$  ; AA vs. CC,  ${\mathsf{O R}}={\mathsf{\Delta}}$  0.92,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}=0.80{\cdot}1.06$  ,  $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{H e t}}=0.609$  ; AA vs. CC,  $0\mathsf{R}=0.89$  ,   $95\%\,{\sf C l}=0.62–1.30$  ,  $\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{H e t}}=0.374,$  ). Conclusions: These  results suggest that the  PTX1  gene polymorphisms may not be associated with a predisposition to ischemic stroke.

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke constitutes approximately  $85\%$    of all strokes and has caused a large number of  deaths globally [1, 2]. Much effort has been  taken over the past decade to gain new insights  into the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke, with  massive numbers of genetic markers discov­ ered via family and twins studies [3, 4]. Since  then many epidemiologic and molecular stud­ ies have emerged to test the hypothesis that  variations between individuals may be associ­ ated with a predisposition to this heteroge­ neous disease.  

Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the forma­ tion and progression of ischemic stroke and  cardiovascular disease that represents an  important causative factor for ischemic stroke  [5-7]. The human  PTX1  gene with a spanning  size of 2,880 bps is mapped at chromosome 1  at q21-q23. The acute-phase protein belongs  to the pentraxin protein family and functions  through Fcgamma receptors to defend against  inflammatory responses and autoimmune dis­ eases [8], and the genes in the inflammatory  cytokine pathways in turn control the expres­ sion of  PTX1  [9]. There is mounting evidence of  serum  PTX1  levels as a predictor of ischemic  stroke [10-12]. The magnitude of  PTX1  expres­ sion is genetically determined, and almost half  of the alternation depends on host factors [13,  14]. As  PTX1  gene variations involves in the  regulation of the protein levels [15], investigat­ ing the association of the single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) and ischemic stroke  susceptibility may have diagnostic and prog­ nostic implications.  

The promoter SNPs in  PTX1  gene have been  proposed as possible biomarkers and can be  used to predict ischemic stroke [16]. The exist­ ing literature also suggests that the develop­ ment of ischemic stroke should not ascribe to  PTX1  SNPs [17-19]. In view of the inconsistent  reports, we undertook a meta-analysis to  assess the risk of ischemic stroke associated  with  PTX1 -717A>G and   $\scriptstyle\cdot286\complement>\mathsf{T}>\mathsf{A}$  .

the study contained complete  data that helped to calculate  an odds ratio and   $95\%$   confi­ dence intervals (OR and   $95\%$    CI); 4) genotype distribution in  controls was in Hardy-We-inberg equilibrium (HWE). Ac-cordingly, the following exclu­ sion criteria were also used:  1) not relevant to  PTX1  and  ischemic stroke, abstracts,  reviews; 2) genotype frequen­ cy not reported; 3) duplicate  publications, letters and re-view articles were excluded.  

Data abstraction  

To facilitate a general under­ standing of the eligible stud­ ies, in addition to allele and  genotype data, two investiga­ tors also extracted first au-thor’s surname, publication  year, samples’ ethnicity, ma-tching, control sources, DNA  source, number of cases and  controls,   $P$   value for HWE  wherever possible, and mea­ surement methods in dupli­ cate. Discussion among all  investigators was the solution  to disagreements.  

Statistical analysis  

Based on the genotype data in controls, we  tested HWE for all studies using the goodnessof-fit chi-square test. The association between  PTX1  SNPs and ischemic stroke risk was evalu­ ated using crude OR with   $95\%$   CI. Summary  ORs were calculated assuming homozygote,  dominant and recessive contrast models for  both SNPs.  

# Materials and methods  

# Identification of eligible studies  

We first used “ PTX1 ”, “C-reactive protein”,  “polymorphism”, “polymorphisms”, “genetic  variants”, and “ischemic stroke” to retrieved  the potentially relevant papers collected in the  PubMed  (website:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed). The latest search was undertak­ en on January 10, 2014. We then manually  searched the bibliographies of studies that  remained after excluding those obviously irrel­ evant to the genetic polymorphisms being  investigated and ischemic stroke. The studies  were included unless satisfying the following  criteria:  1) patients with ischemic stroke and  well-matched healthy controls were investigat­ ed; 2) they should be case-control studies; 3)  

Inconsistency across studies (heterogeneity)  was determined with the chi-square-based  Q-test and the I 2  metric [20].   $P_{\cdot}$  -values above  0.10 or I 2  more than  $50\%$   was representative of  significant heterogeneity, we therefore appro­ priately selected the fixed-effects model  (Mantel and Haenszel method) to calculate the  effects size; otherwise, the random-effects  model (Der Simoni an and Laird method) was  performed [21, 22].

Sensitivity analysis, Egger’s test and Begg’s  funnel plot were performed respectively to  examine the stability and reliability of the com­ bined effects in this meta-analysis [23-25]. All  statistical data were analyzed with STATA soft­ ware (version 12.0, STATA Corp., College  Station, TX). All two-tailed  $P$   values were consid­ ered significant at 0.10 unless specially  stated.  

# Results  

Selection of studies  

As detailed in  Figure 1 , a total of 461 records  matching the search terms were obtained from  the PubMed database. We referred to the  above-mentioned criteria and found three pub­ lications eligible for this analysis [16-19].  Another study was identified through manual  search, thus the total pooling dataset com­ bined data from four different studies, provid­ ing 4,604 subjects for   $-717\mathsf{A}\!\!>\!\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism  and 3,093 subjects for   $\scriptstyle-286C>\mathsf{T}>\mathsf{A}$   poly-morphism.  

Characteristics of studies  

For the studies finally considered in this metaanalysis, there was an equal distribution with  respect to ethnicity. However, they varied in  control source from Clinic to hospital, and in  genotyping measurements from TaqMan to  PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restric­ tion fragment length polymorphism). Incon-
 sistency with HWE was not seen in any control  group   $\mathsf{\tilde{P}}>0.10,$  ). More information can be cap­ tured in  Table 1 .  

Meta-analysis results  

As shown in  Table 1 , only one single study dem­ onstrated that the -717GG genotype was asso­ ciated with over 2-fold greater risk of ischemic  stroke compared to the -717AA genotype or the  AA and GA genotypes (GG vs. AA,   $\mathsf{O R}\,=\,2.09$  ,

The summary odds ratio (OR) is shown by the middle of a solid diamond whose left and right extremes represent  the corresponding   $95\%$   confidence interval   $.95\%$   CI). Horizontal axis represents ORs, which are calculated against  controls for each study.  

$95\%\,{\sf C I}=1.01.4.35$  ; GG vs.  $\mathsf{G A}+\mathsf{A A}$  ,  $0\mathsf{R}=2.09$  ,   $95\%\,{\sf C I}=\underline{{1.01.4.33}}$  ). Such a significant associ­ ation was lost when all studies were pooled into  a meta-analysis (GG vs. AA,   ${\mathsf{O R}}=1.12$  ,   $95\%$   CI 

  $=0.83–1.50$  ,  $P_{_{\mathrm{Het}}}=0.207$  ;   $\mathsf{G G}+\mathsf{G A}$   vs. AA,  ${\mathsf{O R}}={\mathsf{\Delta}}$  1.04,   $95\%\mathsf{C l}=0.93–1.17$  ,  $P_{_{\mathrm{Het}}}=0.533$  ; GG vs. 

  $\mathsf{G A}+\mathsf{A A}$  ,  $0\mathsf{R}=1.10$  ,   $\partial5\%\,\mathsf{C l}=0.82–1.47$  ,  $P_{_{\mathrm{Het}}}=$  0.220) ( Figure 3 ,  Table 1 ).  

In terms of the analysis of   $\scriptstyle-286C>\Gamma>\mathsf{A}$   polymor­ phism in total subjects, we did not observe any  statistical significance either in each single or  the combined dataset (AA vs. CC,   $\mathsf{O R}\,=\,0.86$  ,   $95\%\,{\sf C l}=0.59.1.2!$  5,  $P_{_{\mathrm{Het}}}=0.348$  ; AA vs. CC, OR   $=0.92$  ,   $\partial5\%~{\sf C I}\,=\,0.80\substack{-1.06}$  ,   $P_{_{\mathrm{Het}}}=0.609$  ; AA  vs. CC,   $\mathsf{O R}=0.89$  ,   $95\%$   $\begin{array}{r}{\d s_{0}\mathsf{C I}=0.62\!\cdot\!\!\underline{{1}}.}\end{array}$  30,  $P_{_{\mathrm{Het}}}=$  0.374) ( Figure 2 ,  Table 1 ).  

Sensitivity analysis  

We sequentially excluded the single studies  from the overall pooled analysis to check  whether the summary ORs were materially  changed. The recalculated ORs were found sta­ ble, indicating our results are valuable (data not  shown).  

# Publication bias  

Using Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s test, sta­ tistically significant publication bias was not  revealed in this meta-analysis, as funnel plots  showed a symmetrical distribution of the stud­ ies and Egger’s test exhibited no statistical evi­ dence of publication bias (  $\mathsf{P}=0.355$  ,  $\mathsf{t}=\mathbb{1}.\mathbb{19}$  for GG vs.  $\mathsf{G A}+\mathsf{A A}$  ;  $\mathsf{P}=0.932$  ,  $\mathsf{t}=-0.11$   for AA  vs. CC) ( Figures 4 ,  5 ).  

# Discussion  

In the current meta-analysis, consisting of  4,604 subjects for   $.717\mathsf{A}\!\!>\!\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism and  3,093 subjects for   $\scriptstyle-286C>\Gamma>\mathsf{A}$   polymorphism,  we clarified whether there exists an association  between the two  PTX1  genetic variants and  ischemic stroke risk. Overall, the   $.717\Delta{>}G$   was  found to not play a major role in the development  of ischemic stroke. We also found that both of

come under question due to  the inconsistency of the report­ ed associations between the  PTX1  polymorphisms and isch­ emic stroke susceptibility. The  majority of studies in recent  years have reported not finding  a role of these polymorphisms  in the disease [17-19], but repli­ cation of this finding has been  mixed [16]. The scantiness of  replicable associations plausi­ bly due to methodological limi­ tations including selection of  inappropriate controls, utility of  different platforms in genotype  determination, inadequate sa-mple size, and poor study  design.  

A number of prospective stud­ ies have reported a marked  impact of high  PTX1  levels on  risk of cardiovascular events  and all-cause mortality, even in  apparently healthy subjects  [32, 33]. The significant asso­ ciation between  PTX1  concen­ tration and ischemic stroke  susceptibility is further con­ firmed by a meta-analysis in  which individuals without a his­ tory of vascular disease are  analyzed [34]. Herein, we could  infer that a minor change in the  protein level of  PTX1 , which  has been shown to be affected  by  the  promoter  polymor­ phisms, may lead to a signifi­ cantly increased likelihood of  predisposing to ischemic stro-

ke. The failure to provide supportive evidence  of such a theoretically positive association in  our study is most likely because of the inade­ quate sample size. Therefore, explorations  should be continued to determine the role of  PTX1  gene and the genetic polymorphisms in  ischemic stroke.  

the C allele and the A allele of SNP -286C>T>A  were not associated with a significantly  increased risk of ischemic stroke in general  population.  

The identification of  PTX1  gene as a marker of  inflammation degrees leads to great interest in  the ischemic stroke genetic community [26]. An  increasing body of epidemiologic and molecu­ lar evidence over the past ten years has vali­ dated the  PTX1  as an ischemic stroke suscepti­ bility locus [27-31]. The involvement of the  PTX1  gene in ischemic stroke predisposition as  evidenced in previous reports, however, has  

During the malignant progression of ischemic  stroke, complex interactions between genetic  and environmental factors are reportedly to  play an important role. Individuals of different  ethnicities have different lifestyles, dietary pat­ terns, and residential environments; an unfa­ vorable combination of these factors may con­ stitute a decisive factor for ischemic stroke.  The incidence rate of this disease in Asians,  especially those from east Asian countries, is  obviously lower compared to the Caucasians  and blacks [35], suggesting Asian populations  may be less susceptible to ischemic stroke  than Caucasian and black populations.  

In this study, we are not allowed to identify  whether the  PTX1  gene polymorphisms predis­ pose to ischemic stroke in an ethnicity-depen­ dent manner or not, due to the inaccessibility of  raw data. This is the first limitation that future  studies should overcome. Second, genetic pre­ disposition may differ depending on the age,  gender, and other con founders, hence interplay  of genetic and environmental factors should be  considered on condition that original articles  report sufficient data. Third, as there may be  unpublished data beyond our reach, we cannot  assure inclusion of all studies that meet all  selection criteria in this analysis, although we  have put equal emphasis on publication during  literature search. However, meta-analysis has  stronger statistical power than any individual  study in detecting genetic associations, so the  results revealed in our analysis are trus-tworthy.  

In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrated  little evidence to support a role of  PTX1  gene  polymorphisms in ischemic stroke predisposi­ tion. Further larger studies are needed to con­ firm these findings and to validate the associa­ tion between  PTX1  gene polymorphisms and  ischemic stroke in various ethnic groups.
