Front. Med. 3:17.  doi: 10.3389/fmed.2016.00017 Plasma kallikrein formed from pre kalli k re in   $({\mathsf{P K}})$   produces bradykinin from kininogens  and activates factor XII. Plasma PK is activated by factors  α XIIa,  β XIIa, or prolylcarbox y pep tid as e (PRCP). A cross-sectional investigation determined if there is an association of  PRCP  and   $K L K B\mathcal{I}$   polymorphisms with cardiovascular disease (CVD). DNA  was obtained from 2243 individuals from the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin  Converting Enzyme trial. Two  PRCP  SNPs, rs7104980 and rs2298668, and two  $K L K B\mathcal{I}$    SNPs, rs3733402 and rs3087505, were genotyped. Logistic regression models were  performed for history of diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, ang io graphic  coronary disease, CABG, intermittent c lau dication, percutaneous trans lumina l coronary  angioplasty (PTCA), and transient ischemic attack. The  PRCP  SNP rs7104980 increased  the odds of having a history of PTCA by   $21\%$   [odds ratio   $(\mathsf{O R})=1.211$  ;   $95\%$   confidence  intervals   $\left(\mathsf{C}\right)\,=\,\left(1\,.008,\ 1\,.454\right)]$  ;   $P\,=\,0.041$  , but was non-significant after Bonferroni  correction. Alternatively, having the G allele for rs3733402   $(K L K B\mathcal{I}$   gene) decreased the  odds of having a history of ang io graphic coronary disease by   $24\%$     $[{\mathsf{O R}}=0.759$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C}|=(0.622,0.927)]$  ;  $P=0.007$   that was statistically significant   $(P<0.01)$  ) after Bonferroni  correction for multiple hypothesis testing. When the best-fit model based on the Akaike  information criterion controlled for age, weight, gender, hypertension, and history of  angina, the   $\textcircled{\scriptsize{1}}$   allele of  KLKB1  rs3733402 that is associated with less plasma kallikrein  activity correlated with reduced history of CVD.

# INTRODUCTION  

Plasma pre kalli k re in (PK) is a zymogen whose enzyme plasma kallikrein is known to initiate and  amplify factor XII activation on collagen and polyphosphates in plasma in the intra vascular compartment to activate intrinsic blood coagulation. Formed plasma kallikrein is also the major enzyme  to generate bradykinin from high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and to convert plasminogen  to plasmin and single-chain urokinase to two-chain urokinase  for fi bri no lysis, C3 and C5 to C3a and C5a, respectively, in the  complement system and prorenin to renin in the renin angiotensin system. There are several SNPs that have been recognized to  impact PK function.  KLKB1  rs3087505 is associated with venous  thrombosis and this SNP is in linkage d is equilibrium (LD)  with two  F11  SNPs (rs2036914, rs3756008) also associated with  thr ombo embolism ( 1 ,  2 ). Also an exon 5 N124S polymorphism  (rs3733402) in Apple domain 2 results in reduced PK complex  formation to HK, its plasma, and cell membrane-binding protein  ( 3 – 5 ), and this interferes with optimal PK activation and BK  formation. Recent studies with   $k l k b I^{-/-}$   mice indicate that animals lacking  klkb1  have delayed arterial thrombosis not due to  reduced contact activation but due to reduced vessel wall tissue  factor ( 6 ,  7 ). These combined studies suggest that PK contributes  to vascular homeostasis. Infact, previous work by our own group  demonstrated that elevated plasma PK correlates with accelerated  vascular disease and protein uri a in a large population of diabetic  patients ( 8 ,  9 ).  

P roly l carbo xy pep tid as e (PRCP) is a membrane-associated  serine protease that cleaves peptides where the penultimate  position is a Pro-X bond ( 10 ,  11 ). As an exo pep tid as e, it has  been recognized to degrade desArg9-bradykinin, angiotensin  II and III, and   $\upalpha$  -melanocyte-stimulating hormone  $_{1-13}$   ( 10 – 12 ).  We also have shown that it is a plasma PK activator when PK  assembles on HK on endo the li al and other cell membranes,  suggesting that it is an endo pep tid as e as well ( 13 – 15 ). Genetic  studies have identified an association between  PRCP  and essential hypertension and metabolic syndrome ( 16 ,  17 ). An exon  SNP of  PRCP  (rs2298668, E112D) indicates risk for chronic  hypertension and pre e clamps i a in an African-American  patient population ( 18 ). In a Han Chinese population, it is  associated with treatment resistance to an ACE inhibitor ( 19 ).  In another study of Han Chinese subjects, the G allele of intron  SNP rs7104980, but not rs2298668, is associated with essential  hypertension [odds ratio  $\mathrm{(OR)}\,{=}\,1.98$  ,  $95\%$   confidence intervals   $(\mathrm{CI})=1.62–2.43$  ,   $P=0.3\times10^{-10}]$   ( 20 ). PRCP-deficient gene- trap  $\left(p r c p^{g t/g t}\right)$   mice that have  $25\%$   PRCP normal protein levels in  their organs are constitutive ly hypertensive and have a heightened risk for arterial thrombosis ( 21 ). Likewise, spontaneous  hypertensive rats (SHR) compared to their control Wistar rats  also have reduced PRCP in cardiac tissue ( 22 ). PRCP deficiency  in mice is associated with increased vascular inflammation and  reduced cell proliferation, ang io genesis, and wound repair from  physical injury and ischemia reperfusion ( 23 ). Opposite to PK,  the presence of PRCP reduces vascular inflammation and arterial thrombosis.  

In the present investigation, we asked if polymorphisms  of PRCP and PK are associated with cardiovascular disease  (CVD). In a single cross-sectional study, we show that the G  allele for  PRCP  intronic rs7014980 associates with CVD but  does not meet statistical significance. Alternatively, the minor  G allele of an exonic SNP rs3733402 (N124S) of  KLKB1  is  significantly associated with reduced CVD. These data suggest  that a selected  KLKB1  SNP (rs3733402) mirrors the phenotype  observed in patient studies with diabetes and on murine deletions of  klkb1  ( 7 – 9 ).  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data Collection  

Plasma samples for our cross-sectional investigation below  were provided from the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin  Converting Enzyme (PEACE) Inhibition Trial that were in the  NIH Bio repository BioLincc (https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/ home/) ( 24 ). In the original PEACE trial, all participants signed  informed consent that was approved by their local IRBs for blood  collection ( 24 ). The goal of the PEACE trial was to test whether  ACE-inhibitor therapy would reduce the rate of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), death from cardiovascular causes, or  coronary re vascular iz ation in low-risk patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal or slightly reduced left ventricular  function (ejection fraction   ${\tt>}40\%$  ). The criteria for selection in  the PEACE trial were individuals   ${>}50$   years old with evidence  of coronary artery disease documented by one of the following  three criteria: (1) MI   ${>}3$   months from enrollment, (2) coronary  artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous trans lumina l  coronary angioplasty (PTCA)   ${>}3$  months from enrollment, and  (3) obstruction of at least one luminal diameter  ${>}50\%$   of at least  one native vessel on coronary angiography, and toleration of the  medication and   ${>}80\%$  compliance with the medication ( 24 ).  The cardiovascular phenotypes were defined in the PEACE trial  and obtained from its data dictionary ( 24 ). The outcomes of the  present analysis were compared with the baseline, pre treatment  cardiovascular phenotype of the subjects. We determined if the  present selected SNPs correlated with the mild cardiovascular  phenotypes of the subjects of the PEACE trial.  

The subsample of subject plasmas from the repository were  de-identified from the individual donors but were linked by code  to clinical information in the data dictionary ( 23 ). The samples  that were provided by NHLBI BioLincc were chosen by random  availability of   $1~\mathrm{{ml}}$   plasma aliquots for shipment. We obtained  an exempt approval from the University Hospitals Case Medical  Center IRB NHR-12-13. Two thousand two hundred forty-three  (  $\left.N=2243\right)$  ) plasma samples from the PEACE trial were used for  DNA isolation. DNA was extracted by the NucleoSpin Plasma XS  technique (Macherey-Nagel, Inc.) yielding   $0.03{-}0.1~\upmu\mathrm{g}/$  sample.  The extracted DNA had whole-genome amplification using  REPLI $\mathrm{g}$   Mini Kit (Cat# 150023) (QIAGEN) to yield   $10\;\mathrm{mg/ml}$  .  DNA samples were quantified using Qubit DNA quant if i cation  assay and a Qubit 2.0 Flu oro meter (Life Technologies).  

As described above, two SNPs from  PRCP  that have been  associated with hypertension, intronic rs7104980 (11:82864153)  ( 20 ) and exonic rs2298668 (11:82853252) (E112D) ( 18 ,  19 ) were  studied. Also, two SNPs from  KLKB1  that have been associated with vascular function were chosen for study; rs3087505  (Chromosome location, 4:186258332) ( 1 ,  2 ) from the   $3^{\prime}\mathrm{UT}$  and exonic rs3733402 (4:186236880) (N124S) ( 3 ). All SNPs  studied were listed as Illumina Golden Gate validated and ABI  TaqMan genotyping assays were available for them. ABI TaqMan  chemistry consists of two probes labeled with either VIC or  FAM and a primer pair to detect the specific SNP. Genotyping  these samples was performed according to the manufacturer’s  protocol. Specifically,  $3{-}5\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   aliquots, containing  $5{-}10\,\mathrm{ng}$   of DNA  were transferred from 96-well reservoir plates to 384-well assay  plates for each individual being genotyped. Multiple 384-well  assay plates were generated; the DNA was dried down, the plates  then sealed, and frozen until assayed. A   $5~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   aliquot of Master  Mix, Probe and Primer was robotic ally added to each well of a  384-well plate previously plated with DNA. PCR (40 cycles) was  carried out on an ABI GeneAmp PCR System 9700 Dual Head  Instrument and endpoint reads were carried out using the ABI  7900 Sequence Detection System (SDS). All assay mixtures were  prepared in an amplicon-free room to avoid contamination.  Data from each SNP were clustered using ABI’s SDS version 2.3  Software and Genotyping Calls (Vic/Vic; Fam/Fam; Vic/Fam)  were automatically made by the software. Each file was manually  inspected to remove outliers. The error rate of each SNP not  identifying the genotype of eight control DNA samples examined  15 times over the course of the study was   $6.9\%$   for rs7104980,   $6.2\%$   for rs3087505,  $13\%$   for rs2298668, and   $7.4\%$   for rs3733402.  These rates are similar to other large-scale genetic epidemiology  studies.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Genotyping rates were calculated for each SNP across all individuals. Allele and genotype frequencies were calculated for  each SNP. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and pairwise  LD were assessed using standard methods. A heatmap was  used to determine if SNP rs3733402 is in LD with  F11  SNPs  rs2036914 and rs3756008, respectively. Unconditional logistic  regression models assessed the association between candidate  SNPs and various disease outcomes calculating ORs and  $95\%$   CI.  For each candidate SNP, having the rarer allele was compared  to not having the rarer allele. Other covariates included in the  logistic regression models were age, weight, gender, hypertension status, history of diabetes, history of angina, and/or cigarette use. Hypertension in the PEACE trial was defined as having  systolic blood pressure greater or equal to   $140\ \mathrm{mmHg}$   and/or  having diastolic blood pressure greater or equal to   $90~\mathrm{mmHg}$    ( 24 ). This variable is user-defined specific for this investigation  and different from the history of hypertension variable used  in the PEACE trial. For cigarette use, the “rarely” and “never”  categories were combined and compared against “frequent”  cigarette use. Logistic regression models were then compared  using specific   $-2\log$   likelihood values in order to calculate the  Akaike information criterion (AIC) ( 25 ). The result with the  smallest AIC was chosen as the best-fitting model. Multiple  hypothesis testing was corrected by the Bonferroni correction  method. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 and R.  

# RESULTS  

# Frequencies  

Patient characteristics are presented in  Table  1 . Ninety-two  percent of the subjects in the control and treated groups of the  PEACE trial were Caucasians. The mean age of the 2243 successfully genotyped participants was   $64\pm8$   years, female   $(18\%)$  ,  frequently smoked cigarettes   $(14\%)$  , and had a history of transient  ischemic attack (TIA)  $(3\%)$  , stroke  $(4\%)$  , intermittent c lau dication   $(8\%)$  ,  diabetes   $(15\%)$  , and CABG   $(36\%)$  . The majority of patients  did have a history of angina   $(71\%)$   and ang io graphic coronary  disease   $(66\%)$  . These patient characteristics were similar to the  overall PEACE study population ( 24 ). This subset study that  represents 2243 out of the total 8290 patients in the overall  PEACE study population (  $(27\%$  of total) had similar clinical  characteristics as the PEACE trial with exception of the incidence  of hypertension (current trial 25 vs.   $45\%$   in PEACE), history of  PTCA (current trial 43 vs.   $72\%$   in PEACE), and history of MI  (current trial 42 vs.   $55\%$   in PEACE) ( 24 ).  

Allele and genotype frequencies are presented in  Table 2  for  the candidate SNPs in the  PRCP  and  KLKB1  genes. Across all four  SNPs, the frequency of undetermined genotypes ranged from 5.1  to   $8.4\%$  . For rs7104980 in the  $P R C P$  gene, the less common allele

For rs2298668 in the   $P R C P$   gene, the less common  allele was the G allele   $(8.3\%)$   and the rarer genotype was the G  homozygote (G/G)   $(5.8\%)$  . For rs3087505 in the  KLKB1  gene,  the less common allele was the A allele   $(10.29\%)$   and the rarer  genotype was the A homozygote (A/A)   $(3.3\%)$  . For rs3733402 in  the  KLKB1  gene, the less common allele was the G allele   $(48.1\%)$  )  and the rarer genotype was G/G   $(31.4\%)$  .  

# Assessment of Hardy–Weinberg  Equilibrium and Linkage D is equilibrium  

The Hardy–Weinberg chi-square values for each SNP (HWE), as  well as the LD correlation coefficients between each SNP per gene,  were computed. Low   $P$  -values associated with the chi-square  statistic for the HWE tests were observed that were the result of  a large sample size, suggesting that the SNPs were in violation of  HWE. This finding was due to having a statistical power large  enough to detect small differences in this study that were not  truly biologically meaningful. Hence, no SNPs were removed. In  addition, both the allele and genotype frequencies for all tested  SNPs were very similar to those from the dbSNP Hapmap CEU  frequencies ( Table 2 ). There were no SNPs in significant LD. The  correlation coefficient between the two  PRCP  SNPs was 0.372,  and the correlation coefficient between the two  KLKB1  SNPs was  0.277, which were both smaller than the cutoff value of 0.8 for  assessing significant LD. In a previous study examining SNPs  associated with venous thrombosis,  KLKB1  SNP rs3087505 was  found to be in LD with two  F11  SNPs rs2036914 and rs3756008  ( 1 ). We determined that  KLKB1  SNP rs3733402 is not in LD with  F11  SNPs rs2036914 and rs3756008, although the two F11 SNPs  are in LD with each other ( Figure 1 ).  

# Logistic Regression Models and Model  Selection  

Initially, logistic regression models were run for various CVDassociated outcomes, including history of diabetes, MI, stroke,  angina, ang io graphic coronary disease, CABG, intermittent  c lau dication, PTCA, and TIA. The “baseline” model controlled  for patient age, weight, and gender ( Table 3 ). No associations  were found for the  PRCP  rs2298668 and  KLKB1  rs3087505  SNPs. Having the rare G allele compared to not having the G  allele for rs7104980 (PRCP gene) increased the odds of having a history of PTCA by   $21\%$     $[\mathrm{OR}=1.211$  ;   $95\%\;\mathrm{CI}=(1.008$  ,  1.454);   $P\,=\,0.041$  ]. Alternatively, having the rarer G allele

compared to not having the G allele for rs3733402 ( KLKB1 gene) decreased the odds of having a history of ang io graphic  coronary disease by  $24\%$     $[\mathrm{OR}=0.759$  ;  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=(0.622,0.927)$  ;   $P=0.007]$  ]. After correcting for testing multiple SNPs by the  Bonferroni correction method, only SNP rs3733402 ( KLKB1 gene) was significantly associated with an outcome of having a  history of ang io graphic coronary disease (adjusted  $P<0.0125.$  )  ( Table 3 ).  

In order to better understand the potential association between  having the G alleles for rs7104980 and rs3733402 and CVD, we  calculated the   $^{-2}$   log-likelihood values in order to calculate  the AIC to determine the best-fitting model ( 25 ). As shown in  Table 4 , the final model chosen for rs7104980, which had the  lowest AIC, controlled for the baseline covariates (age, gender,  and weight), hypertension, and history of angina. Having the G  allele compared to not having the G allele for rs7014980 ( PRCP

Alternatively, having the G allele compared  to not having the G allele for rs3733402 ( KLKB1  gene) decreased  the odds of the baseline covariates, hypertension, and history of  angina by  $24\%$     $[\mathrm{OR}=0.762$  ;  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=(0.623,0.931);$  ;  $P=0.008]$  ],  which was statistically significant (  $(P\leq0.01)$   for multiple testing  after Bonferroni correction.  

# DISCUSSION  

The present cross-sectional study suggests that a polymorphism  in  KLKB1  associated with reduced PK binding to HK leading  to a less actable zymogen is associated with reduced CVD.  However, we are cautious in over interpreting the results of this  investigation because it has several limitations. The PEACE trial  was performed on low-risk individuals with CVD who had  stable coronary artery disease and normal or slightly reduced left  ventricular function. The patient population was   $82\%$   male with  the majority of patients between 51 and 70 years of age with only   $14\%$   frequent smokers. The majority of patients did not have TIA,  stroke, c lau dication, diabetes, hypertension, CABG, or PTCA.  The present subset analysis of samples from the PEACE trial was  similar in most ways, but actually had subjects with significantly  reduced incidence of hypertension, PTCA, and MI. Since these  three indicators are important disease markers of CVD, their  reduction may have influenced the outcomes of the present  studies. Overall, the present study examined a healthier subset  of individuals with lower risk CVD than in the original PEACE  trial itself.  

Although there were no associations with the non-coding  SNP associated with venous thrombosis, it is of interest that the  KLKB1  exonic SNP, rs3733402 (N124S), was shown to be protective in the studied subjects for having a history of ang io graphic  coronary artery disease ( Table 3 ). Rs3733402 is not in LD with  two  F11  SNPs associated with venous thrombosis even though  KLKB1  SNP rs3087505 from the   $3^{\prime}$  prime UT region is ( 1 ). The  meaning of SNPs of different genes being in LD and associated  with one disorder, such as venous thrombosis, is not known. The  N124S polymorphism is in the Apple domain 2 of PK where  HK binds ( 3 ,  26 ). Since the majority of plasma PK circulates in  complex with HK and HK is a PK receptor on endo the li al cells,  the polymorphism of rs3733402 may be functionally important  in vivo  ( 4 ,  5 ). Rs3733402, a common polymorphism, is associated  with reduced PK binding to HK ( 3 ). The polymorphism alters  a PK g lycos yl ation site that reduces its ability to bind to HK ( 3 ,  26 ). PK’s ability to bind to HK is important to protect plasma  kallikrein from inhibition by C1 inhibitor and for PK’s activation  by PRCP on cells ( 5 ,  27 ). This polymorphism may promote C1  inhibition of plasma kallikrein and reduce PRCP activation of  PK to plasma kallikrein, thus limiting plasma kallikrein activity  in two ways  in vivo  ( 27 ,  28 ).  

Previous studies by us have shown that elevated plasma PK  is associated with accelerated diabetic vascular disease ( 8 ,  9 ).  Elevations of plasma kallikrein may be associated with increased  prorenin conversion to renin and renin formation leading to  elevated angiotensin II. Recent genome-wide meta-analysis studies indicate that the  KLKB1  SNP rs3733402 has a positive correlation with circulating B-type na tr iure tic peptide, a recognized  car dio protective va so dil at or in African Americans ( 29 ). Other  recent studies show that PK deficient mice   $(k l k b l^{-/-}$   mice) have  reduced arterial thrombosis providing support in mouse models  to enhance the observation made in human association studies  ( 6 – 9 ). It is of interest that mechanism for delayed thrombosis in   $k l k b I^{-/-}$   mice is mediated in part through elevated prost a cyclin  and vasculo-protective transcription factors Sirt1 and KLF4 with  reduction of vessel wall tissue factor and not reduced contact  activation as is commonly believed ( 7 ). The results of the present  investigation showing that rs3733402 is associated with decreased  CVD are consistent with these other studies ( 8 ,  9 ). Combined  these investigations suggest that lowered PK may improve vascular health indirectly by reducing vessel thrombosis risk.  

In the present investigation, it might be construed that  significance of rs3733402 with a history of ang io graphic  coronary disease is not consistent with the results observed for  intermittent c lau dication, PTCA, and angina ( Table 3 ). The lack  of association with intermittent c lau dication is not surprising  because there was a very small group of individuals in the study  population with this clinical problem. In a similar manner, one  may argue that the population of study subjects with PTCA was  also a smaller group than the ang io graphic coronary disease  group. When a logistic regression study was performed with a  baseline model, including age, weight, gender, hypertension,  and history of angina, history of angina did contribute to the  best-fitting model ( 25 ) ( Table 4 ).  

The studies on  PRCP  SNPs were performed because PK is  a substrate of PRCP. Furthermore, investigations show that an  absence of PRCP in gene-trap mice is associated with CVD  manifested as vascular inflammation, including increased vessel leuk o cyto s is, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis with  reduced cellular proliferation, constitutive anti coagulation, and  vessel ang io genesis and repair after mechanical and ischemia/ reperfusion injury ( 21 ,  23 ). The current study suggests that the G  allele of rs7104980 of  $P R C P$  may be a cardiovascular risk factor  for PTCA, controlling for age, weight, and gender   $(P<0.041)$  ),  but the Bonferroni correction of the  $P$  -value for the total number  of SNPs (  $\left.P<0.0125\right)$  ) shows non-significance ( Table 3 ). Likewise  the use of the AIC to choose the best-fitting result did not identify  additional subsets such as hypertension or history of angina that  increased the significance of this association ( Table 4 ). In this  population of patient with less severe CVD, we did not observe  PRCP  SNPs as risk factors. Our investigations were consistent  with the investigations of Wu et al. who showed that the G allele  of SNP rs710980 was associated with susceptibility for essential  hypertension in 1020 Han Chinese ( 20 ). However, our present  study has results that do not meet the significance level set by our  investigations’ parameters. The implication of these data may be  that polymorphisms in PRCP may be significant in patients with  more serious hypertensive CVD than those investigated in the  present study.  

Furthermore, our studies like others did not show any significant association with the rs2298668  PRCP  polymorphism  (E112D PRCP) that was associated with chronic hypertension  with or without increased risk of pre e clamps i a or resistance to an  ACE-inhibitor therapy for hypertension ( 18 ,  19 ). First, the studies  of Wang et al. and Zhang et al. were with patients who had more  advanced hypertension and signs of deteriorating cardiovascular  health than the subjects examined in the present report ( 18 ,  19 ).  This difference also accounts for the different results with SNP  rs2298668 between these two studies and the one of Wu et al.  ( 18 – 20 ). The investigation of Wu et al. used subjects who just had  essential hypertension without history of diabetes mellitus, MI,  cerebro vascular accident, or other serious diseases ( 20 ). Finally,  since previous studies with SNPs rs7104980 and rs2298668 were  performed on Asian and African-Americans subjects, respectively, the non-statistically significant results observed in the  present study also may be related to the mostly male Caucasian  population examined.  

When we performed this investigation, we were concerned  whether we were able to get adequate DNA from stored plasma  samples. We avoided serum samples for DNA preparation in  this investigation since it has been associated with degraded  DNA ( 30 ). We reasoned that well-collected plasma samples  properly stored preserves soluble DNA for adequate preparation  for assay like it does for study of blood coagulation zymogens.  Our studies show that the genotyping error rate of  $5–8.4\%$   in the  DNA prepared from subject plasma samples is less than that of   $6.2\substack{-13\%}$   error rate in control DNA prepared from tissue across  the SNPs.  

Another caution in interpreting these findings is that this  investigation is based only on a single cross-sectional study of  samples. It needs to be confirmed by similar investigations on  additional sample sets. Furthermore, the results of this crosssectional study should be confirmed in a case-controlled study to  obviate any unintended selection bias.  

In sum, we postulate that the G allele of a  KLKB1  SNP,  rs3733402, is associated with reduced hypertension and  coronary artery disease. These data suggest that reduction of  PK activity may reduce CVD consistent with our previous  studies in diabetic patients ( 8 ,  9 ). Our current findings also are  consistent with our murine models. In our animal models, PK  and PRCP may have opposing activities in the cardiovascular  system regulating our risks for arterial disease. Reduction of PK  or elevation of PRCP may be future targets to promote vascular  health to reduce CVD.  

# CONCLUSION  

This paper is the first cross-sectional investigation on two  KLKB1 SNPs on a group of patients with mild CVD. When subject age,  male gender, and weight are taken into account,  KLKB1  SNP  rs3733402 significantly associates with those with a reduced  history of ang io graphic coronary artery disease. When subjects  have covariates of age, weight, gender, hypertension, rs3733402  best associates with those individuals who both have a reduced  history of angina. Rs3733402, an exonic SNP that is associated  with reduced PK activation, also is associated with reduced CVD.
