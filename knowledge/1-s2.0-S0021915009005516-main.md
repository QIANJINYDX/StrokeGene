Background:  Genetic factors contribute to the development of ischemic stroke (IS). In order to identify susceptibility variants, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that had been previously linked to stroke in a genome-wide association study. Methods:  We analyzed 12 SNPs in a White population comprising IS patients and healthy controls. The analysis was adjusted for confounding variables and stratiﬁed by stroke etiology. Functional studies were then performed to elucidate the role of these variants in IS. Results:  In a preliminary analysis of 268 controls and 531 IS cases, the rs10947803 SNP of  KCNK17  (  $\cdot_{\textstyle p\,=\,0.012}$  ) and the rs7506045 of  IMPA2  (  $\dot{\boldsymbol{p}}\!=\!0.040\big)$   were associated with IS, although only the  KCNK17  gene was an independent risk factor for IS. In a second phase, analysis of 271 new IS cases revealed that the A allele of rs10947803 was associated with stroke after correction for Bonferroni (  $\mathbf{\dot{O}R}=1.48$  ;  $95\%$   CI, 1.14–1.91,  $p\!=\!0.003.$  ). Gene expression analysis revealed that  KCNK17  mRNA levels were higher in the IS cases in the acute phase than in controls   $\cdot14\pm78\%$   vs.  $91\pm41$  ,  $p\!=\!0.002$  ) but not in the chronic phase   $'56\pm57\%$  ;  $p\!=\!0.230)$  . Moreover, RNA levels depended on the alleles of the rs10947803 SNP in the control group  $(p\!=\!0.021$  ) and in the chronic phase   $\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathbf{\varepsilon}}(p\!=\!0.033)}\end{array}$  ). Conclusions:  The A allele of the rs10947803 variant of  KCNK17  was associated with increased risk of IS and increased levels of  KCNK17  gene expression. The role of this potassium channel gene in IS opens diagnostic and therapeutic expectations and merits further investigation.

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke is the 2nd most common cause of death in developed countries, and thus is a major health problem  [1,2] . It is a complex disease resulting from the interaction of many genetic and environmental factors  [3] . Whole genome linkage analysis highlighted a role for the  PDE4D  and  ALOX5AP  genes in ischemic stroke (IS)  [4–6] . However, the replication of these results across populations and the ident i cation of other susceptibility variants through candidate gene approach have proven difﬁcult, in part because each gene only makes a small contribution to the overall heritability  [7] . Nonetheless, the candidate gene approach per  

Nowadays, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) permit to screen about  $95\%$   of the human genome in an unbiased manner, allowing the ident i cation of totally new susceptibility factors. However, the incredible amount of data produced makes it difﬁ- cult to distinguish between true and false positive variants, even with the availability of potent statistical tools  [11–13] . One of the solutions to that challenge is the replication of the associations observed by GWAS in other populations. Very few GWAS have been performed up to date in the genetics of stroke  [14–18] . Matarín et al. published in 2007 the ﬁrst GWA study in IS analyzing more than 400,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in about 550 subjects  [14] . While no single locus conferring a large effect on risk for IS was identiﬁed, as to be expected, some of the most signiﬁcant SNPs brought out were located within or near interesting candidate genes. Interestingly, they observed association with two genes involved in potassium transport,  Kv channel interacting protein 4  (KCNIP4) and  potassium channel ,  subfamily K ,  member 17 (KCNK17), with the  astro tact in  (ASTN2) involved in neuronal adhesion and with the  spermatogenesis associated 13  (SPATA13), located in the same locus as the  ALOX5AP  (13q12).  

Therefore, in an attempt to identify genetic variants associated with IS, we genotyped in a large European cohort a total of twelve SNPs relevant for their location in ten different genes selected from the most statistically signiﬁcant results from Matarín et al. and performed functional studies to try to elucidate the role of these variants in IS.  

# 2. Material and methods  

# 2.1. Genetic analysis  

A case-control study design was used. The IS cases were ascertained and collected as described in Montaner et al.  [19] . Brieﬂy, 531 consecutive patients who had a basilar or middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion assessed by trans cranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) were recruited. The control participants were 268 healthy volunteers elder than 65 years, classiﬁed free of neurovascular and cardiovascular history, as well as familial history of stroke, by direct interview before recruitment. Details on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were obtained from all subjects by questionnaires, together with information on smoking, dys lipid emi a, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and current medication use. Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects, and the local Ethics Committee approved the study. All subjects were of Spanish White ancestry. Etiologic subgroups were determined following the TOAST criteria (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment)  [20] .  

Genomic DNA was extracted for each subject from 1 mL of peripheral blood anti-coagulated with EDTA by standard methods. Twelve SNPs in ten genes were selected from the Matarín et al. study  [14]  and were genotyped by Sequenom ®   SNP detection system based on MALDI-TOF MS technique at the Spanish National Genotyping Centre (CeGen): rs2118844 of the  MGAT5 , rs10497212 of the  ITGB6 , rs10204475 of the  ZNF650 , rs4697177 of the  KCNIP4 , rs10947803 (also called rs9471058) and rs10807204 of the  KCNK17 , rs783396 of the  AIM1 , rs3761845 and rs10817974 of the  ASTN2 , rs2793483 of the  SPATA13 , rs229673 of the  SPTB  and rs7506045 of the  IMPA2 .  

The rs10947803 SNP of the  KCNK17  gene was then genotyped by TaqMan Real Time PCR (C 1650896, Applied Biosystems Inc.) in a new cohort of a the roth ombo tic   $(n=115)$  ) and lacunar   $(n=156)$  stroke cases to replicate the results obtained and perform stratiﬁcation for stroke etiologies. The patients were recruited from an ongoing stroke cohort of patients that presented to the Vall d’Hebron Hospital with any type of stroke and were classiﬁed, recruited and collected similarly to the former IS cases.  

# 2.2. Functional analysis  

Expression analysis was performed for the  KCNK17  gene. RNA was extracted from 13 healthy controls, 15 IS cases in which blood samples were obtained in the acute phase, less than  $_{3\,\mathrm{h}}$  after stroke symptoms onset and 12 IS cases in which blood samples were obtained 3 months after stroke. The white blood cell fraction was preserved in RNA later ®   (Ambion) at    $-80\,^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   and total RNA was isolated by RiboPure-Blood TM   Kit (Ambion). cDNA synthesis was performed using High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc.). mRNA levels were determined by quantitative Real Time PCR, using a standard TaqMan ®   PCR kit protocol and TaqMan ﬂuorogenic probes with a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The probes were located in the KCNK17  (Hs00230249 m1) and the  Cy clo phil in A  (PPIA) genes (Hs99999904 m1); the latter ran as housekeeping gene to normalize the results. All reactions were run in triplicate on three 96-well plates, using a unique sample as endogenous calibrator control in each one, and analyzed using the Applied Biosystems SDS 7500 system software (Applied Biosystems, USA). The results are expressed in percentage depending on a calibrator sample used in all experiments.  

Screening of the  KCNK17  gene was then performed by sequencing the linkage d is equilibrium (LD) region of the rs10947803 SNP, encoding exons 3 and 4. This region was determined using the HapMap Genome Browser Phase 3 data with an    $r^{2}$    of 0.8. PCR was carried out for 15 samples and PCR products were analyzed by direct sequencing (did e oxy nucleotide-sequencing method ABI Prism BigDye Terminator 3.0, Applied Biosystems) and conﬁrmed by sequencing of the second strand. The primer sequences were designed as follows: forward:  $5^{\prime}$  -T GAGA G GTA TAG GC A GCC GA AT $.3^{\prime}$  ; reverse:   $5^{\prime}$  -TTC TA A CCC ACT G TAG AT GT GG GC $.3^{\prime}$  . Similarly, screening of the  KCNK17  mRNA was performed by sequencing a region comprising exons 3 and 4 in 15 samples, using cDNA. The forward primer (  $5^{\prime}$  -GC TG AT CCG GG AT GTC GTC CAA $.3^{\prime}$  ) was located at the junction between exons 1 and 2, and the reverse primer   $(5^{\prime}\cdot$  - AAA GAG GAT C CACA GG GAC ACC AT $.3^{\prime}$  ) was located in exon 5.  

# 2.3. Statistical methods  

Sample size calculation was performed using the Ene 2.0 software. Deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was assessed using a  $\chi2$   test with 1 degree of freedom. A    $\chi2$   or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate, was used to compare categorical variables between groups. Continuous variables were compared with the Student’s  t -test. The odd ratios (OR) and  $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for the effect on IS risk were estimated using logistic regression analysis adjusted for the effects of conventional risk factors. To account for multiple statistical testing, Bonferroni’s correction was applied and false discovery rate (FDR)    $q$  -values were calculated. The  $S P S S^{\copyright}$    statistical software package version 15.0 was used for all statistical analysis.

# 3.1. Case-control study  

12 SNPs located in 10 candidate genes were examined for association with IS. Sample size was calculated to obtain a power of 0.80 with a sign i can ce level of 0.05 using the mean allele frequencies of the 12 SNPs from the Matarín et al. study. The minimal sample size necessary was 456 subjects and 225 controls. Finally, 531 patients with an acute IS and 268 control subjects were included in the analyzes. Established risk factors, including gender (male), diabetes, hypertension and cigarette smoking were observed at a higher frequency in the IS group while age and dys lipid emi c status did not differ between the two groups, although the control group included slightly elder subjects ( Table 1 ). Etiologic subgroups of our patients, as deﬁned by the TOAST criteria, revealed that about  $50\%$   of cases were of card i oem boli c etiology   $(n\!=\!242)$  ),  $23\%$   were a the roth rom bot ic   $'n=125,$  ) and   $27\%$   were of undetermined cause  $(n=133)$  ).

Genotype frequencies did not differ sign i cant ly from those predicted by the HWE in the control group, except for the rs4697177 SNP in the  KCNIP4  gene ( Table 2 ). Two SNPs were associated with IS considering an additive model, the rs10947803 of the  KCNK17  gene with an OR of 1.42 (  $95\%$   CI: 1.08–1.88;  $p\!=\!0.012,$  ) and the rs7506045 of the  IMPA2  gene with an OR of 1.57   $95\%$   CI: 1.02–2.42;  $p\!=\!0.040!$  ). Moreover, two SNPs presented a trend for association, one located in the  KCNK17  gene as well, the rs10807204 with an OR of 1.28   $.95\%$   CI: 0.97–1.68;  $p\!=\!0.060!$  ), and the other one located in the  MGAT5  gene with an OR of 1.22 (  $95\%$   CI: 0.97–1.55;  $p\!=\!0.095,$  ). Using the FDR correction for multiple testing, both SNPs rs10947803 in the  KCNK17 and rs7506045 in the  IMPA2  genes presented a    $q$  -value inferior to 0.25, but none presented a  $q$  -value inferior to 0.05. The rs10947803 SNP in the  KCNK17  gene presented a minor allele frequency (MAF) of  $18\%$   in controls compared to  $23\%$   in cases, and the rs7506045 in the  IMPA2  gene presented a MAF of  $6\%$   in controls compared to  $9\%$  in IS cases. However, none of them resisted correction for multiple testing by Bonferroni.  

We also examined the association of the conventional risk factors for IS with the two SNPs located in the  KCNK17  gene and the SNP in the  IMPA2  gene ( Table 3 ). Smoking was associated with the rs10947803 and the rs10807204 SNPs in the overall population  $\dot{p}\!=\!0.046$   and  $p\,{=}\,0.037$  , respectively) and the rs7506045 was associated with diabetes mellitus   $\mathbf{\zeta}_{\boldsymbol{p}}\!=\!0.010.$  ). When looking at IS cases only, no association with IS risk factors was observed.  

In order to examine the effect of the rs10947803 SNP on the different stroke etiologies, we stratiﬁed the analysis by stroke subtypes using the TOAST criteria, and performed different statistical models, genotypic, dominant and allelic, as shown in  Table 4 . In particular, the allelic model ﬁtted in a multivariate analysis adjusting for gender, age, diabetes, smoking and hypertension showed that the A allele of the rs10947803 SNP was an independent risk factor for stroke with an OR of 1.47 (  $95\%$   CI: 1.10–1.97;  $p\!=\!0.010$  ) and that this association remained signiﬁcant in the card i oem boli c group, with an adjusted OR of 1.47 (  $95\%$   CI: 1.10–1.97;  $p\!=\!0.013$  ) and in the undetermined group with an OR of 1.52 (  $\mathbf{\Delta}[95\%$   CI: 1.01–2.27;  $p\,{=}\,0.042)$  .  

In an effort to replicate the results obtained with the rs10947803 SNP and analyze other stroke etiologies, we recruited 271 new IS cases, divided in 115 a the roth rom bot ic strokes and 156 lacunar strokes ( Suppl. Table 1 ). In this stage 2 analysis, we replicated the association of the rs10947803 SNP with stroke (  $[0\tt R=1.57$  ;   $95\%$   CI: 1.16–2.11;  $p\!=\!0.003$  ). However, the association did not remain after adjustment for conventional stroke risk factors (  $\mathbf{\dot{O}}\mathbf{R}=1.32$  ;   $95\%$   CI:  $0.95{-}1.84$  ;  $p\!=\!0.097]$  ). In the a the roth rom bot ic group, we observed an association with an  $\mathrm{0R}\,{=}\,1.61$   (  $.95\%C I$  : 1.11–2.34,  $p\!=\!0.011$  ) and in the lacunar group, we observed an association with an   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.54$  (  $.95\%C I$  : 1.10–2.17,  $p\!=\!0.012,$  .  

Finally, when combining all the results obtained, we observed that the rs10947803 SNP of the  KCNK17  gene was a risk factor for IS with an OR of 1.48 (  $95\%$   CI: 1.14–1.91;  $p\!=\!0.003\bigstar$  ) and this association resisted Bonferroni and FDR correction   $(p_{\mathrm{corr}}\!=\!0.003\times12\!=\!0.036)$  . Strat i cation by stroke etiologies showed that this association was observed in all etiologies (card i oem boli c,   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.50$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 1.09–2.07;    $p\!=\!0.012$  ; a the roth rom bot ic,   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.45$  ;   $95\%$  CI: 1.05–1.90;    $p\!=\!0.023$  ; lacunar,   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.54$  ;   $95\%$   CI: 1.10–2.17;  $p\!=\!0.012$  ; and undetermined,  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.46$  ;  $95\%$  CI: 1.00–2.12;  $p\!=\!0.048,$  .  

Logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, diabetes, smoking and hypertension revealed that the rs10947803 SNP was an independent risk factor for stroke in the overall population with an  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.42$  (  $95\%$   CI: 1.08–1.86;  $p\!=\!0.012$  ) and in the card i oem boli c and undetermined subtypes, but not in the a the roth rom bot ic and lacunar stroke subtypes ( Table 4  and  Suppl. Table 2 ).  

Our ﬁnal sample size, considering a frequency of the A allele of 0.18 in the control group and 0.24 in the IS cases group and a proportion of the control group of 0.37 compared to the IS cases group (  $\cdot n\!=\!259$   vs.  $n\!=\!695$  ), had a power of 0.80 to detect an association of the rs10947803 SNP of the  KCNK17  gene with a sign i can ce level of 0.05.

IS cases in the chronic phase, 3 months after stroke onset ( Fig. 1 A). A signiﬁcant difference in the mean relative levels of RNA expression could be observed between controls and IS cases in the acute phase   $(p\!=\!0.002)$  , IS cases showing higher levels   $(147\pm78\%)$   than controls   $(91\pm41\%)$  . RNA levels did not differ between stroke etiologies (card i oem boli c:   $112\pm85$  ,  $n\,{=}\,17,$  , a the roth ombo tic:   $111\pm56$  ,  $n\!=\!4$  , undetermined: 109,  $n\!=\!5$  ;  $p\!=\!0.994)$  ). However, gene expression measured in IS cases in the chronic phase revealed that KCNK17 mRNA levels were back to levels comparable s to the controls 3 months after stroke onset   $\cdot56\pm57\%$  ;    $p\!=\!0.230.$  ). Gene expression levels were statistically lower at 3 months than in the acute phase in IS cases (  $\begin{array}{r}{{'}p\!=\!0.0003.}\end{array}$  ).  

Moreover, RNA levels depended on the alleles of the rs10947803 SNP in the control group   $\left(p\!=\!0.021\right)$  ), with A carriers presenting higher levels than C carriers (  $\cdot114\pm35\%$  ,  $n\!=\!5$   vs.   $77\pm38\%$  ,  $n\!=\!8$  ) ( Fig. 1 B). This association was found also in the IS cases group in the chronic phase   $(87\pm83\%$  ,  $n\!=\!4$   vs.   $37\pm21\%$  ,  $n\!=\!8$  ;  $p\!=\!0.033]$  ). However, no association between  KCNK17  RNA levels and rs10947803 alleles could be observed in the IS group in the acute phase   $(p\!=\!0.424)$  . Levels of expression differed between controls (  $110\pm35\%$  ;  $n\!=\!5$  ) and cases in the acute phase carrying the A allele

# 3.3. KCNK17 DNA and RNA screening  

The region of the  KCNK17  gene in linkage d is equilibrium with the rs10947803 SNP included exons 3 and 4 of the  KCNK17  gene and a non-synonymous serine to proline mutation in position 124 in exon 3, rs41273130. We thus developed primers to analyze this region, however sequencing of 15 IS patients (divided in 3 groups for each rs10947803 genotype) did not reveal the presence of the serine to proline mutation, nor any other polymorphism. Similarly, sequencing of the mRNA of the same 15 individuals did not reveal changes in the splicing patterns of the KCNK17  gene.  

# 4. Discussion  

In an effort to elucidate the identity of the genetic factors implicated in stroke, we performed a case-control study and genotyped 12 SNPs, selected from a GWA study by Matarín et al., in 531 cases and 268 controls of IS  [14] . For most of the SNPs studied, we could not observe an association with IS in our population. However, using an adjusted additive model, the A allele of the rs10947803 SNP of the  KCNK17  gene was independently associated with IS with an OR of 1.47 (  $95\%$   $p\!=\!0.010$  al. described a MAF for the rs10947803 SNP of 0.18 in their control samples, similarly to our control population, and a MAF of 0.28 in their cases while we observed a MAF of 0.24. Since both sets of populations were of White ancestry, the variation between the two studies might originate from the different proportions of etiologies of IS used. We also observed a trend for association of another SNP located in the  KCNK17  gene, rs10807204, with an OR of 1.28   $95\%$   CI: 0.97–1.68,  $p\!=\!0.060)$  ), which became statistically signiﬁcant after adjusting for conventional IS risk factors with an OR of 1.36   $95\%$   CI: 1.02–1.83,    $p\!=\!0.039$  ). In addition, both SNPs rs10947803 and rs10807204 are in strong linkage d is equilibrium (  $|D^{\prime}|=1$   and  $r^{2}\,{=}\,0.945)$  ), thus supporting a role for the  KCNK17  gene in IS.  

Considering the frequencies we obtained in our population and the sample size we used   $'n\!=\!684,$  ), the ﬁnal theoretical power to observe an association of the rs10947803 SNP was of 0.62 which was lower than expected and suggested that with an adequate sample size, the association observed would have been much stronger. After increasing our sample size with 271 new IS cases to obtain a power of 0.80   $\cdot n\!=\!954,$  ), we observed that the A allele of the rs10947803 SNP was associated with stroke and this association resisted Bonferroni correction with an OR of 1.48 (  $95\%$   CI: 1.14–1.91,  $p\!=\!0.003.$  ). Moreover, this association was independent of stroke risk factors with an adjusted OR of 1.42 (  $95\%$   $p\!=\!0.012]$  ). Strat i cation by stroke etiologies revealed that the rs10947803 SNP was associated with all types of strokes, although the association was independent from other risk factors in the card i oem boli c and undetermined strokes only.  

Little is known about the  KCNK17  gene, which was cloned in 2001 by Decher et al. and mapped to chromosome 6p21.2-p21.1  [21] . The gene is composed by 5 exons spamming around 1600 base-pairs (bp) and the rs10947803 SNP is located in the fourth intron of the gene, 1134 bp from exon 4  [22] . Tissue distribution studied through retro-transcription PCR revealed that it was expressed widely, but especially in liver, lung, placenta, pancreas, small intestine and aorta. Intermediate levels were also detected in brain, heart, colon, ovary, peripheral blood leukocytes, prostate, spleen, testis, and thymus but not in skeletal muscle  [21] . Within the heart,  KCNK17  was expressed in both atria, the auricles and in the atrio ventricular node. A faint signal was detected in the inter ventricular septum, but no signal was detected in the ventricles, apex, or in fetal heart [21] .  

With the intention of understanding better the role that the KCNK17  gene could have in the ph y sio pathology of IS, we analyzed KCNK17  gene expression. Among healthy controls, we observed an interesting difference in  KCNK17  gene expression depending on the rs10947803 alleles, A carriers presenting higher levels of  KCNK17 mRNA than C carriers. Since the A allele of this SNP is independently associated with IS and to higher mRNA levels in our control population, it is possible that higher mRNA levels of the  KCNK17  gene are associated with a higher risk of IS. We then analyzed  KCNK17 gene expression in IS cases in the acute phase and 3 months after stroke onset and noticed that IS cases showed higher levels than controls in the acute phase and had levels similar to controls in the chronic phase.  KCNK17  gene expression was not different between A and C allele carriers in stroke patients in the acute phase, but in the chronic phase, levels of KCNK17 were higher in the A carriers than C carriers, similarly to what we could observe in our group of healthy controls. The results obtained with blood samples from the IS cases drawn in the acute phase could thus reﬂect a process that is speciﬁc to this stage of the disease. This information is nonetheless intriguing and merits further investigation, such as measuring  KCNK17  gene expression prospectively, to discern if  KCNK17  gene levels could serve as a biomarker for IS, or if the difference in levels observed is due to stroke instead of precipitating the event. Moreover,  KCNK17  gene expression in peripheral blood cells might be different from its expression in other organs, and it would be interesting to study cells extracted from other tissues.  

Unfortunately, the way the rs10947803 variant functions exactly is unknown. This SNP is located in intron 4 and thus does not belong to the promoter region, but affects  KCNK17  mRNA levels with an unknown mechanism. From analysis of the linkage region of this SNP, we could not identify any variant in linkage d is equilibrium with it, indicating that the rs10947803 SNP is probably the functional variant associated with  KCNK17  mRNA levels and higher risk of ischemic stroke. Sequencing of the mRNA of ﬁfteen patients did not show any splicing error, such as exons skipping, insertion or deletion.  

The protein coded by the  KCNK17  gene, called TALK-2 or TASK4, is a member of the 2-pore domain superfamily of   $\mathrm{K^{+}}$    channels [21,22] . Those channels participate in ion ﬂuxes necessary for cell volume regulation as well as in metabolic acidosis and hypotension caused by secretion of   ${\mathrm{H}}C O^{-3}$    [23–26] . Recently, channels of the TASK-1 family have been shown to present a neuroprotective function in cerebral ischemia  [27,28] . When we stratiﬁed our genetic analysis according to IS etiology, the association we observed remained statistically signiﬁcant in all subtypes of IS. These channels, considering their function and localization in a wide range of tissues, might then play an important role in ischemic stroke, and might be a main trigger common to all stroke subtypes.  

In summary, the present study suggests that the  KCNK17  gene might contribute to the elucidation of the complex mechanisms of neuro vascular diseases and their genetic components. Additional functional studies around this potassium channel gene and protein might help to understand the exact contribution of the described variant to the susceptibility of the disease and permit diagnostic and therapeutic advances in the area of stroke.
