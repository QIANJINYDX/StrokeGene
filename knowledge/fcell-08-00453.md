Li X, Shi W, Zhang R, Zhang S, Hou W, Wu Y, Lu R, Feng Y, Tian J and Sun L (2020) Integrate Molecular Phenome and Polygenic Interaction to Detect the Genetic Risk of Ischemic Stroke. Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 8:453. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00453 Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the leading causes of death, and the genetic risk of which are continuously calculated and detected by association study of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the phenotype relations. However, the systematic assessment of IS risk still needs the accumulation of molecular phenotype and function from the level of omics. In this study, we integrated IS phenome, polygenic interaction gene expression and molecular function to screen the risk gene and molecular function. Then, we performed a case-control study including 507 cases and 503 controls to verify the genetic associated relationship among the candidate functional genes and the IS phenotype in a northern Chinese Han population. Mediation analysis revealed that the blood pressure, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and glucose mediated the potential effect of SOCS1, CD137, ALOX5AP, RNLS, and KALRN in IS, both for the functional analysis and genetic association. And the SNP-SNP interactions analysis by multi factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) approach also presented a combination effect of IS risk. The further interaction network and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggested that CD137 and KALRN functioning in in amma tory could play an expanded role during the pathogen es is and progression of IS. The present study opens a new avenue to evaluate the underlying mechanisms and biomarkers of IS through integrating multiple omics information.

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is one of the three most common causes of death, and a major cause of adult disability in developed and developing countries, accounting for almost 6.5 million stroke deaths each year, and its global burden continues to grow ( Endres et al., 2011 ;  Bejot et al., 2016 ). The majority of global stroke burden is in low-income and middle-income countries. About   $87\%$  of all strokes are ischemic stroke (IS) and occurs when there is an obstruction in the blood vessel resulting in irreversible brain injury ( Benjamin et al., 2019 ). Hence, there is a need to develop an eﬀective prevention approach for stroke, which necessitates a better understanding of the underlying risk factors.  

Omics data play a key role in evaluating the underlying mechanisms and predicting biomarkers. IS is a heterogeneous syndrome, many risk factors such as hyper lipid emi a, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and in amma tion have been conﬁrmed as the important roles in the development of IS ( O’Donnell et al., 2016 ;  Beheshti et al., 2018 ). Evidence from studies of twins and family history demonstrates that genetics also inﬂuences the pathogen es is of IS and it should be responsible for a large part of IS risk ( Dichgans and Markus, 2005 ;  Traylor et al., 2012 ). More recently, the data from genomewide association study (GWAS) have shown that dozens single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are related to IS ( Matarin et al., 2007 ), however, these identiﬁed loci could explain only a small fraction of susceptibility. The genetic factor operates through a mechanism involving multiple genes, and is also aﬀected by environmental factors ( Dichgans and Markus, 2005 ), besides, the risk attributable to any individual variant has been modest. Furthermore, SNP and IS in a non-linear manner, the relevant risk factors have been frequently observed in the modulation eﬀects of SNP on IS. Previous studies have focus on the single omics and research on SNP has been largely limited on single loci. Nevertheless, computational analysis provides a good way to understand the interactions between diﬀerent factors that may contribute to IS occurrence. Some reports have shown that network analysis of SNP related dys regulated expression are associated with complicated diseases including IS. Importantly, fully understand the genetic factors in a multi-omics perspective helps to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to IS. This study aimed to explore the combined eﬀect of SNP from multiple genes and their interaction with risk factors in the development of IS. Furthermore, we also performed functional analyses of the selected genes at the transcript ome.  

14 SNPs in RNLS, ALOX5AP, CD137, KALRN and SOCS1 were selected in the present study. The 5 genes involved in hypertension, in amma tion, atherosclerosis and so on, and have been linked to IS in previous studies ( Helga do ttir et al., 2004 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ;  Dang et al., 2015 ;  Ma et al., 2016 ;  Zhang et al., 2017 ). Including: rs10887800, rs2576178 and rs2296545 in the gene RNLS (renalase); rs4073259 in the gene ALOX5AP (ara chi donate 5-lip oxygen as e activating protein); rs17286604, rs7620580, rs11712619 and rs6438833 in the gene KALRN (kalirin RhoGEF kinase); rs243327, rs243330 and rs33932899 in the gene SOCS1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1); and rs161827, rs161818 and rs161810 in the gene CD137 (TNF receptor superfamily member 9). The relationship between SNP genotypes and IS risk factors were examined, we used mediation analysis to investigate the risk factors in the mediation eﬀect on the association between SNP and the IS. And the casecontrol analysis of SNP-SNP interactions in the MDR approach was applied. Furthermore, the RNLS, ALOX5AP, CD137, KALRN and SOCS1 related mRNA interaction network was constructed and gene ontology (GO)functional annotation was implemented. Our study could provide theoretical foundation and reliably biomarkers for the mechanism involved in the pathogen es is of IS.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Case-Control Subjects and Clinical Characteristics  

A total of 507 unrelated patients with IS from the northeastern Chinese Han population were consecutively recruited from the same center (Neurology Department, 2nd Aﬃliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University) and included in this study. All recruited patients were diagnosed by an experienced neurologist according to their clinical features and by auxiliary diagnosis, including computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and routine laboratory tests. Subjects with infection, cerebro vascular malformation, autoimmune disease and history of takayasu arteritis were excluded from the study. In the case subjects, 311 subjects had hypertension, 112 subjects had diabetes and 68 subjects suﬀered from heart disease. Based on the Trial of   $\mathrm{{Arg}~10172}$   in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) class i cation the IS patients were further categorized into at hero thrombosis subtype, lacunar infarction subtype and both at hero thrombosis and lacunar infarction subtype( Adams et al., 1993 ).  

The control group consisted of 503 unrelated gender-matched and geography-matched healthy individuals from the Health Medical Center, they were without stroke, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and other central nervous system disorders.  

All of the cases and controls agreed with the ethics of the study and signed informed consent. The research was approved by the ethics committee of 2nd Aﬃliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University.  

# Sequencing Genotyping of Selected SNP in Case-Control Samples  

All the SNP genotyping experiments were performed by the Shanghai BioWing Applied Biotechnology Company 1   using the ligase detection reaction (LDR) ( Huang et al., 2008 ). The target DNA sequences were ampliﬁed using a multiplex PCR-based method. The primer DNA sequences are shown in  Table 1 .  

Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA-anti coagulated blood and the DNA samples were ampliﬁed in a   $20~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   reaction mixtur  $2\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   of   $1~\times$   buﬀer,   $50\;\mathrm{\textmu n g}$   of genomic DNA, 0.6  $0.6~\ensuremath{\,\upmu\mathrm{l}\,}~\ensuremath{\mathrm{Mg}}^{2\ensuremath{\,+}}$     $(3.0\,\mathrm{\mmol/l})$  ),   $2\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   of de oxy nucleotide triphosphate s (  $(2.0\,\mathrm{\mmol/l})$  ,   $2\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   of dNTP,   $0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   of 1U Taq Polymerase and   $12.2\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   of   $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O}$  ) by PCR. PCR amp li cation was applied to a thermal cycler in the Gene Amp PCR system 9600 (PERKIN ELMER). The primary information of the probes is shown in  Table 2 . The LDR was performed in a   $10~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   react mixt  $1\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   $1~\times$   buﬀer,   $1\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   of each probe mix 4  $4\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$  l of ddH  $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O,}$  O, 4  $4\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$  l multi-PCR product and   $0.05\ \ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   of 2U of Taq DNA ligase. The ﬂuorescent products of LDR were distinguished by an ABI sequencer 3730,

and the results were analyzed with SHEsis and Genemapper software. The quality of genotyping was controlled using blinded blood duplicates.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for genotypes were tested using the goodness of-ﬁt    $\upchi^{2}$    test.  

A mediation model was set up, with the risk factors (BMI, body mass index; systolic blood pressure, systolic BP; diastolic blood pressure, diastolic BP; glucose, Glu; TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein) as a mediator, to test the direct and indirect eﬀects of SNP (rs10887800, rs2576178, rs2296545, rs4073259, rs17286604, rs7620580, rs11712619, rs6438833, rs243327, rs243330, rs33932899, rs161827, rs161818, rs161810) on IS/IS subtypes. In this study, we used the   $\mathrm{~R~}\,3.5.3$   to perform the mediation analysis. Mediation model and conclusion model used glm function. Mediation package was used in quantitative analysis of mediation eﬀect. The model-based causal mediation analysis proceeds in two steps. First, the researcher speciﬁes two statistical models, the mediator model for the conditional distribution of the mediator  $M i$   given the treatment    $T i$   and a set of the observed pre-treatment covariates    $X i$   and the outcome model for the conditional distribution of the outcome    $Y i$   given  $T i,\ M i,$  , and    $X i$  . These models are ﬁtted separately and then their ﬁtted objects comprise the main inputs to the mediate function, which computes the estimated ACME and other quantities of interest under these models and the sequential ign or ability assumption.  

MDR analyses were implemented in the open-source MDR software package version   $3.0.2^{2}$  . This methodology can reveal high-order interactions among genes collaborating concerning a given phenotype, to determine multilocus genotype combinations associated with high or low risk of disease. The entropy-based clustering algorithm used by MDR sets a contingency table for   $\mathrm{~k~}\:\mathrm{SNP}$   and calculates case-control ratios for each of the possible multilocus genotypes. The prediction error of the model was evaluated by 10-folds cross-validation. The model with the smallest prediction error is selected as the ﬁnal model, and the average prediction error of 10 tests is taken as the unbiased estimation of model-related prediction error. The hypothesis tests of the best model use the substitution test to evaluate the cross-validation consistency and the size of the prediction error estimates.  

# Functional Enrichment Analysis  

Functional enrichment analysis at the GO level was performed using the R pachage cluster Pro ler. In our work, GO terms for “Biological Process” (GOTERM-BP-FAT) with a threshold of  $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}$  -value    $<0.05$   were considered signiﬁcant functional categories. Functional categories were visualized using DotPlot in R pachage cluster Pro ler.  

# Ident i cation of mRNA-Target Interactions  

The mRNA-miRNA interactions in our study were predicted with miRanda (version 3.3a) ( John et al., 2004 ), which predicted miRNA targets based on sequence complement ari ty, conserved target sites and free energy of formation. The input   $3^{\prime}\mathrm{UTR}$  sequences of mRNA from the Human (GRCh38) assembly were retrieved from the Ensembl database; the sequences of mature miRNA were downloaded from the miRBase database. To improve the reliability of miRNA target prediction, we used a maximum binding free energy of    $-20\;\mathrm{kcal/mol}$   for the miRNA target interaction predicted in miRanda.  

# Ident i cation of mRNA-mRNA Interactions  

To identify competing mRNA-mRNA interactions, we used a hyper geometric test which enabled the evaluation of the sign i can ce of the shared miRNAs between each mRNA. We

considered a    $\it{\Delta}p$  -value    $<~0.05$   as statistically signiﬁcant. The  $\it{\Delta}p$  -value was calculated as follows:  

$$
P-\nu a l u e=1-\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}\frac{\mathbb{G}_{t}^{i}\mathbb{G}_{m-t}^{n-i}}{\mathbb{G}_{m}^{n}}
$$  

where m is the number of miRNAs in the network, and r represents the number of miRNAs shared between mRNAs. The number of miRNAs interacting with the RNLS, ALOX5AP, CD137, KALRN and SOCS1 and the other mRNAs is represented by    $t$   and    $n_{z}$  , respectively.  

# Network Visualization and Topological Analysis  

We used Cytoscape software (version 3.8.0) to construct and visualize the network in this study. Several topological properties such as the node degree, betweenness and closeness were analyzed using the built-in Network Analyzer tool. The degree of a node is the number of edges that link to this node. Betweenness is a measure of the centrality of the node in a network, which is the number of shortest paths from each node to all others that pass through the node. The closeness of a node is the average length of the shortest path between the node and all other nodes in the network.  

# RESULTS  

# Study Population for the Analysis of Ischemic Stroke Onset

The associations between each SNP and risk factors of IS were analyzed in correlation method. The rs2576178 genotype   $\mathrm{(CC~+~CT}$   vs TT) was sign i cant ly related to drinking   $(p\,=\,0.0392)$  ). The rs2296545 genotype   $(\mathrm{GC\mathrm{~+~}C G}$   vs CC) was revealed to be sign i cant ly correlated with smoking   $(p=0.0267)$  ). The rs4073259 genotypes

 (AA vs AG vs GG) were sign i cant ly associated with HDL

  $(p~=~0.0013)$  ), and the GG    $^+$   AG genotype was sign i cant ly with HDL   $(p\,=\,0.0003)$   and blood glucose   $(p\,=\,0.0375)$  . The  $\mathrm{AA}+\mathrm{AC}$   genotype of rs4073259 was revealed to sign i cant ly with age   $(p\,=\,0.024)$  . The rs11712619 genotypes (CC vs CT) were sign i cant ly associated with HDL   $(p~=~0.0032)$  . The rs6438833 genotypes (AA vs AT vs TT) were associated with age   $(p=0.0485)$  ) and systolic BP   $(p=0.006)$  . And the   $\mathrm{TT+AT}$  genotype of rs6438833 was also associated with age   $\dot{\boldsymbol{p}}=0.0471$  ) and systolic BP   $(p~=~0.0099)$  . The rs161818 genotypes (AA vs AG vs GG) were associated with systolic BP   $\textstyle p\,=\,0.0377)$  . And the  $\mathrm{BG\+\Ad G}$   genotype of rs161818 was associated with systolic BP   $(p\,=\,0.0152)$  ) and diastolic BP   $(p\,=\,0.0242)$  ). The

  $\mathrm{GGG}+\mathrm{CG}$   genotype of rs33932899 was associated with drinking

  $(p~=~0.0365)$  . The rs161810 genotypes (AA vs AG vs GG) were associated with systolic BP   $(p\,=\,0.03)$   and diastolic BP  $(p=0.0497)$  ). The  $\mathrm{GGG}+\mathrm{AC}$   genotype of rs161810 was associated with systolic BP (  $\acute{p}=0.0149)$   and diastolic BP   $\acute{p}=0.0214)$  . The

  $\mathrm{CC}+\mathrm{CT}$   genotype of rs161827 was associated with systolic BP

  $\acute{p}=0.0272\AA$  ).  

The associations between the SNP and IS subtypes were also analyzed. The rs11712619 genotypes (CC vs TT) were associated with lacunar subtype of IS (0.0486). But no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found among the subtype of IS and the other SNP ( Supplementary Table 1 ).  

# The Mediating Effect of the Risk Factors on the Relation Between SNP and Ischemic Stroke  

In gene-risk factors-IS pathways the mediation models were set up, with the risk factors of the IS as a mediator, to test the direct and indirect eﬀects of SNP on IS, the results are illustrated in  Figure 1A . We found signiﬁcant mediating eﬀects in the systolic BP as mediator, from rs161818  $(p~=~0.014)$  , rs161810   $(p~=~0.012)$   and rs161827   $(p~=~0.04)$  to IS, respectively, but the direct eﬀect was no signiﬁcant. In addition, the diastolic BP as mediator we found signiﬁcant mediating eﬀects, from rs161810   $\acute{p}=0.028)$  , rs161818   $(p=0.038)$  to IS, respectively, but we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant direct eﬀects. From rs4073259   $(p~=~0.002)$   to IS, there was a signiﬁcant mediating eﬀects in the HDL as mediator, the direct eﬀects were no signiﬁcant eﬀects. The results suggest that the signiﬁcant mediating eﬀects are all complete mediating eﬀects.  

# The Mediating Effect of the Risk Factors on the Relation Between SNP and Ischemic Stroke Subtypes  

To test the direct and indirect eﬀects of SNP on IS subtypes, the mediation analysis was also performed in gene-risk factors-IS subtypes pathways. In gene-risk factors-at hero thrombosis subtype of IS path models the results are showed in  Figure 1B .

# SNP-SNP Interactions by MDR Analysis With the Risk of Ischemic Stroke  

Figure 2A shows the interaction graph (a), interaction dendrogram (b) and histograms (c) for the whole genotypic data set, as resulting from MDR analysis. In this way, we explored whether there are signiﬁcant SNP-SNP interactions between diﬀerent SNP belonging to diﬀerent genes in this article. A signiﬁcant interaction model was found among rs161818, rs10887800 and rs4073259, and driving the high-risk combinations for IS   $(p~\mathrm{~<~}~0.0001$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}~=~1.9893$  ,  $95\%\mathrm{CI}\;\;=\;\;[1.5355{-}2.5773])$  . We found another signiﬁcant epistasis between rs10887800 and rs4073259   $(p~=~0.0008$  ,  $\mathrm{{OR}~=~1.5539}$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}\ =\ [1.2013,\ 2.0101]\rangle$  ). And the rs243327 has the largest univariate eﬀect  $(0.35\%$  of explained entropy in the network) as the high-risk combinations for IS  $\begin{array}{l l l}{(p}&{=}&{0.0412}\end{array}$   $\mathrm{OR}\quad=\quad1.3166$   $95\%\mathrm{CI}\;\;=\;\;\;[1.0108,$  1.715]).  

# Combined Effects of the Associated SNP With the Risk of Ischemic Stroke Subtype  

We then further explore the epistatic interactions between diﬀerent SNP in regard to IS subtype risk. The rs161818, rs243327, and rs10887800  $\begin{array}{r l r}{(p}&{{}<}&{0.0001}\end{array}$   $\begin{array}{l l l}{{\mathrm{OR}}}&{{=}}&{{2.9428,}}\end{array}$   $95\%\mathrm{CI}\,=\,[1.7676,\,4.8995])$  ) performed a signiﬁcant interaction model for at hero thrombosis subtype of IS risk. Another signiﬁcant interaction model for at hero thrombosis subtype of IS risk we found is between rs243327 and rs10887800  $(p\ \ =\ \ 0.0055$   $0.0055,\ \ \mathrm{OR}\ \ =\ \ 2.1287,\ \ 95\%\mathrm{CI}\ \ =\ \ [1.2371,\ \ 3.6628])$  , Figure 2B . For lacunar IS, we found two signiﬁcant risk interaction model, they are rs10887800, rs4073259  $(p~=~0.0001$  ,   $\mathrm{{OR}~=~1.7628,}$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}\;=\;$   [1.3171, 2.3593]) and rs161818, rs10887800, rs4073259   $(p~<~0.0001$  ,   $\mathrm{{OR}\ =\ 2.1871}$  ,  $95\%\mathrm{CI}=[1.6304,\,2.9339]\rangle$  ), respectively ( Figure 2C ).  Figure 2D display the SNP-SNP interactions aﬀection on combination subtype of IS, the SNP-SNP combinations jointly explain the rs10887800 SNP having the largest univariate eﬀect  $(0.58\%$   of explained entropy in the network). In this subdata set, two meaningful SNP-SNP interaction models were found: one between rs10887800 and rs6438833   $(p~=~0.0014$  ,  $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,2.0527}$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}\;=\;\left[1.3142,\;3.2061\right])$  , and another among rs161818, rs2576178 and rs7620580   $\mathit{\check{p}}\,<\,0.0001$  ,   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,3.034}$  ,  $95\%\mathrm{CI}$   [1.8776, 4.9025]), all as the high-risk combinations for combination subtype of IS.  

# GO Functional Annotation and Topological Analysis of the mRNA Interaction Networks  

To investigate the potential functional implication of RNLS, ALOX5AP, CD137, KALRN and SOCS1 in IS, we performed GO functional enrichment analysis for the ﬁve genes. We extracted the mRNAs related to the function of the ﬁve genes based on GO biological process terms. We identiﬁed putative miRNA-mRNA interactions using the miRanda software. We next used miRNA-mRNA paires to construct the miRNA-mRNA network, which included 107 miRNAs, 1476 mRNAs and 14678 interaction pairs. We observed a power-law distribution with a slope of    $-1.082$   and an    $R$  -squared value of 0.793. This signifyed that the network displayed scale-free characteristics typical of a biological network rather than a random network. To identify miRNA-mediated mRNA-mRNA interactions, we used a hyper geometric test to investigate the potential interaction between mRNA pairs. We deﬁned mRNA-mRNA competing pairs if they shared the same miRNA and had a    $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}$  -value    $<\,0.05$  . Then we obtained the RNLS, ALOX5AP, CD137, KALRN, and SOCS1 associated 3463 mRNA-mRNA pairs and constructed mRNA-mRNA interaction network ( Figure 3A ). We calculated three topological properties of the mRNA-mRNA network: the node degree, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. Then, we ranked the topological features of all nodes and found that KALRN and CD137 were common nodes that were present in the top ﬁve of each index described above ( Table 3 ). To explore the potential functional implications of KALRN and CD137, we performed functional enrichment analysis of GO for the mRNAs in the network ( Figure 3B ). These genes were enriched to the in amma tion relevant terms: such as T cell activation, regulation of cell-cell adhesion, regulation of lymphocyte activation and so on.  

# DISCUSSION  

IS is result of a reduction of blood ﬂow and oxygen to the brain, due to occlusion the cerebral artery by embolus or a thrombus produces ( Musuka et al., 2015 ;  Hankey, 2017 ). The ident i cation of genes and molecules that are related to IS occurrence is important for our understanding and control of the disease. With a substantial genetic component, the heritability of IS ranges from 16 to   $40\%$  ( Bevan et al., 2012 ), GWAS and several case-control association studies revealed the contributory role of several variants belonging to diﬀerent genes on IS and their speciﬁc subtypes, such as protein kinase C eta (PRKCH), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 4 (TIMD4), cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor

 (CDKN) and ara chi donate 5-lip oxygen as e activating protein

 (ALOX5AP) ( Wu et al., 2009 ;  Traylor et al., 2012 ;  Larsson et al., 2017 ;  Liu et al., 2017 ;  Kho un phi nith et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, such association study is unable to explain the biological complexity of IS, which a multi factorial disease with a number of components being involved in its pathological mechanism, including numerous environmental and genetic risk factors. In this study, a multidimensional network was constructed to provide new insights on the mechanism underlying the progression of IS.  

Although the relationships among gene, risk factors and IS have been extensively investigated, there is lack of a united gene-risk factors-IS model to account for the modulation of SNP on the contribution of IS. In this study, we used mediation analysis to investigate gene-risk factors-IS pathways

to explain how SNP selected in this article polymorphism aﬀects Is and IS subtypes via modulating the risk factors. In rs161818-systolic BP-at hero thrombosis subtype of IS and rs161827-systolic BP-at hero thrombosis subtype of IS pathways, the rs161818 and rs161827 has an eﬀect on at hero thrombosis subtype of IS directly, and also aﬀect at hero thrombosis subtype of IS through the mediating eﬀect of systolic BP. And then, in other pathways of the study, SNP aﬀect IS or IS subtypes through the mediating eﬀect of risk factors. For instance, mediation analysis revealed that the blood pressure mediated the association between rs161818 (CD137), rs161810 (CD137), rs161827 (CD137) and IS/at hero thrombosis subtype of IS; between rs161818 (CD137), rs161810 (CD137), rs33932899 (SOCS1) and lacunar IS subtype; between rs161818 (CD137), rs161810 (CD137), rs161827 (CD137), rs4073259 (ALOX5AP) and combination subtype of IS. And interestingly, the HDL mediated the eﬀect of rs4073259 polymorphisms not only on IS, but on all IS subtypes in this study. The blood glucose mediated the eﬀect of rs10887800 (RNLS), rs11712619 (KALRN) on at hero thrombosis subtype of IS/combination subtype of IS. Concurrently, the blood glucose mediated the eﬀect of rs17286604 (KALRN) on combination subtype of IS also. And then according to the MDR analysis, our ﬁndings revealed signiﬁcant interactions between rs161818 (CD137), rs10887800 (RNLS) and rs4073259 (ALOX5AP) in the aﬀection of outcome, increasing the risk of IS and lacunar IS subtype. For at hero thrombosis subtype of IS, the signiﬁcant interactions between rs161818 (CD137), rs243327 (SOCS1), rs10887800 (RNLS) were observed in the degree of risk. Another interaction model we found among rs161818 (CD137), rs2576178 (RNLS) and rs7620580 (KALRN) that increased the combination subtype of IS risk.  

Hypertension is widely recognized as the most important modiﬁable risk factor for all types of stroke, the incidence of stroke increases proportionally with both systolic and diastolic pressure, increasing the relative risk 3.1-fold for men and 2.9-fold for women ( Kannel et al., 1981 ;  Cipolla et al., 2018 ). Hypertension acts in stroke through various mechanisms, such as aﬀecting vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), endo the li al dysfunction, oxidative stress, changes in cerebral blood ﬂow, and in amma tion ( Shekhar et al., 2017 ;  Shekhar et al., 2018 ). In the current investigation, we used a mediation model and revealed that the blood pressure might mediate the modulation of SOCS1 and CD137 polymorphism on the IS. This gene-blood pressure-IS pathway may help us to better understand the IS mechanism. The systolic BP mediated the eﬀect of rs161818 (CD137), rs161810 (CD137) and rs161827 (CD137) polymorphisms on the IS and at hero thrombosis subtype of IS. Diastole BP mediated the eﬀect of rs161818 (CD137) and rs161810 (CD137) polymorphisms on the IS. The diastole BP mediated the eﬀect of rs161818 (CD137), rs161810 (CD137) and rs161827 (CD137) on the at hero thrombosis subtype of IS. The systolic BP mediated the eﬀect of rs161818 (CD137), rs161810 (CD137) and rs33932899 (SOCS1) on lacunar IS subtype. SOCS1 is expressed by immune cells, SOCS1 protein modulated in amma tory signaling ( Metcalf et al., 2002 ;  Davey et al., 2006 ), and it has been shown to be associated with hypertension via the JAK-STAT pathway ( Ortiz-Munoz et al., 2010 ;  Satou et al., 2012 ). CD137 is a member of TNF receptor superfamily, expressed primarily on activated T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, resting monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), CD137L as the ligand for CD137 is mainly expressed on DCs, B cells and macrophages ( Watts, 2005 ;  Shao and Schwarz, 2011 ). Recent studies suggest that CD137/CD137L interactions may activate NF $\kappa\mathrm{B}$   to secrete and elevate transcription for IL6 and tumor necrosis factor  α  (TNF α ), are critical for initiating and modulating antitumor immune responses ( Kim et al., 2011 ). Increasing evidence have suggested that immune cells, such as TNF $\upalpha$   and IL-6, plays an important role in the blood pressure modulation, particularly in angiotensin II induced hypertension ( Lee et al., 2006 ;  Harrison et al., 2010 ; Harrison et al., 2011 ). Our ﬁndings also suggest that BP mediated the eﬀect of SOCS1 and CD137 SNP on IS and at hero thrombosis, lacunar IS subtype. The two genes may through an in amma tory mechanism interact with BP that is indirectly associated with IS.  

Lipoprotein is widely recognized as the most important correlated factor for IS ( Fuentes et al., 2009 ;  Lapergue et al., 2010 ). In previous studies, the results from the investigations of the relationship between high levels of lipoprotein and IS are conﬂicting ( Amarenco et al., 2008 ;  Chei et al., 2013 ). This may be because lipoprotein is involved in the occurrence of IS through some mechanisms rather than directly in the path o physiological process of IS. In the present study, a mediation model of gene-lipoprotein-IS pathway were measured. Interestingly, HDL mediated the eﬀect of rs4073259 not only on IS, but on IS all subtypes in this study. ALOX5AP with 5-lip oxygen as e (5-LO) is required for leu kotri ene synthesis, previous research also showed that ALOX5AP regulated the oxLDL-induced in amma tion ( Silva et al., 2009 ). HDL plays an anti-in amma tory role maybe involved in TNF $\upalpha$  -induced adhesion and NF $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$   pathway ( Zhu and Parks, 2012 ). The results from our data, HDL might mediate the in amma tory response that involved in IS and IS subtypes.  

Hyperglycemia is common in patients with IS and is associated with worse outcomes ( Zheng and Zhao, 2020 ). It is also well known that severe or long-term hypoglycemia can result in permanent brain damage. In our study, the glucose mediated the eﬀect of rs10887800 (RNLS) and rs11712619 (KALRN) on the at hero thrombosis subtype of IS and combination subtype of IS. In addition, the glucose mediated the eﬀect of rs17286604 (KALRN) on combination subtype of IS. RNLS is a monoamine oxidase secreted by kidney and involved in the oxidative degradation of circulating cate chola mines. Several RNLS SNPs have been linked to common human diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes. From literature suggest, RNLS involved in blood pressure regulation and endo the li al dysfunction ( Zbroch et al., 2012 ). KALRN genetic variations may lead to endo the li al dysfunction and atherosclerosis through inﬂuence on the Rac-1 signaling pathway, which is associated with Type 2 diabetic( Mofarrah et al., 2016 ).  

SNP-based approaches for identifying interaction may have no marginal eﬀects to the trait but have strong interaction eﬀects with other SNP ( He and Lin, 2011 ). Furthermore, these approaches have limitations and cannot fully interpret in a viewpoint of SNP interactions ( Li et al., 2015 ). SNPSNP interaction analysis provide new insights into the genetic bases of complex diseases, and as an important way can portray the non-linear i ties in the relationship between genotype combinations and trait ( Fang and Chiu, 2012 ;  Ma et al., 2013 ). To fully understand the impact of the SNP-SNP crosstalk on IS, we used the MDR analysis by a classical casecontrol approach. The analysis showed that CD137, RNLS, and ALOX5AP sign i cant ly increased risk of IS and lacunar IS subtype. Besides, CD137, SOCS1, and RNLS were observed increased the degree of risk in at hero thrombosis subtype of IS, and CD137, RNLS, and KALRN increased the combination subtype of IS risk. To explore the biological impact in IS of the RNLS, ALOX5AP, CD137, KALRN, and SOCS1, we performed GO enrichment analysis for the genes and found the enriched terms related genes. Then we used mRNAmiRNA interaction data predicted by the miRanda to construct a mRNA-miRNA network. Based on miRNA sponge, we next obtained the mRNA-mRNA interaction pairs using the hyper geometric test. GO enrichment analysis for the neighbor genes of RNLS, ALOX5AP, CD137, KALRN, and SOCS1 showed that those genes are involved T cell activation, regulation of cell-cell adhesion, regulation of lymphocyte activation. These biological processes are associated with the in amma tion. As previously reports described, in amma tion plays a major role in IS path o mechanism. Topological analysis of the mRNAmRNA network, we found that CD137 and KALRN were common nodes in the top ﬁve of each index. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that CD137 and KALRN to regulate in amma tory mechanism during the pathogen es is and progression of IS.  

In conclusion, this study opens a new avenue to evaluate underlying mechanisms and biomarkers of IS through integrating multiple omics data. We identiﬁed a gene-risk factors-IS/IS subtypes pathway to explain how the SNP in this study aﬀects IS and IS subtypes. Furthermore, our study provide IS risk modules of SNPs, and related biological processes on transcript ome level. Obviously, future studies are needed to understand the underlying biological mechanism in gene-risk factors-IS/IS subtypes and the association between SNP-SNP interactions on IS/IS subtypes.
