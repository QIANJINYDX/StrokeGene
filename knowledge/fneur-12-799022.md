Chai J, Cao X-L and Lu F (2022) Association of Interleukin-6–174G/C Polymorphism With Ischemic Stroke: An Updated Meta-Analysis. Front. Neurol. 12:799022. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2021.799022 Background:  Although numerous epidemiological studies have investigated the association between  − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphism in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene-sti mula tory region and the risk of ischemic stroke (IS), they failed to reach a uniﬁed conclusion. The true relationship between  − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphism and IS remains controversial and unclear. Therefore, in this meta-analysis, we aimed to analyze more precisely the association between  − 174G/C(rs1800795) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of IL-6 gene and IS in a larger pooled population.  

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in  PubMed, Web of Science,  and  the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  until June 30, 2021. A ﬁxed or random-effects model was utilized based on heterogeneity between studies. The odds ratios (ORs) and  $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals (Cis) were calculated in the models of allele comparison (  $\textcircled{\scriptsize{2}}$   vs. C), homozygote comparison (GG vs. CC) and (GC vs. CC), dominant (GG vs.   $\mathsf{G C}+\mathsf{C C})$  , hyper dominant   $(\mathsf{G G}+\mathsf{C C}$   vs. GC), and recessive (  $^{(\mathrm{LG}+}$  GC vs. CC) to determine the strength of associations.  

Results:  This meta-analysis included 13 case-control studies in 35 articles with 5,548 individuals. Overall, no signiﬁcant associations between   $\mathsf{I L\!-\!6-\!174G/C(r s1800795)}$   and IS were identiﬁed (G vs. C:OR   $[95\%\bigcirc]=0.99$   [0.81, 1.21],  $P=0.91$  ;  $\mathsf{G G}+\mathsf{C C}$   vs. GC:0.97 [0.85, 1.11],  $P=0.66$  ; GG vs.   $\mathsf{G C}+\mathsf{C C}$  : 1.01 [0.81, 1.25],  $P=0.94$  ; GC vs. CC: OR   $[95\%~\mathsf{C}]=1.01$   [0.68, 1.5],    $P=0.96$  ; GG vs. CC:0.93 [0.57, 1.51],  $P$   $=0.76$  ;   $\mathsf{G G}+\mathsf{G C}$   vs. CC:0.97 [0.64, 1.47],  $P=0.89,$  ). In the subgroup analyses by ethnicity or HWE  $P_{\cdot}$  -value, there was a statistically signiﬁcant association between IL-6

  $-174\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{C}$  (rs1800795) polymorphisms and IS in the alleles model; (G vs. C: LogOR   $[95\%$   $\mathsf{C}|]=0.14$   [ − 0.16,.45],  $P=0.00,$  ), homozygote model (GG vs. CC: LogOR   $\left.[95\%\;\mathsf{C}\right|]=$  0.18 [ − 0.58,.95],  $P=0.00,$  ) and (GC vs. CC: LogOR   $[95\%~\mathsf{C}]=0.2$   [ − 0.46,.85],  $P=$  0.00), dominant model (GG vs.   $\mathsf{G C}+\mathsf{C C}$  : OR   $[95\%\,\mathsf{C}]=0.02$   [ − 0.72, 0.77],  $P=0.00,$  ), and recessive model   $(\mathsf{G G}+\mathsf{G C}$   vs. CC: OR   $\left[95\%\,\mathsf{C l}\right]\!\!=-0.17$  [ − 0.86,.52],  $P=0.00)$   of the European population and in the dominant model (GG vs.   $\mathsf{G C}+\mathsf{C C}$  : OR   $\left[95\%\subset\right]=$   $-0.13\left[-0.51\,,\,0.24\right])$   of the Asian population. No statistical sign i can ce was identiﬁed in both six models of HWE  $p\geq0.2$   group (both  $P\ge0.05)$  ).  

Conclusion: This meta-analysis revealed no correlation between IL-6 − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphism and IS, whereas the subgroup analysis indicated that the relationship between IL-6  − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphism and IS susceptibility varied sign i cant ly according to ethnicity and geography.

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is characterized by high rates of morbidity, mortality, recurrence, and disability. Examples of strokes include ischemic strokes (IS) and hemorrhagic strokes (HS). IS accounts for 70-  $90\%$   of the incidence of strokes ( 1 ). It can cause irreversible neuronal damage in the ischemic area within a few minutes ( 2 ). Furthermore, studies indicated that IS is also the second leading cause of preventable deaths and the third leading cause of long-term disability among adults worldwide ( 3 ).  

The pathogen es is of ischemic stroke (IS) is complex and unclear. In amma tory factors have been demonstrated to play a fundamental role in the physiology, etiology, and pathology of IS and other brain injury forms ( 4 ). Moreover, studies have indicated that in amma tion is critical in atherosclerosis occurrence and development, which is common across several IS subtypes when classiﬁed according to schemes such as Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment. It has also been demonstrated to be linked to an increased susceptibility to stroke and coronary heart disease ( 4 ,  5 ). Not only does in amma tion play an important role in IS development caused by atherosclerosis, but Kelly et al. also reported that in amma tion could inﬂuence diﬀerent pathogenic subtypes of IS by contributing to a pro thr ombo tic status regardless of the stroke subtype ( 5 ,  6 ). Moreover, embolic strokes of undetermined sources (ESUS) account for one-third of IS. Acampa et al. found that the relationship between AF and ESUS may be mediated by in amma tion rather than a simple cause-and-eﬀect mechanism ( 6 ). Likewise, they stated that the increased risk of AF in a crypto geni c stroke might be due to in amma tion-mediated atrial remodeling and electrical remodeling ( 7 ). These studies reveal that in amma tion plays an important pathological role in diﬀerent IS types, especially in crypto geni c strokes in amma tion that can also promote atrial car dio path y, which is a potential new pathogen.  

The brain’s response to ischemic injury can be regarded as an acute and long-term in amma tory process, characterized by rapid polarization of microglia, production of pro-in amma tory cytokines, and presentation of various leukocyte types into ischemic brain tissue, leading to IS occurrence and development ( 8 ). This was conﬁrmed by increased concentrations in proin amma tory cytokines in the blood, cerebrospinal ﬂuid in patients, and by studies of animal-induced experiments ( 9 ). Therefore, many studies focused on the role of pro-in amma tory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor $\upalpha$   (TNF $\cdot\mathfrak{Q}.$  ), interleukin1 (IL-1), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in IS pathogen es is. These studies found that genes, which are cytokines with anti-in amma tory properties, may contribute to IS occurrence and development ( 9 – 11 ).  

Therefore, functional polymorphisms of in amma tory genes may inﬂuence IS incidence and outcome. The contribution of IL-6 genetic polymorphism to the change in IS IL-6 levels was also reported ( 12 ). A part of SNPs identiﬁed in the IL6 gene has a substantial impact on gene expression that can alter plasma levels of IL-6. For instance, the promoter variant (G-572C) can inﬂuence the transcription eﬃciency of IL-6, which may play a role in in amma tion-related diseases such as IS. Nevertheless, researchers found that  − 174G/C(rs1800795) SNP in the promoter region of IL-6 gene did not contribute to the increase of IL-6 level in plasma ( 12 ,  13 ). Many studies investigated the potential association between IL-6 − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphism and IS. However, these ﬁndings are inconsistent, and the sample size of individual studies is statistically insuﬃcient. Therefore, the relationship between SNP  − 174G/C(rs1800795) in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene and IS remains controversial and unclear.  

In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to better evaluate the relationship between IL-6  − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphism and IS in a larger clustered population.  

# METHODS  

# Search Strategy  

We searched  PubMed, Web of Science,  and  the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  databases for papers associating IL6  − 174G/C polymorphism and IS available by June 30, 2021, without language restrictions using the following search terms:  

(“Ischemic Stroke” OR “Ischemic Strokes” OR “Stroke, Ischemic” OR “Ischaemic Stroke” OR “Ischaemic Strokes” OR “Stroke, Ischaemic” OR “Crypto geni c Ischemic Stroke” OR “Crypto geni c Ischemic Strokes” OR “Ischemic Stroke, Crypto geni c” OR “Stroke, Crypto geni c Ischemic” OR “Crypto geni c Stroke” OR “Crypto geni c Strokes” OR “Stroke, Crypto geni c” OR “Crypto geni c Embolism Stroke” OR “Crypto geni c Embolism Strokes” OR “Embolism Stroke, Crypto geni c” OR “Stroke, Crypto geni c Embolism” OR “Wake-up Stroke” OR “Stroke, Wake-up” OR “Wake up Stroke” OR “Wake-up Strokes” OR “Acute Ischemic Stroke” OR “Acute Ischemic Strokes” OR “Ischemic Stroke, Acute” OR “Stroke, Acute Ischemic”) AND (“Interleukin $\cdot6"$   OR

# Study Selection  

Citations selected from this initial search were screened and assessed for eligibility according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) case-control design, (2) investigation of the association of   $\mathrm{IL-6-174G/C}$   polymorphism and susceptibility to IS, (3) providing suﬃcient data about the genotype frequencies of IL-6 genetic polymorphisms for calculating the value of odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   CI, and (4) full-text articles. Studies were excluded if one of the following criteria was fulﬁlled: (1) unrelated to IL-6 polymorphisms or IS (2) included reviews/comments/letters, (3) included case reports or case series, and (4) lack reusable data. If duplicate reports by the same authors or the same group of patients were found, the team included only the most complete study for pooled analyses.  

# Data Extraction  

Following PRISMA guidance ( 14 ), the following data were extracted from each eligible study independently by two reviewers; (Jie Chai and Xian-Ling Cao): ﬁrst author name, publication year, study design, number of cases and controls, number of males and females, sample ethnicity, mean age of each group, allele frequencies, and genotype of IL-6 174G/C SNP gene polymorphisms in cases and controls. Discrepancies were

resolved by discussion to reach consensus and arbitrated by a third person (Feng Lu) when necessary.  

# Quality Assessment  

The quality of methods for included studies was independently assessed by two reviewers; (Jie Chai and Xian-Ling Cao) using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).  NOS uses a star rating system to assess quality and studies scores ranging from 0 to 9 stars ( 15 ,  16 ). Twelve of thirteen included studies had   $\mathrm{NOS}\,\geq\,7,$  demonstrating good method o logic quality and a low risk of bias. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by a consensus agreement or by consulting the senior author (Feng Lu).  

# Statistical Analysis  

The strength of the association between IL-6 − 174G/C(rs1800795) gene polymorphisms and IS risk was measured by ORs with   $95\%$   CIs for allele comparison (G vs. C), homozygote comparison (GG vs. CC) and (GC vs. CC), dominant (GG vs.   $\mathrm{GC+CC})$  ), hyper dominant   $(\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{CC}$   vs. GC), and recessive   $(\mathrm{GC\mathrm{~+~}G C}$   vs. CC) models. The deviation of HWE in the control group was tested by the goodness-of-ﬁt chi-square test. A    $P$  -value    $<\ 0.05$   was considered statistically signiﬁcant. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata (version 16). Statistical heterogeneity among studies was estimated using the  Q -test and   $\mathrm{I}^{2}$    statistics. Heterogeneity was acceptable as long as  $\mathrm{I}^{2}\,\le\,50\%$  . A random-eﬀects model was used to estimate the pooled log ORs and   $95\%$   CIs as heterogeneity reached a  $P<0.1$  or  $\mathrm{I}^{2}>5\bar{0\%}$  .  

# RESULTS  

# Literature Search  

Figure 1  displays the PRISMA ﬂow diagram of the detailed literature screening process. A total of 35 articles, including one duplicate record, were found after a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials. After carefully reviewing the abstracts of 34 non-duplicate studies, we excluded 11 studies as nine were review articles and two were cover letters. For the remaining 23 articles, ﬁve did not demonstrate eligible data, and one was excluded because it was not a case-control study ( 17 ). Two studies had overlapped data with duplication of cases and controls in Pola et al., Flex et al., Revilla et al., and Chamorro et al. ( 18 – 21 ). Two studies were about another disease. Finally, this metaanalysis included 13 eligible studies with an overall sample size ranging from 42 to 748 cases.

# Study Characteristics  

Table 1  summarizes the essential characteristics of studies included in our meta-analysis, including the author, region, publication year, case/control, age, genotyping, HWE    $P$  -value, and quality score. These studies, which were enrolled from 2003 to 2016, encompassed 2,654 cases and 2,894 controls. Regarding patient’s ethnicity, the 13 patients were from Italy (2), India (2), Australia (3), China (1), Ireland (1), Spain (1), Poland (1), Turkey (1), and Croatia (1). The study by Balcerzyk et al. ( 27 ) on IS in children revealed that the mean age of controls was    ${<}25$   years, excluding studies without reference to an average age. While  $P_{-}$  HWE   -value in the study by Tutto lomond o et al. was 0.001 ( 24 ).  

# Results of Meta-Analysis  

The results of meta-analysis are displayed in  Figure 2 ;  Table 2 . IL-6  − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphism has no correlation with IS susceptibility. OR and   $95\%$   CI for each model were as follows: G vs. C: 0.99 [0.81, 1.21];   $\mathrm{GGG}+\mathrm{CC}$   vs. GC: 0.97 [0.85,

 1.11]; GG vs.   $\mathrm{GC\+\CC}$  : 1.01 [0.81, 1.25]; GC vs. CC: 1.01

 [0.68, 1.5]; GG vs. CC:0.93 [0.57, 1.51];   $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{GC}$   vs. CC:0.97

 [0.64, 1.47].  

In subgroup analyses by ethnicity or HWE  $P$  - value, there was a statistically signiﬁcant association between IL-6

 − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphisms and IS in the allele model

 (G vs. C: 1.15 [0.85, 1.57]), homozygote model (GG vs. CC: 1.2

 [0.56, 2.58]) and (GC vs. CC: 1.22 [0.63, 2.35]), dominant model

 (GG vs.   $\mathrm{GC+CC:1.17}$   [0.83, 1.66]), and recessive model (GG

  $+\ \mathrm{GC}$  model (G vs. C: 1.08 [0.61, 1.9]), homozygote model (GG vs. CC: 0.92 [0.23, 3.71]) and (GC vs. CC: 0.77[0.22, 2.74]), dominant model (GG vs. GC    $+$   CC: 1.27 [0.72, 2.25]), and recessive model   $(\mathrm{GC\mathrm{~+~}G C}$   vs. CC: 0.82 [(0.22, 3.04]) of HWE    $P_{-}$  - value  $<0.2$  .  

Figure 3 illustrates Begg’s funnel plots estimating publication bias. The shape of funnel plots indicates signiﬁcant relevant publication bias ( Figure 3A ). Therefore, we use the non-parametric trim and ﬁll method to identify and correct the funnel asymmetry caused by publication bias ( Figure 3B ). The results show that OR value and   $95\%$   CI of the combined eﬀect calculated by the random eﬀect model is 0.99 [0.81, 1.21] after pruning, indicating that publication bias has an in sign i cant impact on our conclusion and that our conclusion is relatively reliable.  

# DISCUSSION  

In this study, 13 independent studies were evaluated with 5,548 individuals, including 2,654 cases and 2,894 controls. Overall, this meta-analysis showed that in a large population, no association exists between    $-174\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{C}(\mathrm{rs}1800795)$  and IS. Our results are consistent with Jin et al., but our number of studies is about twice that included in their survey after removing duplicate data. Moreover, we conducted a subgroup analysis on ethnicity and HWE values ( 25 ), demonstrating a signiﬁcant diﬀerence  

![](images/2a95d8167e772ed30a0d0c984cfcf239737e2a4149cbc1e5bd8f6bc7ebd98c3a.jpg)  

among diﬀerent populations, especially in the European population sample. Besides, the sub-group analysis of HWE indicated the same results. The risk of IS varies sign i cant ly by race and geography. IS is a major complication of at hero sclerotic cardiovascular disease and involves complex biological processes and interaction pathways of non-genetic and genetic factors, causing a fairly high mortality ( 22 ,  23 ).  

Given that animal and clinical trials demonstrated IS patients have elevated levels of pro-in amma tory cytokine IL-6, numerous studies were conducted to demonstrate the relationship between SNP − 174G/C(rs1800795) in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene and IS but with diﬀerent conclusions ( 21 , 26 , 28 , 29 ). Although SNP − 174G/C(rs1800795) is evidenced to be involved in IS path o physiology, there is little evidence to date that SNP − 174G/C(rs1800795) in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene is a risk factor. Banerjee et al. stated no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in IL-6  − 174G/C frequency between crude IS cases and controls in the Indian population sample ( 28 ). Meanwhile, Chakra bor ty et al. found that GC genotype is linked to increased mortality and a poorer outcome of the Indian population ( 30 ).  

Moreover, Tong et al. revealed that IL-6 polymorphism at  $-174$   is unlikely to sign i cant ly contribute to susceptibility or aﬀect IS progression in either Han or Uyghur populations ( 12 ). On the contrary, in a study of 114 patients with IS and 187 healthy controls, Bazina et al. found that IL $6~-174\mathrm{G/C}$   polymorphism can be employed as a candidate gene marker and risk factor for predicting the early onset of IS in the Croatian population sample ( 31 ). In contrast, Yan et al. revealed that the G allele of the IL-6 promoter 174  $\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{C}$   polymorphisms protects against stroke ( 13 ). Furthermore, Ozkan et al. demonstrated that IL-6 gene polymorphism is associated with IS, both homozygous and heterozygous conditions, in patients of the south Marmara region of Turkey ( 10 ). However, Lalouschek et al. and Balding et al. both found that IS incidence was not sign i cant ly correlated with IL-6 polymorphism ( 29 ,  32 ).  

This current study has a few limitations. First, we have included a study of IS in children. However, after excluding this study, the meta-analysis also showed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence. Second, we included a study in which HWE    $P~<$  0.05, but no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found after removing this study, and we conducted a subgroup meta-analysis. It should be noted that the small sample size of included studies may limit the general iz ability of our ﬁndings. Finally, another potential limitation is that our meta-analysis was performed at a study level, implying the reuse of data provided in papers. As a result, it is evident that there is a publication bias between the studies included. Although we used additional methods to prove that this impact is negligible, we cannot completely ignore the potential impact of publication bias on our research results.  

There is a high degree of heterogeneity in our metaanalysis. Using diﬀerent methods to assess the potential sources of heterogeneity indicates that heterogeneity can  

![](images/852b72a41b1b9e2d108745ab721e2082b92c319b5aa5f98926f3caca0c490998.jpg)

almost be explained by national and ethnic diﬀerences. After careful reading and summarizing the articles, we found that the possibility of clinical heterogeneity is small. Due to slight diﬀerences in gene detection technology, there may be methodological heterogeneity. These results may indicate that our heterogeneity is mainly attributed to statistical and methodological heterogeneity. Our research ﬁndings require careful consideration, and larger-scale experiments are required to verify these ﬁndings.  

In conclusion, although our study indicates that IL-6 − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphism does not correlate with IS susceptibility, the subgroup analysis revealed that IL-6 − 174G/C(rs1800795) polymorphism is linked to IS susceptibility in the European population sample. It also indirectly conﬁrms that there are racial diﬀerences in IS susceptibility. However, further studies using a larger sample from multiple centers may enhance our study results.
