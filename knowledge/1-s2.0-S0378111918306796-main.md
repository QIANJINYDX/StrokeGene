Background:  Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex and devastating vascular disease that has become one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Several studies have shown the association between matrix metal lo protein as e (MMP) family gene polymorphisms and IS. However, the results have been indecisive.  

Objective:  To investigate the association between Matrix Metal lo protein as e gene polymorphisms and risk of IS. Methods:  A literature search for eligible candidate gene studies published before, 28 June 2017, was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases. The following combinations of main keywords were used: ( ‘ Matrix Metal lo protein as e ’  or  ‘ MMP ’  or  ‘ Strom elys in-1 ’  or  ‘ Gelatinase b ’ ) AND ( ‘ ischemic stroke ’  or  ‘ IS ’ ) AND ( ‘ single nucleotide polymorphism ’  or  ‘ gene polymorphism ’  or  ‘ SNP ’ ). Fixed or random e ﬀ ects models were used to estimate the Pooled Odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval (CI). Statistical analysis was carried out by using STATA version 13.0 software.  

Results:  Total 29 studies were included in our meta-analysis. A signi ﬁ cant association was observed for MMP-9  $\left(-1562\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T}\right)$   (OR 1.27;  $95\%$   CI 1.06 to 1.53; p value   $=0.01$  ) and MMP-12 (  $\cdot\,-\,1082\,\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$   (OR 2.55;   $95\%$   CI 1.75 to 3.71; p value   $<0.001$  ) gene polymorphisms and risk of IS. No signi ﬁ cant association was found for any of the MMP-1( − 1607 1G/2G), MMP-2   $\mathit{\zeta}\mathit{-1306C/T)}$   &   $(-735\mathrm{C/T})$   and MMP-3   $\left(-1612\ 5\mathsf{A}/6\mathsf{A}\right)$  ) gene polymorphisms with the risk of IS.  

Conclusion:  Our meta-analysis suggests that MMP-9 ( − 1562C/T) and MMP-12   $\mathrm{\check{-}}1082\;\mathrm{\AA/G}$   gene polymorphisms could be a risk factor for IS while MMP-1 (  $\zeta\!-\!1607\ 1\!\mathrm{G}/2\mathrm{G}$  ), MMP-2   $(-1306\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{T})$   &   $(-735\mathrm{C/T})$   and MMP-3   $\dot{}-1612\,5\mathrm{A}/6\mathrm{A})$  ) have no association with the risk of causing IS. However, large prospective studies with su ﬃ cient power are required to validate our  ﬁ ndings.  

# 1. Introduction  

Ischemic Stroke (IS) a complex polygenic disease is known to be a major cause of adult disability and mortality worldwide. Cervical artery dissection, carotid artery sti ﬀ ness and internal carotid artery stenosis are known to be major risk factors for IS susceptibility ( Brandt et al., 2001 ;  Ghilardi et al., 2002 ;  Kalb, 2001 ;  Lin et al., 2012 ). Genetics may contribute up to   $50\%$   of an individual's risk of developing a stroke in future ( “ Welcome to the International Stroke Genetics Consortium/ International Stroke Genetics Consortium, ”  n.d. ). Several candidate genes are implicated in the pathogen es is of IS, one of which is Matrix metal lo protein as es (MMPs).  

MMPs are calcium-dependent zinc-containing endo pep tid as es that play a crucial role in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) of blood vessels. They are produced by endo the li al cells, neurons, microglia and astrocytes and play a key role in the physiological degradation of ECM during ang io genesis, tissue repair and tissue morphogenesis ( Freije et al., 2003 ). An increased activity of MMP has been shown to be associated with the progression and development of aortic diseases whereas a blockage in the MMP activity leads to reduced stroke susceptibility or cerebral damage after stroke ( Rosenberg et al., 2001 ). MMPs play a crucial role in the complex path o physiology of IS including hemorrhagic transformation of IS after thr ombo lysis ( Inzitari et al., 2013 ), development of sub clinical peri ventricular white matter disease (i.e. leuk oara ios is) ( Corbin et al., 2014 ), and at hero sclerotic plaque maturation, degradation and rupture ( Nikkari et al., 1995a ). Activation and increased expression of MMPs have been known to be involved in thr ombo lysis-mediated blood brain barrier (BBB) leakage, leading to risk of hemorrhagic stroke.  

MMPs play a key part in the process of atherosclerosis which has been indicated by the evidence generated by data from genetically engineered mice, expression studies on at hero sclerotic tissues and measurement of circulating markers. Causality cannot be proven by the evidence generated from these expression studies and circulating markers since the changes do not have a causal role and instead could be secondary to the disease process itself. Whereas, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are present since birth and are known to be associated with the changes in the MMP activity. Therefore, studying the SNPs could give an estimate of lifelong exposure and could help in obtaining further information on causality ( Abilleira et al., 2006 ).  

Several studies have been conducted in the past for depicting the association between various MMP gene polymorphisms and IS susce pti bil it y including the risk of internal carotid artery stenosis, cervical artery dissection and carotid artery sti ﬀ ness but the results have been inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of 29 studies for investigating the association between MMP-1 ( − 1607 1G/2G), MMP-2

 ( − 1306C/T) & ( − 735C/T), MMP-3 ( − 1612 5A/6A), MMP-9

 ( − 1562C/T) and MMP-12 (  $\cdot\,-1082\,\,\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$  ) gene polymorphisms and risk of IS.  

# 2. Materials & methods  

A literature search for eligible candidate gene studies published before, 28 June 2017, was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases. The following combinations of main keywords were used: ( ‘ Matrix Metal lo protein as e ’  or  ‘ MMP ’  or

 ‘ Strom elys in-1 ’  or  ‘ Gelatinase b ’ ) AND ( ‘ ischemic stroke ’  or  ‘ IS ’ ) AND

 ( ‘ single nucleotide polymorphism ’  or  ‘ gene polymorphism ’  or  ‘ SNP ’ ). The search was done without any language restriction however only the studies conducted on human adult subjects were selected. All references in eligible articles were extensively reviewed to identify additional published articles. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence intervals (CI) were determined for MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-12 gene-disease association by using a  ﬁ xed or random e ﬀ ects model. The meta-analysis was carried out by using STATA software, version 13.0 (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).  

# 2.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria  

Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they ful ﬁ lled all of the following inclusion criteria: (a) A case-control study investigating the association between MMP-1   $\left(-1607\;1\mathsf{G}/2\mathsf{G}\right)$   or MMP-2   $\left({-1306\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{T}}\right)$   or  $(-735\mathrm{C/T})$   or MMP-3   $\left(-1612\,\ 5\mathsf{A}/6\mathsf{A}\right)$   or MMP-9   $(-1562\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T})$   or MMP-12   $(-1082\mathrm{~}\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$   gene polymorphisms and risk of IS; (b) cases ful ﬁ lling the diagnostic criteria for IS in the published studies; (c) studies reporting su ﬃ cient genotype frequency data for calculating the Odds Ratio (OR) and corresponding   $95\%$   Con ﬁ dence Interval (CI). Studies were excluded if any of the following was present: (a) other than a case-control study; (b) duplicate records with overlapping subjects from the same study; (c) animal studies; (d) studies with insu ﬃ cient genotypic data. This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline ( Moher et al., 2009 ).

# 2.6. Data extraction  

According to the PRISMA guidelines, two investigators (S.M. and P.T.) independently reviewed each full text article for eligibility and extracted the following data from the eligible studies: surname of  ﬁ rst author, year of publication, country of origin, ethnicity, sample size of the study, mean age of cases and controls, male/female ratio, genotyping method, source of control etc. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion among all the authors and a consensus was reached.  

2.7. Quality assessment  

The methodological quality of each study included in our metaanalysis was assessed by using a modi ﬁ ed quality assessment scale designed for genetic association studies ( Attia et al., 2003 ). Both the traditional epidemiological considerations and genetic issues were taken into account by this scale. The scores on the scale ranged from 0 (worst) to 17 (best). Details regarding the scale and its scoring system is illustrated in  Table 1 . The quality assessment was conducted independent ly by two authors (S.M. and P.T.) and any inconsistency over the quality scores was resolved by discussion among all the authors.  

# 2.8. Statistical analysis  

Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested for genotype distributions in the controls for all the MMP gene polymorphisms by using the chi-square test. OR and corresponding   $95\%$   CI were calculated to determine the association between MMP-1   $\textup{(}-1607\ 1\textup{G}/2\textup{G})$  , MMP-2

  $(-1306\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T})$  & ( − 735C/T), MMP-3 ( − 1612 5A/6A), MMP-9

 ( − 1562C/T) and MMP-12   $(-1082\:\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$   gene polymorphisms and risk of IS under two genetic models, namely, dominant and recessive models. Cochran's Q statistic and   $\operatorname{I}^{2}\!\!\!\phantom{\operatorname{I}}$  metric tests were conducted for estimating the heterogeneity between the studies. A  ﬁ xed-e ﬀ ect model was used when   $\mathrm{I}^{2}$    value was   $<50\%$  ; while a random-e ﬀ ect model was applied when  $\mathrm{I}^{2}$    value   $>50\%$  . A strati ﬁ ed analysis based on ethnicity was also conducted to investigate the presence of overall association in the sub-groups. Publication bias in the studies was assessed by using Begg's funnel plot. Meta-regression analysis was also performed to test the association between methodological quality and the size of observed e ﬀ ect. Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was performed to adjust the  $p$  -values in the meta-analysis to control the false discovery rate ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ).  

# 3. Results  

The comprehensive literature search identi ﬁ ed 179 articles.  Fig. 1 depicts the study  ﬂ ow diagram. Out of 179 studies, 137 were excluded as they were either animal studies, duplicate records, reviews or were not associated with IS. Finally, a total of 29 case-control studies were

found eligible and were included in our meta-analysis. The publication years of the studies ranged from 2003 to 2017. Eleven studies were in Caucasian population while 18 studies were conducted in Asian population. Out of these 18 Asian studies, only one was conducted in Indian population while the rest 17 studies were all conducted in Chinese population. Twenty-six studies in this meta-analysis followed the HWE. The quality score of all the studies was found to be moderately high. Seventeen studies used hospital-based source of control, two studies used population-based source of control, one study used healthy volunteers as their source of control and nine studies did not report their source of control. A summary of the characteristics of all the included studies is represented in  Table 2 .  

# 3.1. Association between MMP-1 ( − 1607 1G/2G) gene polymorphism and risk of IS  

Five case-control studies with a total of 1425 cases and 1323 controls found no signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-1   $\left(-1607\ 1\mathrm{G}/2\mathrm{G}\right)$  gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model [2G/  $2\mathsf{G}\,+\,1\mathsf{G}/2\mathsf{G}$   vs 1G/1G: OR 1.24;   $95\%$   CI 0.82 to 1.89; p value  $=0.31.$  and recessive model [2G/2G vs  $1\mathsf{G}/1\mathsf{G}\,+\,1\mathsf{G}/2\mathsf{G}$  : OR 1.13;  $95\%$   CI 0.94 to 1.35; p value   $=0.19]$  . However, the 2G allele of MMP-1   $(-1607\,16/$  2G) was found to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with the risk of IS under allelic model [2G vs 1G: OR 1.25;  $95\%\mathrm{CI}\,1.00$   to 1.55; p value   $=0.049]$  ( Fig. 2 a). The shape of Begg's funnel plot suggested the presence of no signi ﬁ cant publication bias ( Fig. 3 ).  

# 3.2. Association between MMP-2 ( − 1306C/T) & ( − 735C/T) gene polymorphisms and risk of IS  

Four case-control studies with a total of 906 cases and 1050 controls found no signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-2 (  $\mathit{\zeta}\,-1306C/\mathrm{T})$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model   $[\mathrm{CT+TT}$   vs CC: OR 1.03;  $95\%$   CI 0.64 to 1.66; p value   $=0.89_{\cdot}^{\cdot}$  ], recessive model [TT vs  $\mathsf{C C}+\mathsf{C T}$  : OR 0.88;   $95\%$   CI 0.63 to 1.23; p value  $=0.45]$   and allelic model [T vs C: OR 1.25;  $95\%{\sf C I}\;0.73$   to 2.13; p value   $=0.425.$  ] ( Fig. 2 b). The shape of Begg's funnel plot suggested the presence of no signi ﬁ cant publication bias ( Fig. 3 ).  

Two case-control studies with a total of 491 cases and 520 controls found no signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-2   $(-735\mathrm{C/T})$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model   $[\mathrm{CT+TT}$   vs CC: OR 0.94;  $95\%$   CI 0.37 to 2.39; p value   $=0.90]$  , recessive model [TT vs  $\mathsf{C C}+\mathsf{C T}$  : OR 1.33;   $95\%$   CI 0.30 to 5.84; p value  $=0.71{}^{\circ}$  ] and allelic model [T vs C: OR 2.88;   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$   0.94 to 8.88; p value  $=0.0.065]$

3.3. Association between MMP-3 ( − 1612 5A/6A) gene polymorphism and risk of IS  

Ten studies with a total of 2469 cases and 2383 controls found no signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-3   $\langle-1612\,\,\,5\mathrm{A}/6\mathrm{A}\rangle$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model   $[6\mathrm{A}6\mathrm{A}+6\mathrm{A}5\mathrm{A}$   vs 5A5A: OR 1.02;   $95\%$   CI 0.77 to 1.35; p value   $=0.89]$  , recessive model [6A6A vs  $5\mathrm{A}5\mathrm{A}+$   6A5A: OR 0.94;   $95\%$   CI 0.82 to 1.08; p value  $=0.38]$  and allelic model [6A vs 5A: OR 0.91;   $95\%$   CI 0.79 to 1.06; p value  $=0.24]$  ] ( Fig. 2 d). The shape of Begg's funnel plot suggested the presence of no signi ﬁ cant publication bias ( Fig. 3 ).  

In the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, six Asian studies with a total of 1806 cases and 1690 controls found no signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-3   $\left(-1612\,\,5\mathsf{A}/6\mathsf{A}\right)$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model (OR 1.07;  $95\%$   CI 0.87 to 1.32; p value   $=0.493$  ), recessive model (OR 0.85;   $95\%$   CI 0.71 to 1.01; p value   $=0.07.$  ) and allelic model (OR 0.91;   $95\%\mathrm{CI}~0.73$   to 1.15;   $\mathtt{p}$   value  $=0.43)$  . Four Caucasian studies with a total of 663 cases and 693 controls also found no association between MMP-3   $\left(-1612\ 5\mathsf{A}/6\mathsf{A}\right)$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model (OR 1.07;   $95\%$   CI 0.52 to 2.21; p value  $=0.85.$  ), recessive model (OR 1.11;   $95\%$   CI 0.88 to 1.40; p value  $=0.36)$   and allelic model (OR 0.91;   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$   0.74 to 1.11; p value  $=0.38$  ).  

# 3.4. Association between MMP-9 ( − 1562C/T) gene polymorphism and risk of IS  

Seventeen studies with a total of 3741 cases and 3648 controls found a signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-9   $(-1562\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T})$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model   $[\mathrm{TT}+\mathrm{CT}$   vs CC: OR 1.27;  $95\%$   CI 1.06 to 1.53; p value   $=0.01]$  ], recessive model [TT vs  $\mathrm{CC+}$   CT: OR 2.43;   $95\%$   CI 1.85 to 3.19; p value   $<0.001.$  ] and allelic model [T vs C: OR 1.30;   $95\%$   CI 1.08 to 1.56; p value   $=0.005]$  ( Fig. 2 e). The shape of Begg's funnel plot suggested the presence of no signi ﬁ cant publication bias ( Fig. 3 ).  

In the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, 12 Asian studies with a total of 2818 cases and 2632 controls found a signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-9   $(-1562\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T})$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model (OR 1.37;   $95\%$   CI 1.15 to 1.62; p value   $=0.0003.$  ), recessive model (OR 2.53;   $95\%$   CI 1.86 to 3.45; p value   $<\,0.001)$  ) and allelic model (OR 1.41;   $95\%$   CI 1.16 to 1.71; p value   $=0.001$  ). Five Caucasian studies with a total of 923 cases and 1016 controls found no association between MMP-9   $\left(-1562\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T}\right)$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model (OR 1.03;   $95\%$   CI 0.61 to 1.73; p value  $=0.92$  ) and allelic model (OR 1.04;   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$   0.68 to 1.61; p value  $=0.84$  ) but a signi ﬁ cant association was observed under the recessive model (OR 2.06;  $95\%$   CI 1.14 to 3.73; p value   $=0.02$  ).  

3.5. Association between MMP-12 ( − 1082 A/G) gene polymorphisms and risk of IS  

Two case-control studies with a total of 266 cases and 279 controls found a signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-12   $(-1082\mathrm{~}\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS under dominant model   $[\mathsf{A G}+\mathsf{G G}$   vs AA: OR 2.55;   $95\%$   CI 1.75 to 3.71; p value   $<\,0.001]$   ( Fig. 2 f). The shape of Begg's funnel plot suggested the presence of no signi ﬁ cant publication bias ( Fig. 3 ).

# 3.7. Sensitivity analysis  

Sensitivity analysis was performed for all the MMP gene polymorphisms by sequentially omitting a single study in each turn. We observed that the pooled OR and   $95\%$   CI were not signi ﬁ cantly modi ﬁ ed in any of the MMP gene polymorphisms.  Fig. 5  depicts the sensitivity analysis carried out for the MMP-9 ( − 1562C/T) gene polymorphism.

from the original results was observed after controlling the FDR except in the recessive model of MMP-9 ( – 1562C/T) in the Caucasian population and allelic model of MMP-1   $\left(-1607\ 1\mathrm{G}/2\mathrm{G}\right)$  . After controlling for the FDR,  ﬁ ve Caucasian studies with a total of 923 cases and 1016 controls were found to have borderline signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-9   $(-1562\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T})$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS in the recessive model with an adjusted B-H p-value of 0.056. The signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-1   $\zeta\!-\!1607\,1\!G/2\!G)$   gene polymorphism and risk of IS in the allelic model was lost after controlling the FDR with an adjusted B-H p-value of 0.15.  Table 3  represents the B-H procedure and adjusted  $p$  -values for controlling the FDR in our meta-analysis.  

# 4. Discussion  

Our present meta-analysis suggests that MMP-9 (-1562C/T) and MMP-12   $(-1082\mathrm{~}\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$  ) might increase the risk of IS whereas MMP-1 ( − 1607 1G/2G), MMP-2 ( − 1306C/T) & ( − 735C/T) and MMP-3  $(-1612\,5{\mathrm{A}}/{6\mathrm{A}})$   gene polymorphisms have no e ﬀ ect in causing the risk of IS. After conducting the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the MMP-9 ( – 1562C/T) gene polymorphism was found to be a risk factor for Asian population in all the three models of inheritance.  

Several meta-analyses have been conducted till now to elucidate the association between MMP-9 ( – 1562C/T) gene polymorphism and the risk of IS with contradictory results and have been summarized in Table 4 . All these meta-analyses have been conducted in China having mostly Chinese studies included in their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest meta-analysis of 29 studies (including both Asian and Caucasian) conducted till now to determine the association between MMP family gene polymorphisms and risk of IS.  

MMPs are classi ﬁ ed according to their substrate speci ﬁ city and structural similarity and are mainly divided into  ﬁ ve classes: collagenases (MMP-1, -8, and -13), gelatin as es (MMP-2 and -9), stromelysins (MMP-3, -10, and -11), metal loe last as es, membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMP, MMP-14, -15, -16, -17, -24, and -25), and others (MMP-7,

In the adult brain the MMP expression has been found to be very low to undetectable. However, various MMPs are up regulated and activated after IS as suggested by clinical and experimental studies ( Lee et al., 2007 ;  McColl et al., 2008 ). Tissue inhibitor of metal lo protein as es (TIMPs), a group of endogenous proteins are responsible for regulating the activity of MMP by binding to the active and alternative site of activated MMP ( Malemud, 2006 ). Till date four homologous TIMPs (TIMPcs 1 to 4) have been identi ﬁ ed. MMP-1 and MMP-8 have been known to be up regulated in the infarcted tissue as compared to healthy controls in the human brain; however, the role of other MMPs in stroke is not yet well established ( Cuadrado et al., 2009 ).  

MMP-1 (collagen as e-1), a   $53\,\mathrm{kDa}$   protein is one of the most abundant proteases in the MMP family known for degrading types I, II and III interstitial collagens, is associated with the mechanism behind atherosclerotic stroke ( Manka et al., 2012 ;  Nikkari et al., 1995b ) and is known to be up regulated in the infarcted tissue. The 2G allele of   $(-1607~16/$  2G) polymorphism of MMP-1 increases the transcriptional activity by creating an E26 transcription factor binding site ( Rutter et al., 1998 ).  

The clinical role of MMP-1 (1607 1G/2G) gene polymorphism is poorly understood till date. The role of    $-1607\;1\mathsf{G}/2\mathsf{G}$   polymorphism of MMP1 has been elucidated by a meta-analysis of three studies published by Wen et al. (2014)  which observed a signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-1   $\left(-1607\;1\mathsf{G}/2\mathsf{G}\right)$   polymorphism and the risk of IS. However, the results of our meta-analysis are contradictory to the  ﬁ ndings of the previous meta-analysis. We found no association between MMP-1  $\left(-1607\ 1\mathsf{G}/2\mathsf{G}\right)$   gene polymorphism and the risk of IS in  ﬁ ve studies. The previous meta-analysis used a  ﬁ xed e ﬀ ects model and did not account for the signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity (I- square:   $81.4\%)$  ) present between the studies. This signi ﬁ cant association could have been lost if a random e ﬀ ects model was used for conducting the analysis.  

MMP-2 (gelatinase-A), a   $72\,\mathrm{kDa}$   protein is known to disrupt the blood brain barrier and leads to hemorrhagic transformation. MMP-2 contributes to infarction and hemorrhage volume and its activity increases in the later phases of IS indicating a neuro protective role within the ischemic core ( ). The MMP-2   $(-1306\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{T})$   gene polymorphism results in a lower MMP expression and enzymatic activity ( Price et al., 2001 ) whereas the C allele of    $-735$   promoter results

in a high transcriptional activity of MMP-2 ( Nie et al., 2014 ). The increased level of MMP-2 in the acute phase after IS has been attributed to improved clinical outcome ( Lucivero et al., 2007 ). In our meta-analysis, both the MMP-2 ( − 1306C/T) & ( − 735C/T) were not found to be associated with the risk of IS. Three studies published previously also observed no signi ﬁ cant association between these gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to IS. Only a single study published last year by Zhang et al. (2016)  found a signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-2

MMP-3 (strom elys in-1), a 51 kDa protein is known to degrade major extracellular matrix components including type I, III, IV, V, IX & X collagens, denatured collagens, laminin,  ﬁ bronectin and cartilage proteoglycans ( Klein and Bischo ﬀ , 2011b ;  Rosenberg, 2002 ). The role of MMP-3 in carotid atherosclerosis has been well established ( Henney et al., 1991 ) and an increase in the expression of MMP-3 has been linked with an increased ischemic brain injury ( Jian Liu and Rosenberg, 2005 ). MMP-3 polymorphisms have been known to be associated with the incidence of IS. The ( − 1612 5A/6A) gene polymorphism of MMP-3 is known to regulate the transcriptional activity of MMP-3 ( Rauramaa et al., 2000 ;  Ye et al., 1995 ). No study has observed any association between MMP-3   $\left(-1612\;\;5\mathsf{A}/6\mathsf{A}\right)$   gene polymorphism and clinical outcome after IS. As per the  ﬁ ndings of our meta-analysis, the MMP-3  $(-1612\ 5{\mathrm{A}}/6{\mathrm{A}})$   gene polymorphism was not found to be a risk factor for IS neither in the Asian nor in the Caucasian population. The results of our meta-analysis were in concordance with the previously published meta-analysis by  Wen et al. (2014)  which also found no association between MMP-3 ( − 1612 5A/6A) and risk of IS in eight studies. However, Wen D et al. concluded that the 6A allele of MMP-3 was a risk factor for IS, but their results clearly suggest otherwise (Dominant

The signi ﬁ cant  $p$  -value (0.003) in dominant model and p-value (0.057) in recessive model mentioned by the authors in their results was indeed for the signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity (I square:  $67.4\%$   in dominant model & I square:  $48.9\%$   in recessive model) present between the studies included in the meta-analysis and not for the risk of IS. Thus, the results of the meta-analysis published by Wen D et al. must be interpreted with caution.  

MMP-9 (gelatinase B), a   $92\,\mathrm{kDa}$   protein is mainly known for cleaving types IV and V collagen protein ( Bur a czy nsk a et al., 2015 ; Fenhalls et al., 1999 ;  Pour mo tabbed et al., 1994 ). MMP-9 is highly expressed in at hero sclerotic plagues and plays a key role in blood brain barrier disruption ( Barr et al., 2010 ) leading to hemorrhagic transformation ( Jha et al., 2014 ). The T allele of ( – 1562C/T) gene polymorphism of MMP-9 has been found to be associated with an increased incidence of IS ( Nie et al., 2014 ). Till now, the role of MMP-9 ( – 1562C/ T) gene polymorphism in the clinical outcome after IS is uncertain ( Manso et al., 2010 ). Our meta-analysis of 17 studies with 2818 cases and 2632 controls con ﬁ rmed the role of MMP-9 ( – 1562C/T) as a risk factor for IS. When strati ﬁ ed on the basis of ethnicity, the MMP-9 ( – 1562C/T) gene polymorphism was found to be a risk factor for both Asian as well as Caucasian populations. Several meta-analyses in the past have tried to determine an association between MMP-9 ( – 1562C/ T) gene polymorphism and risk of IS. A recent meta-analysis conducted by  He et al. (2017)  of 14 studies also con ﬁ rmed our  ﬁ ndings and found an association between MMP-9 ( – 1562C/T) and risk of IS. They found a signi ﬁ cant association in Chinese population but not in the Caucasian population. Another meta-analysis published last year by Liu X et al. (2016) of 13 studies also followed the same trend and observed a signi ﬁ cant association between MMP-9 ( – 1562C/T) and risk of IS ( Liu et al., 2016 ). However, previously published meta-analyses by  Wen et al. (2014)  of three studies and  Fan et al. (2014)  of six studies indicated that the  – 1562C/T gene polymorphism of MMP-9 was not a risk factor for stroke. Although, the number of studies included in these meta-analyses were very few to draw any profound conclusions. MMP-12 (Macrophage metal loe last as e), a   $54\,\mathrm{kDa}$   protein is known

to play a crucial part in the path o physiology of IS. MMP-12 leads to the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-3 ( Matsumoto et al., 1998 ). The MMP12   $\mathrm{\check{-}\,1082\,A/G)}$   was found to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with the risk of IS in our meta-analysis. The A allele of MMP-12   $(-1082\;\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{G})$  ) gene polymorphism leads to an increase in the MMP-12 expression ( Chehaibi et al., 2014a ) by having a high a ﬃ nity for transcription factor activator protein-1 ( Jormsjö et al., 2000 ). No study has observed any direct association between MMP-12   $(-1082\;\mathrm{\AA}/\mathrm{G})$   gene polymorphism and clinical outcome after IS. Only two studies have examined the role of  $-1082\;\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{G}$   polymorphism of MMP-12 gene and both have reported a signi ﬁ cant association with the risk of causing IS ( Buss et al., 2009 ; Chehaibi et al., 2014b ).  

Although conducted comprehensively, the results of our meta-analysis must be considered in light of few limitations. The studies included in our meta-analysis varied in terms of ethnicity, age and environmental factors. Di ﬀ erent methodologies were used for genotyping method, selection of controls and matching criteria, which may have led to heterogeneity. We could not study the SNP-phenotype association by taking into account the e ﬀ ect of important risk factors (i.e. cholesterol levels, smoking) for IS due to lack of availability of individual patient data. Therefore, more credible evidences are required to conﬁ rm the association of various MMP family gene polymorphisms with risk of IS.  

# 5. Conclusion  

This is the largest comprehensive meta-analysis which suggests that MMP-9 ( – 1562C/T) and MMP-12   $(-1082\mathrm{~}\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G})$   gene polymorphisms could be a risk factor for IS while MMP-1   $\textup{(}-1607\ 1\textup{G}/2\textup{G})$  , MMP-2  $\left(-1306\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T}\right)$   &   $(-735\mathrm{C/T})$   and MMP-3 ( − 1612 5A/6A) have no association with the risk of causing IS. The MMP-9 ( – 1562C/T) and MMP1  $\mathfrak{L}\left(-1082\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{G}\right)$   gene polymorphisms could be used as genetic markers in future for screening the susceptibility to IS. Current data provides evidence for the role of MMP-9 and MMP-12 polymorphisms in IS, but elucidation of the role of other MMP gene variants in IS will depend on better study design, including a larger sample size, extensive screening of individual genes with haplotype analysis and replication of studies to avoid publication bias.
