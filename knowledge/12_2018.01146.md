# Summary  

The association between the mevalonate kinase gene ( MVK ) single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP) and serum lipid levels has been detected in several previous genome-wide association  studies, but the results are inconsistent. In addition, it is still unclear whether the loci  indent if i ed exert the similar effect on the susceptibility of coronary heart disease (CHD) or  ischemic stroke (IS). Therefore, the present study was undertaken to detect the association  between the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP and serum lipid levels, the susceptibility of CHD and  IS in a Southern Chinese Han population. The genotypes of the SNP in 1764 unrelated  subjects (CHD, 583; IS, 555; and healthy controls, 626) were determined by the Snapshot  technology. The genotypic and allelic frequencies were different between CHD and control  subjects (  $(P\leq0.013\$   for each), or between IS and control groups   $(P<0.01\$   for each). The T  allele carriers had an increased risk of CHD and IS (CHD:   $\mathbf{OR}=1.674$  ,  $\bf95\%$     $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{I}=1.25–2.25$  ,   $\mathbf{\mathit{P}}=\mathbf{0.001}$   for CT/TT  vs . CC genotypes;   $\mathbf{OR}=1.595$  ,  $\bf95\%$     $\mathbf{CI}=1.23–2.07$  ,   $\textstyle P<\mathbf{0.001}$   for T  vs .  C alleles; IS:   $\mathbf{OR}=1.890$  ,   $\bf95\%$     $\mathbf{CI}=1.36–2.47$  ,  $\mathbf{\mathit{P}}=\mathbf{0.001}$   for CT/TT  vs . CC genotypes; OR   $\mathbf{\lambda}=1.829$  ,   $\bf95\%$     $\mathbf{CI}=1.38–2.42$  ,  $\mathbf{\mathit{P}}<\mathbf{0.001}$   for T  vs . C alleles). The T allele carriers in healthy  controls had lower serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than the  T allele non-carriers   $\left(P=0.013\right)$  ). These findings suggest that the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP is  likely to increase the risk of CHD and IS by decreasing serum HDL-C levels in our study  populations.

# 1. Introduction  

Among the non-communicable disease, cardiovascular  and circulatory disease primarily made up by ischemic  heart disease   $(5.2\%)$  , hemorrhagic stroke   $(2.5\%)$  ,  ischemic stroke (IS,   $1.6\%$  ), and hypertensive heart   $(0.6\%)$  , accounted of   $11.8\%$   of global disabilityadjusted life years (DALYS) ( 1 ). More than 2.5 and  1 million persons suffered from the stroke and heart  attack, resulting in more than 2 million deaths each  year in China ( 2 ). The location of coronary heart  disease (CHD) and IS was different, but they may  share the common risk factors such as hypertension,  dys lipid emi a and metabolic syndrome ( 3 ), and the  same path o physiological basis: atherosclerosis ( 4 ).  Dys lipid emi a such as low concentration of high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), high levels of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol  (TC) and triglyceride (TG) was one of the most important  risk factors for CHD ( 5,6 ) and IS ( 7,8 ). It is well-known  that the disorder of lipid metabolism is a complex  characteristic, resulted from multiple environmental and  genetic factors and their interactions ( 9,10 ). Twins and  family studies indicated that disorder of lipid metabolism  was influenced by genetic and environmental factors,  which might contribute to the individual discrepancy in  the serum lipid profiles   $(l l)$  .  

Previous genome-wide association studies 

 (GWASes) have found the association of several novel  loci in the mevalonate kinase gene ( MVK , also as:  MK ;  LRBP ;  MVLK ;  POROK3 ) and serum lipid levels  ( 12,13 ). The  MVK  was located at chromosome 12q24 

 ( 12,13 ) and encoded the mevalonate kinase (MVK) 

 ( 14 ). MVK was a key early enzyme in isoprenoid  and sterol synthesis metabolism, which implicated to  affect HDL-C levels ( 12,15 ). Mutations in the  MVK   gave rise to hyper immunoglobulin emi a D syndrome 

 (HIDS), in which low HDL-C levels could be found 

  $(l6)$  , in accordance with the latest GWAS findings 

 ( 12,13 ). Several novel loci in  MVK  were confirmed  to be associated with serum HDL-C levels ( 17-19 )  and an increased risk of CHD and IS ( 19 ). But no  significant association between the  MVK  rs2287218  SNP and serum lipid levels was conducted by Sun  et  al . in a Northern Chinese Han population ( 20 ). To our  knowledge, the genetic evidence on the associations  between the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP and serum lipid  levels, and the susceptibility of CHD or IS in a  Southern Chinese Han population has not been reported  previously. Therefore, the present study was undertaken  to detect the association between the  MVK  rs2287218  SNP and serum lipid levels, and the susceptibility of  CHD and IS in a Southern Chinese Han population.  

# 2. Materials and Methods  

# 2.1.  Study patients  

A total of 1138 patients with CHD   $(n=583)$  ) and IS ( n  $=555$  ) were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital,  Guangxi Medical University. The age of these patients  ranged from 23 to 87 years with a mean age of   $62.26\pm$  10.51 years in CHD and   $62.85\pm12.32$   years in IS. All  of enrolled CHD patients were evaluated by coronary  angiography. The coronary angiograms were analyzed by  two experienced interventional cardiologist. CHD was  defined as severe coronary stenosis   $(\geq50\%)$   in at least  either one of the three main coronary arteries or their  major branches (branch diameter  $\geq2\;\mathrm{mm}$  ). Subjects with  congenital heart disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus  (T1DM) were excluded in the study. All of enrolled  IS patients received a strict neurological examination  and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis  of IS was according to the International Classification  of Diseases (9th Revision). Patients with a transient  ischemic attack, embolic brain infarction, stroke caused  by inflammatory disease, or serious chronic diseases  were excluded from the study. The CHD patients who  had a past history of IS, or the IS cases who had a past  history of CHD were also excluded from the study ( 21 ).  

# 2.2.  Controls  

A control group of 626 subjects matched by age,  gender, and nationality was also included in the study.  They were randomly selected from the healthy adults  who underwent periodical check-up at our hospital  during the same period when CHD and IS patients  recruited. The average age of the participants was   $61.95\,\pm\,10.01$   years. They were free from CHD and  IS at time of history taking, clinical, biochemical,  and image examinations such as 64-slice computed  tomo graphic coronary angiography. Information on  demography, medical history and lifestyle was collected  with standardized questionnaires. This study design  was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First  Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University (No.  Lunshen 2009-Guike-018). Informed consent was  obtained from all participants before the study.  

# 2.3.  Biochemical measurements  

A fasting venous blood sample of   $5~\mathrm{ml}$   was obtained  from the participants. A part of the sample (  $(2~\mathrm{mL})$  )  was collected into glass tubes and used to determine  serum lipid levels. Another part of the sample (  $(3~\mathrm{mL}$  )  was transferred to tubes with anticoagulant s   $(4.80~\mathrm{g/}$  L citric acid,   $14.70~\mathrm{g/L}$   glucose and   $13.20~\mathrm{g/L}$   trisodium citrate) and used to extract deoxyribonucleic  acid (DNA). Measurements of serum TC, TG, HDL-C,  and LDL-C levels in the samples were performed by  enzymatic methods with commercially available kits  (RANDOX Laboratories Ltd., Ardmore, Diamond  Road, and Crumlin Co. Antrim, United Kingdom, BT29  4QY; Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).  Serum apo lipoprotein (Apo) A1 and ApoB levels were  detected by the immuno turbid i metric immuno as say  using a commercial kit (RANDOX Laboratories Ltd.).  All determinations were performed with an autoanalyzer (Type 7170A; Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in  the Clinical Science Experiment Center of the First  Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University ( 22 ).  

# 2.4.  Genotyping  

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood  leukocytes using the phenol-chloroform method.  Genotyping of the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP was performed  by the Snapshot technology platform in the Center for  Human Genetics Research, Shanghai Genesky BioTech Co. Ltd., China ( 23 ). The restriction enzyme for  the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP was SAP (Promega) and  Exon ucl easel (Epicentre). The sense and antisense  primers were 5'-CT GC GG GAGA GTC A CGT TTC AC-3'  and   $5^{\prime}$  -GAG G GAC ACT G GCC A GG TAAG G-3',  respectively.  

# 2.5.  Diagnostic criteria  

The normal values of serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C,  ApoA1, ApoB levels and the ApoA1/ApoB ratio in  our Clinical Science Experiment Center were 3.10-

 5.17, 0.56-1.70, 0.91-1.81, 2.70-3.20 mmol/L; 1.00-

 1.78  $;,\,0.63\!-\!1.14\mathrm{~g/L~}$  ; and 1.00-2.50; respectively ( 24 ).  The individuals with   $\mathrm{TC}>5.17\ \mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L}$  and/or TG   $>1.70\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$   were defined as hyper lipid emi c ( 25 ).  LDL $.\mathrm{C}\geq3.20\,\mathrm{\mmol/L}$   was defined as high lowdensity lipoprotein emi a   $(26)$  . Hypertension was  diagnosed according to the 1999 and 2003 criteria of  the World Health Organization-International Society  of Hypertension Guidelines for the management of  hypertension ( 27 ). The diagnostic criteria of overweight  and obesity were according to the Cooperative MetaAnalysis Group of China Obesity Task Force. Normal  weight, overweight and obesity were defined as a  body mass index (BMI)  $<24$  , 24-28 and  $>28~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  ,  respectively ( 28 ).  

2.6.  Statistical analyses  

The statistical analyses were performed with the  statistical software package SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc.,  Chicago, Illinois). The quantitative variables were  presented as mean  $\pm$   standard deviation (serum TG levels  were presented as medians and interquartile ranges).  Allelic frequency was determined via direct counting,  and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was verified with  the standard goodness-of-fit test. The sex ratio and  genotypic distribution between the two groups were  analyzed by the chi-square test. General characteristics  between patients and controls were compared by the  Student's unpaired   $t.$  -test. The association between  genotypes and serum lipid parameters was tested by  covariance analysis (ANCOVA). Unconditional logistic  regression was used to assess the correlation between  the risk of CHD or IS and genotypes. Gender, age,  BMI, blood pressure, alcohol consumption and cigarette  smoking were adjusted for the statistical analysis. Odds  ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI) were  calculated by using unconditional logistic regression.  Results were considered to be statistically significant if  two-sided  $P$   value was less than 0.05.  

# 3. Results  

3.1.  Clinical characteristics of the subjects  

The clinical characteristics of the subjects are described  in Table 1. The male to female ratio, mean age, serum  LDL-C and ApoB levels were not different between  the control and experimental groups (  $\textstyle P>0.05$   for all).  As compared with the CHD and IS patients, the control  subjects had higher serum TC, HDL-C, ApoA1 levels  and the ApoA1/ApoB ratio   $(P<0.05)$  ). The body height,  weight, average BMI, systolic blood pressure, pulse  pressure, the prevalence of hypertension, TG levels and  the percentages of subjects who smoked cigarettes and  did not drink alcohol were lower in the control than in  CHD and IS groups   $(P<0.05)$  ). In addition, the control  subjects had lower diastolic blood pressure levels than  the IS patients   $(P<0.01)$  ).

The value of triglyceride was presented as  median (interquartile range); the difference among the genotypes was determined by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The remaining characteristics  between patients and controls were tested by the Student's unpaired-test.  

# 3.2.  Genotypic and allelic frequencies  

The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs2287218  SNP are presented in Figure 1. The genotypic and  allelic frequencies were different between the CHD/ IS and control groups   $(P<0.05)$  . The C and   $\mathrm{T}$   allele  frequencies were   $88.7\%$   and   $11.3\%$   in controls,   $84.8\%$    and   $15.2\%$   in CHD, and   $84.1\%$   and   $15.9\%$   in IS  patients; respectively. The CC, CT and TT genotype  frequencies were   $78.4\%$  ,   $20.6\%$   and   $1.0\%$   in controls;   $72.0\%$  ,   $25.6\%$   and   $2.4\%$   in CHD; and   $71.0\%$  ,   $26.1\%$    and   $2.9\%$   in IS patients; respectively. The genotypic  distribution was in accordance with the HardyWeinberg equilibrium in the three groups   $(P>0.05)$  ).

# 3.3.  The rs2287218 SNP and the risk of CHD or IS  

The   $\mathrm{T}$   allele carriers had an increased risk of CHD and  IS (CHD:  $\mathrm{{OR}=1.674}$  ,   $95\%$   $5\%\;\mathrm{CI}=1.25–2.25$  ,  $P=0.001$  for CT/TT  vs .

C alleles) after adjusting for age, gender, BMI,  smoking status, alcohol consumption and hypertension.  

3.4.  Gene-environment interactions on the risk of CHD  or IS  

Stratified analysis showed that an increased risk of CHD  and IS was found in subjects with CT/TT genotypes,  especially in those who belonged to one of the following  categories: females, elder   $\mathrm{>60}$   years), low BMI   $(<24$     $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$  ), nonsmokers and nondrinkers (Table 2).  

# 3.5.  Related risk factors for CHD and IS  

As shown in Table 3, multivariate logistic analysis  showed that the incidence of CHD and IS was  positively correlated with smoking, high BMI   $(\geq24\;\mathrm{kg}/$   $\mathrm{m}^{2})$  ), hypertension and CT/TT genotypes, whereas it  was negatively associated with alcohol consumption.  There was also a positive association between the  incidence of CHD and hyper lipid emi a, but not between  the incidence of IS and hyper lipid emi a.

As shown in Figure 2, the subjects with CT/TT  genotypes in control group had lower serum HDL-C  levels than those with CC genotype   $\left(P=0.013\right)$  ). There  was no difference in the remaining lipid parameters  between the CT/TT and CC genotypes (  $P>0.05$   for  all).  

# 4. Discussion  

A considerable amount of literatures showed that  blood lipid metabolism was closely related to the  occurrence and development of atherosclerosis and  cardiovascular disease (CVD) ( 29,30 ). As a significant  monitoring indicator of CVD, dys lipid emi a is a  complex and multi factorial disease, resulting from  multiple environmental factors, including age, sex,  obesity, abnormal glucose, hypertension, lifestyle  and daily exercise ( 31,32 ), genetic factors, and their  interactions ( 33,34 ). The SNP was the most abundant  genetic variation in the human genome, which was  manifested in the substitution mutation of a single  base. SNP could be used to explain the individual  phenotypic discrepancy and the susceptibility of  different groups and individuals to some diseases. So,  to identify the gene mutations regulating the serum  lipid profiles and increasing the risk of CHD or IS has  received considerable critical attentions, especially in  the development of new markers for risk stratification  assessment, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of  CVD.  

The principal finding of the present study was a  significant association between the  MVK  rs2287218  SNP and serum HDL-C levels in a Southern Chinese  Han population. The subjects with CT/TT genotypes in  healthy controls had lower serum HDL-C levels than  the subjects with CC genotype (  $\textstyle P=0.013$  ). Recent  GWASes have found that several novel loci in  MVK   could influence HDL-C concentrations ( 12,13 ). The  subjects with GG genotype (the major homozygote)  of the  MVK  S52N had lower HDL-C levels than the  subjects with AA genotype   $(l\,7)$  . The associations  between the   $M V K\,\mathrm{rs}2338104$  SNP and HDL-C levels  were definitive (  $\textstyle P<0.001)$   and consistent ( 18,35 ). In  addition, the  MVK  rs 3759387 A A genotype had lower  HDL-C levels than the rs 3759387 AC/CC genotypes  ( 19 ). Furthermore,  MVK  (  $\mathrm{i}85\mathrm{G{\rightarrow}T}$   and   $\mathrm{S52NG{\rightarrow}A}$  ) had  low HDL-C levels linked to dietary habit, especially in  carbohydrates intakes ( 17 ). These studies suggested that  the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP, as a member of  MVK , may  be linked to HDL-C levels. In the present study, our  results in accordance with the latest GWAS findings  ( 12,13 ) may be reasonable. But Sun  et al . showed that  there was no significant association between the  MVK   rs2287218 SNP and serum lipid levels in a Northern  Chinese Han population ( 20 ). The precise reason  for these conflicting results was unknown. Because  blood lipid metabolism genes were multilocus and  multivariate, the locations and properties of different  populations may be diverse. The relationships between  the same genetic frequency and serum lipid levels may  not be the same in different ethnic groups or geographic  areas ( 36 ). On one hand, in addition to sample size  and different statistical methods, they were different  in exposed environments. It was reported that serum  lipid levels and the prevalence of dys lipid emi a were  influenced by multiple environmental factors, such  as dietary habit ( 37 ), lifestyle ( 38 ), daily exercise 

 ( 39 ). Junyent  et al . found that  MVK  (  $\mathrm{i}85\mathrm{G{\rightarrow}T}$   and 

  $\mathrm{S52NG{\rightarrow}A}$  ) had low HDL-C levels linked to dietary  habit, especially in carbohydrates intakes ( 17 ). On the  other hand, their genetic background was not similar,  which may contribute to the discrepancies between our  and the other studies in different populations. In the  present study, we showed that the  MVK  rs2287218T  allele frequency was   $14.0\%$   in the Guangxi Han  population. According to the International 1000  Genomes data-base ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ variation/tools/1000 genomes/ ), the  MVK  rs2287218T  allele frequency was   $10.7\%$   in Han Chinese in Beijing,  China (CHB);   $13.9\%$   in Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT); 

  $21.9\%$   in African Car rib beans in Barbados (ACB); 

  $17.2\%$   in Americans of African ancestry in SW USA 

 (ASW); and   $17.2\%$   in Mexican ancestry from Los  Angeies USA (MXL). These results showed that the  prevalence of the  MVK  rs2287218T allele was higher  in North American or in European than in Asian. The  minor allele frequency of the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP was  also different between Southern and Northern Chinese  populations. These findings revealed that the   $M V K$  rs2287218 SNP has a racial/ethnic and geographic  specificity.  

The MVK exists in a wide range of organisms  from bacteria to human and is a key early enzyme in  isoprenoid and sterol synthesis metabolism ( 12,15 ).  The  MVK  was modified by sterol-responsive elementblinding protein 2 (SREBP2) by sharing a promoter,  which was a transcription factor that played a vital  role in controlling cholesterol homeostasis   $(40)$  .  Moreover, it was also reported that  MVK  took part  in metabolic pathways and had an effect on HDL-C  metabolism in the previous study.  MVK  mutations,  especially in homo zy gos it y, or the   $M V K$   deficiency  caused hyper immuno glob u-linemia D syndrome  (HIDS), in which the basic symptoms were recurrent  episodes of fever and high concentrations of  immunoglobulin (Ig) D and A in blood ( 16 ). When  the patients suffered from HIDS, low HDL-C levels  could be found, in accordance with the latest GWAS  findings ( 12,13 ). In some previous studies, the  increased immunoglobulin containing IgD and IgA  contributed to the low levels of HDL-C ( 41,42 ). It was  likely that the immunoglobulin synthesis took a lot of  nutrients, such as albumin and cholesterol, resulting in  decreased HDL-C levels. It was worth mentioning that  the statins were reported to be applied in the treatment  of HIDS by inhibiting the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glut ary l  coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and the proinflammatory cytokines ( 43 ). These results indicated  that the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP could influence serum  HDL-C levels. However, the precise mechanism  of  MVK  on serum lipid metabolism remains to be  explored.  

Another important finding in the current study was  that the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP was strongly associated  with the risk of CHD and IS in the Guangxi Han  population. The frequencies of the TT/CT genotypes  and T allele were associated with an increased risk of  CHD and IS after adjusting for potential confounding  factors. Multivariate analysis showed that the known  factors, such as cigarette smoking, high BMI   $(\geq24$     $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$  ), hypertension, hyper lipid emi a and the TT/CT  genotypes were dependent ly associated with CHD.  Meanwhile, the occurrence of IS was positively  correlated with cigarette, high BMI, hypertension  and the TT/CT genotypes. Both CHD and IS were  negatively correlated with the  MVK  rs2287218 CC  genotype and alcohol consumption. We also found  that the drinkers, especially moderate alcohol, had a  lower risk of CVD than non-drinkers ( 44 ). The effects  of alcohol on lipid metabolism, especially the HDLC-elevating effects ( 45 ), were considered to greatly  promote the cardio-protective action of alcohol ( 46 ).  In the stratified analysis, the increased risk of CHD  and IS in subjects with the CT and TT genotypes was  mainly observed in females, age  $>60$   years,   ${\mathrm{BM}}<$   $24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  , nonsmokers and nondrinkers. Significant  interactions between the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP and  environmental factors on the risk of CHD or IS  were observed in those of females, nonsmokers and  nondrinkers. The subjects with CT/TT genotypes of  the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP contributed to the increased  risk of CHD and IS. A previous study confirmed that  the  MVK  rs3759387 AC/CC genotypes interacted  with some environmental exposures (such as males,  elder), resulting in increasing the risk of CHD and IS  ( 19 ), which suggested gene-environment interactions  contributed to higher risk of CHD and IS. It was  reported that the  MVK  variants displayed low HDL-C  levels and an activity decline of the MVK. The high  levels of HDL-C could regulate moncytes proliferation  and activation, changing the composition of the  myeloid cell lineage, which was thought to generate  beneficial anti-inflammatory and athero-protective  effects to prevent CVD ( 47,48 ). In addition, the  activity of the MVK played a key role in controlling  cholesterol homeostasis ( 13 ) and HDL-C metabolism.  Elimination of the MVK activity caused low HDL-C  levels in HIDS and increased atherosclerosis. It has  been demonstrated that the abnormal blood lipid  metabolism is closely related to the occurrence and  development of atherosclerosis and CVD ( 29,30 ).  Therefore, the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP was likely to  increase the risk of CHD and IS by reducing serum  HDL-C levels without anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective effects. Besides, the frequencies of genotype  and allele were statistically significant between the  CHD or IS and control groups. The frequency of the   $M V K\,{\mathrm{rs}}2287218{\mathrm{T}}$   allele was higher in the CHD   $(15.2\%)$    and IS   $(15.9\%)$   patients than in the controls   $11.3\%$  ,  $P$     $=0.005)$  ). According to the International 1000 Genomes  data-base, the frequency of the  $M V K\,{\mathrm{rs}}2287218{\mathrm{T}}$   allele  was diverse in different racial groups and geographic  areas. We also showed that the frequencies of TT/ CT genotypes were higher in the CHD   $(28.0\%)$   and  IS   $(29.0\%)$   patients than in the controls   $(21.6\%$  ,  $P\le$  0.01 for each). In addition, a previous study indicated  that the  MVK  expression levels were different in some  tissues ( 49 ). These findings suggested that the  MVK   rs2287218 SNP may be a susceptibility to CHD and  IS. It was likely to increase the risk of CHD and IS  by decreasing the serum HDL-C levels. However,  large genetic association studies or meta-analyses are  necessary to further explore these associations between  them.  

The present study had several potential limitations.  Firstly, the number of involved patients was relatively  small compared to many previous GWASs and  replication studies. Therefore, further studies with  larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our findings.  Secondly, a number of patients with CHD or IS took  anti-at hero sclerotic drugs, such as statins, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and  aspirin when they were enrolled in the study, whereas  the controls did not take any medicine. The levels  of TC and LDL-C were lower in the patients with  CHD or IS than in the healthy controls. However, the  drug information was missing for some IS and CHD  patients. Finally, only one  MVK  SNP was studied in  this study. The interaction of the  MVK  SNP-SNP on  serum lipid profiles and the susceptibility of CHD  and IS was not observed. Therefore, the observed  associations need further replications to avoid spurious  associations.  

# 5. Conclusion  

The  MVK  rs2287218 SNP was associated with serum  HDL-C levels and the susceptibility of CHD and IS  in a Southern Chinese Han population. The T allele  carriers had an increased risk of CHD and IS. The T  allele carriers in healthy controls had lower serum  HDL-C levels than the T allele non-carriers. These  findings suggest that the  MVK  rs2287218 SNP is likely  to increase the risk of CHD and IS by decreasing serum  HDL-C levels.
