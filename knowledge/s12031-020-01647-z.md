# Abstract  

SNP rs2043211 in  CARD8  was found to have significant association with ischemic stroke. This study aimed to explore the possible association between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese and explain the possible mechanism. In total, 716 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and 1088 controls were included in the study. Co-dominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models were constructed to evaluate the relationship between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke risk by odds ratios with  $95\%$   confidence intervals. Stratified and interaction analyses were also done. We selected another 111 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and measured the CARD8 levels in their plasma samples by enzyme-linked immuno s or bent assay. Participants who carry  $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotype have a higher risk of large-artery atherosclerosis stroke compared with those carry A/T or A/A genotypes (odds ratio  $=1.35$  ,  $95\%$   confidence intervals 1.03 – 1.77,    $P\!=\!0.029$  ). The higher risk for the T/T genotype is still notable in female, people with hypertension, and people without diabetes. In the interaction analysis, compared to the non-hypertensive participants with the wild homozygote type A/A, the hypertensive participants with the   $\mathrm{A/T+}$  T/T homozygote had 3.27-fold increased risk (odds ratio  $=3.27$  ,   $95\%$   confidence intervals 2.33 – 4.60). The A/A group had lower CARD8 levels in plasma than the  $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{T}$   and  $\mathrm{T/T}$   group   $(P\!<\!0.001)$  ). Further bioinformatics prediction indicated that the rs2043211 could significantly influence the mRNA secondary structure and protein expression of  CARD8  (eQTL    $P\,{=}\,9.8\times10^{-198}$  ). The rs2043211 is probably a novel biomarker for large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese.

# Introduction  

Stroke has become the top three causes of death and chronic disability worldwide (GBD 2017 DALYs and HALE Collaborators  2018 ). Ischemic stroke (IS) accounts for approximate ly   $80\%$   of all strokes. Large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke, classified according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) (Adams et al.  1993 )  

criteria, is a major subtype of IS in Chinese. At hero sclerotic stenosis or occlusion of intra cranial and extra cranial arteries caused by a disorder of lipid metabolism is the primary cause for LAA stroke (Esenwa and Elkind  2016 ). Previous studies have found that the LAA stroke is not only related to traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking (Hankey  2017 ), but also to a series of specific gene locus (Amouyel  2012 ). For LAA stroke, the heritability was   $40.3\%$   (Bevan et al.  2012 ). Via genomewide association studies (GWAS), many single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites have been found and further experimental verification is needed (Traylor et al.  2012 ).  

CARD8 has a structure of a CARD domain at C-terminal and a function to find (FIIND) domain at N-terminal. It can act as an adaptor molecule to negatively regulate caspase-1- dependent IL $1\,\upbeta$   generation and inhibits activation of NF $\kappa\mathbf{B}$   (nuclear factor-kappa B) (Zhang et al.  2017 ). The FIIND domain can combine with the NOD domain of an active in fl amma some complex NLRP3 (Agostini et al. 2004 ). Mice that lack components of the NLRP3 in fl amma some in their bone marrow resist the development of cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis (Duewell et al.  2010 ). Also,  CARD8  is a downstream gene regulated by a long noncoding RNA at the   $\mathrm{Chr9p21}$   locus — ANRIL — which is considered a prime candidate for atherosclerosis (Holdt and Teupser  2012 ).  

SNP rs2043211 is an   $_\mathrm{A>T}$   variant in the  CARD8  (p.C10X). It has been proved to have an association with gout (Chen et al.  2015 ), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Liu et al. 2015 ), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Verma et al.  2008 ), and Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) (Fontalba et al.  2008 ) in recent investigations. A meta-analysis reported in 2018 showed that CARD8 rs2043211 polymorphism is a risk locus for cardiovascular diseases (Huang et al.  2018 ). But the actual function of this SNP in vivo is not clear.  

Thus, we hypothesize that this polymorphism may have special effects on LAA stroke. A case-control study was designed to validate the possible association between the rs2043211 and LAA stroke in a Chinese population.  

# Methods  

# Study Population  

In this case-control study, 716 LAA stroke patients and 1088 controls were from Yixing City, Jiangsu Province (Yang et al. 2018 ). The definition of stroke is a vessel-related sudden focal neurological deficit over   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  , and the cerebral infarction evidence corresponded to clinical manifestation is proved by head CT and/or MRI. The inclusion criteria of LAA group are as follows: (1) Chinese Han population, (2) aged 18 years or older, (3) first diagnosed as LAA stroke according to the TOAST criteria when registered, and (4) blood samples were left for detection. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) other kinds of IS according to the TOAST criteria, (2) hemorrhagic diseases, (3) autoimmune diseases, (4) liver or kidney dysfunction, and (5) tumor. The control group was Han adult (age  $>18$   years old) residents who had no cardiovascular disease during the same period of health examination. Individuals with tumor, autoimmune diseases, or liver or kidney dysfunction were also excluded from the controls. The characteristics of the participants including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a, and status of smoking are obtained by trained research staff via questionnaire or laboratory examination. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Jingling Hospital, Nanjing, China and each participant gave an informed consent before this study.  

# Genotyping  

SNPscan technique provided by Genesky Biotechnology Inc. (Shanghai, China) was used to genotype rs2043211. Blank controls were set up to evaluate the reliability of detection. About  $5\%$   of the samples were randomly selected for repeated verification, and the consistency rate was   $100\%$  . The genotype of those with unclear genotype was re-typed.  

# CARD8 Quantitative Measurement  

Plasma samples of 111 LAA stroke patients from Nanjing Stroke Registry Program (NJSR) were available (Liu et al. 2006 ). We detected the CARD8 protein concentration by enzyme-linked immuno s or bent assay (ELISA) kit (mlbio, China). A standard curve was drawn by the standard sample absorbance at   $450\;\mathrm{nm}$   for each plate and the CARD8 level in the plasma was calculated according to the standard curve.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Numerical variable is presented as the mean (SD, standard deviations) and compared by Student ’ s  t  test. Categorical variables are expressed by numbers and percentages and tested by chi-square test between groups. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test of the control group and the allele frequency distribution of two groups were examined by the chi-square test. The relationship between rs2043211 polymorphism and LAA stroke was analyzed by logistic regression analysis, calculated by crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\%$  confidence intervals (CIs). Stratified and interaction analyses were done under the appropriate genetic model. Statistical significance was considered as  $P\!<\!0.05$   (  $\alpha\!=\!0.05$  , two-tailed). R 3.5.1 and SNPStats web tool ( https://www.snpstats.net/ start.htm , 2019-06-30) (Sole et al.  2006 ) were used for data processing and analysis.

# Results  

There was no significant difference in age and sex distribution between LAA stroke patients and the control group. Obvious difference was seen between LAA stroke patients and controls in the hypertension, diabetes, and smoking (  ${\cal P}\!<\!0.001$  , Table  1 ).  

There was no significant difference in the distribution of three genotypes of the rs2043211 between the LAA stroke patients and controls   $(P\!=\!0.088)$  ). In the control groups, the allele frequency distribution was consistent with HWE  $(P\!>\!0.05)$  .  

We found that the rs2043211 variant homozygote T/T was associated with a significantly increased risk of LAA stroke  $(\mathrm{OR}=1.35$  ,  $95\%$   CI 1.03 – 1.77 in the co-dominant genetic model;  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.16$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.02 – 1.33 in the log-additive genetic model). The results were still significant after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, and diabetes (Table  2 ).  

To further characterize the association between rs2043211 and LAA stroke, we conducted stratified analysis by age, sex, hypertension, and diabetes under the co-dominant model (Fig.  1 ). After adjustment for the other factors, the higher risk for a T/T genotype is still notable in female (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}}=$  2.35,  $,95\%\,\mathrm{CI}\,1.46{-}3.80,P{<}\,0.001)$  ), people with hypertension

 (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=1.61$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.10 – 2.36,  $P\,{=}\,0.014$  ), and people without diabetes (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.37$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.01 – 1.86,  $P\!=\!0.045)$  ).  

Hypertension is widely recognized to be a risk factor of cerebro vascular disease. Our stratified analysis showed that hypertensive people with a   $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotype have a higher risk of LAA stroke. We did an interaction analysis among three genotypes to calculate the adjusted increased risk (Table  3 ). Compared to the non-hypertensive population with the wild homozygote type   $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{A}$  , the hypertensive population with the  $\mathrm{A/T{+}T/T}$   genotype had 3.27-fold increased risk   $(\mathrm{OR}\,\!=\!3.27$  ,  $95\%$   CI 2.33 – 4.60,  $P$   for interaction  $=0.035$  ).  

In our test for CARD8 level in plasma, the results of 111 cases were obtained after excluding the maximum (over mean  $\mathrm{~+~}2\mathrm{SD})$   and minimum (below mean  − 2SD) values. It was found that the wild   $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{A}$   homozygote group had lower CARD8 levels   $(17.27\pm5.42~\mathrm{ng/mL})$  ), and the risk allele T increased the expression of CARD8   $(31.10\pm16.62~\mathrm{ng/mL})$  ). There was a significant difference between the two groups (  ${\cal P}\!<\!0.001$  , Fig.  2 ).  

We predicted mRNA secondary structure by RNA structure web tool (Bellaousov et al.  2013 ) ( http://rna.urmc.rochester. edu/RNA structure Web/ , 2018-12-01, Fig.  3a ) and protein structure map of the CARD8 isoform by RaptorX (Kallberg et al.  2012 ) ( http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/ , 2018-12-01, Fig. 3b ). Rs2043211 can change the mRNA secondary structure, resulting in a generation of termination codon, which in turn stop the CARD8 protein translation process. We searched for the allele frequency distribution of rs 2043211 on Ensembl ( http://asia.ensembl.org/index.html , 2018-11-20, Fig.  3c ). Unlike the European (0.332), East Asians have a higher allele frequency of allele  “ T ”  (0.507). The regulatory function of CARD8 and SNPs near rs2043211 was shown in Fig. 4  based on UCSC Genome (Casper et al.  2018 ) ( http://

Based on HaploReg v4.1 ( http://pubs. broad institute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php , 2019- 11-26), the rs2043211 could significantly influence the binding affinity of Sox_2 and AIRE_2 (Table  4 ).  

# Discussion  

In our study, rs2043211 T allele was associated with an increased risk of LAA stroke. Our power calculation indicated that we have   $90.5\%$   power at a 0.05 significance level to detect an OR of 1.37 with an exposure frequency of   $46\%$   under the current sample size. The previous studies have suggested some relationship between rs2043211 and IS, but the pathogen es is has not been clearly studied. Bai et al. ( 2014 ) found that under the dominant model, rs2043211, may be a risk factor for IS without subtyped   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.19$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.98 – 1.45,  $P\,{=}\,0.075$  ). But under the recessive model, they found rs2043211 had a significant protective effect on IS in both

LAA stroke occurs when cerebral blood flow is interrupted, usually due to arterial thrombosis or embolism (Esenwa and Elkind  2016 ). The secretion of IL $1\upbeta$   by macrophages is the main driving factor of atherosclerosis. High lipid level in the blood can promote the NLRP3 in fl amma some to release IL $1\upbeta$   (Lopes et al.  2015 ). CARD8 is supposed to have interaction with NLRP3 and can negatively regulate the production of   $\operatorname{IL}–1\upbeta$   and inhibit the activation of   $\mathrm{NF}\!-\!\kappa\mathrm{B}$  . Rs2043211 is an   $_\mathrm{A>T}$   variant, which results in a stop codon and truncated protein. The truncated protein could not inhibit the activity of NF $\mathsf{\kappa B}$  , resulting in high levels of IL $.1\upbeta$  . Many studies have found that the rs2043211 in  CARD8  is usually related to the SNPs in  NLRP3.  Their combined polymorphisms have an impact on diseases with atherosclerosis background and diversify the outcome (Roberts et al.  2010 ). In addition, these identified SNPs only explain a small part of

genetic factors. The linkage d is equilibrium (LD) between variants and other heritability also play significant roles. This may explain the controversy over the susceptibility of diseases in people with rs2043211.  

Under the stratified analysis, we found that the effect of rs2043211 on LAA stroke risk could not be observed in people with traditional risk factors. These results may be due to the fact that the effect of a single variant is weaker than that of traditional risk factors. The interaction analysis between hypertension and rs2043211 reflects an increase of susceptibility when the two factors work together. This result may be related to the he mo dynamics of hypertension. High blood pressure is more likely to lead to blood vessel stenosis and occlusion in atherosclerosis caused by rs2043211 related high IL $1\upbeta$   level.  

According to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies on Blood eQTL browser (Westra et al.  2013 ) ( https:// www.gene network.nl/blood eq tl browser/ , 2019-05-20), rs2043211 can affect CARD8 level   $(P\,{=}\,9.8\times10^{-198})$  ) in plasma. Previous study had discovered that TT genotype of rs2043211 increased CARD8 and IL $1\upbeta$   mRNA expression in multiple myeloma patients (Zhao et al.  2018 ). In our ELISA, the CARD8 levels in patients ’  plasma were also increased by the T allele. We did not test the effect of CARD8 p.C10X on the level of other NLRP3 downstream factors. But we can infer that the T allele is related to the high expression of IL $1\,\upbeta$   in the pathological process of LAA stroke. Although, rs2043211 is a stop variant, the termination site is out of the CARD8  domain in the gene and does not reduce the expression of functional protein. In human with carotid atherosclerotic plaque or take on a stroke, the CARD8 expression was higher than that in the control group (Paramel et al.  2013 ). In the follow-up study, we will further clarify the molecular mechanisms for the CARD8 p.C10X regulation by NLRP3 in LAA stroke.  

There are still some deficiencies in our research. Only LAA stroke patients were included in our study, while other subtypes of patients were not included, which may cause a loss of results. However, in terms of etiology and pathogen es is, cardioembolic infarct (CEI) is mainly related to atrial fibrillation, and small vessel occlusive (SVO) is mainly related to vascular diseases caused by hypertension and diabetes. No relationship between CARD8 and atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or diabetes has been found like CARD8 and atherosclerosis. Thus, rs2043211 may not be able to explain the susceptibility of these two subtypes significantly. However, inflammatory response is closely related to the progression of all types of stroke. We will include other stroke subtypes in further study.  

In conclusion, our study shows that the rs2043211 is probably a novel biomarker for large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese. The interactions with other SNPs and a more realistic genetic model of etiology need to be further researched to explain the causal relationship.
