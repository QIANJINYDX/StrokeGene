Abstract  Ph os ph odi est erase 4D (PDE4D) was found to be associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke by Iceland researchers in 2003. Replication studies have produced conflicting results. A recent meta-analysis reported that no genetic variant of PDE4D demonstrated a reproducible association with ischemic stroke, especially when analyzed with respect to white subjects exclusively. In this study, we aimed to determine the association between PDE4D and ischemic infarction risk in Asian populations. After collecting all case – control studies in English or Chinese related to the association between PDE4D and ischemic infarction in Asian people, strict selection criteria and exclusion criteria were determined, and a fixed or random effects model was used on the basis of heterogeneity. To measure the strength of the genetic association, a pooled odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each gene variant. Publication bias was evaluated. None of the Asian subjects were heterozygous for SNP 45 or SNP 41. Only seven studies involving SNP 83 and SNP 87 had sufficient data to allow inclusion into meta-analyses. Statistically significant associations with ischemic infarction in the Asian populations were determined for SNP   $83\mathrm{~C~}$   allele (OR, 1.22;  $95\%$   CI, 1.03 – 1.43) and SNP 83 CC genotype (OR, 1.42;   $95\%$   CI, 1.14 – 1.77), but not for SNP 83  $\mathrm{CC+CT}$   genotypes or SNP 87. PDE4D was associated with ischemic infarction risk in Asian people, and SNP 83 was an important biomarker.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a heterogeneous disease caused by various interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors were not well understood until Icelandic scientists reported in 2003 that the ph os ph odi est erase 4D gene (PDE4D) was associated with the risk of ischemic stroke in the Icelandic population [ 1 ,  2 ]. Since then, 26 replication studies conducted in different countries have been published, but results have been inconsistent [ 3 – 28 ]. In such cases, the greater accuracy and statistical power of a meta-analysis can elucidate the relationship between ischemic stroke and PDE4D.  

One of the major advantages of genetic analysis is that it only takes phenotype into consideration, independent of the complicated physiological and biochemical processes of single-gene and multigene disorders. However, genetic analysis cannot ignore the influence of ethnic differences due to the founder effect and identity by descent principle [ 29 ,  30 ]. According to World Health Organization estimates, nearly 5.5 million people died of stroke in 2002, and more than   $50\%$   of these deaths occurred in Asian countries such as China, Indian, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Korea, and Japan [ 23 ]. Because Asians stroke patients comprise the majority of global stroke patients, understanding the genetic background of stroke in Asian people may improve prevention and intervention and reduce the burden of stroke in those areas.  

This study was conducted to determine the relationship between PDE4D and ischemic infarction risk in Asian populations by meta-analysis. The results will be useful to characterize the function of PDE4D, as well as future p harm a co logical research and clinical work.  

# Methods  

Literature search  

A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all case – control studies and meta-analyses evaluating the association of PDE4D in ischemic cerebral infarction in Asian popula- tions from January 1984 to June 2009 in MEDLINE, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WANFANG DATA. The search terms used were: ischemic cerebral infarction, cerebrovascular disease, stroke, and cerebro vascular disorders, in combination with PDE4D gene, ph os ph odi est erase 4D and gene variant, micro satellite, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The search results were limited to human studies written in English or Chinese. The entire literature search was performed by two independent researchers.  

Inclusion criteria were: well-designed case – control studies of Asian people, neuro imaging data (magnetic resonance imaging or computer tomography) confirmation of an ischemic cerebral infarction diagnosis, and analysis as a dichotomous trait.  

Exclusion criteria were: patients younger than 18 years old, patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) diagnosis, evaluation of quantitative or intermediate phenotypes exclusively, studies in which neither genotype frequency nor allele frequency was reported, or control group deviating from the Hardy – Weinberg distribution. For duplicate publications, the smaller dataset was discarded.  

Statistical analysis  

A meta-analysis was carried out for each genetic variant (SNP or micro satellite) for which data were available from at least three studies. Data were analyzed using Revman 5.0. ( www.cc-ims.net.RevMan ) To measure the strength of the genetic association, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated for each gene variant using a fixed effects model or random effects model, along with the   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI). Test for heterogeneity were performed for each meta-analysis; the fixed effects model was used if there was no statistical difference among all data in one meta-analysis   $_{(P>0.05)}$  ; the random effects model was chosen otherwise.  

Evaluation of publication bias  

Publication bias was assessed by calculating the fail-safe number   $(N_{\mathrm{fs}})$   for each meta-analysis using the following equation:    $N_{\mathrm{fs}}0.05{=}(\sum\!Z/1.64)^{2}{-}k_{,}(P{=}0.05)$   where    $k$   is the number of articles included in each meta-analysis. If the    $N_{\mathrm{fs}}$  for one gene variant was smaller than the number of observed studies, the meta-analysis result of this variant has a significant possibility of publication bias.  

# Results  

Candidate gene variants of PDE4D in the Asian populations  

Our initial search identified a total of 11 manuscripts (Table  1 ) comprising 14 SNPs, one micro satellite, and three haplotypes (Table  2 ), and involved Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Pakistani, and Korean populations. Seven studies were finally selected for the meta-analysis of SNP83 (rs966221) [ 4 ,  8 ,  10 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  25 ], four studies for SNP87 (rs2910829) [ 4 ,  10 ,  20 ,  21 ], five studies for SNP 45

 (rs12188950) [ 4 ,  8 ,  25 – 27 ], and four studies for SNP41

 (rs12153798) [ 3 ,  20 ,  26 ,  27 ].  

No individuals in these studies were heterozygous for SNP 45 and SNP 41; therefore, SNP 45 and SNP 41, which showed the most significant association in the initial study [ 1 ], did not demonstrate an association with the risk of ischemic infarction in Asian populations.  

As for SNP 87 (Table  3 ) and SNP 83 (Table  4 ), which included a total of 4,736 cases and 8,783 controls, metaanalysis was carried out assuming dominant and recessive models; this grouping method has been widely used in the majority of meta-analyses [ 31 ] and the individual studies [ 4 ]. The groups for SNP 87 were T allele versus C allele, TT versus   $\mathrm{TC+CC}$  , and   $\mathrm{TT+TC}$   versus CC; the groups for SNP 83 were C allele versus T allele, CC versus   $\mathrm{CT+TT},$  , and  $\mathrm{CC+CT}$   versus TT.  

Among the seven studies, two studies [ 10 ,  23 ] reported ischemic stroke without further subtype classification, and three studies [ 20 ,  21 ,  25 ] reported stroke subtype information, but used inconsistent classification criteria. For example, Sun defined the stroke subtype according to the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria, but included car dio geni c stroke [ 20 ]. However, Xue [ 21 ] and  $\mathrm{Xu}$   [ 25 ] excluded embolic brain infarction from data collection. In addition, data from Tomonaga were restricted to a the roth rom bot ic infarction [ 4 ]. Because of this difference in subtype classification, this study was not used in subtype analysis.  

Results of meta-analyses  

The fixed effects model was used for analysis of SNP 83 CC versus   $\mathrm{CT+TT},$  , and all three analyses of SNP 87.  $P$   values of these four analyses were all greater than 0.05 for heterogeneity using the    $\chi^{2}$    test. The random effects model

 1.42;   $95\%$   CI, 1.14 – 1.77) (Figs.  1  and  2 ), whereas SNP 83

  $\mathrm{CC+CT}$   genotype (OR, 1.20;   $95\%$   CI, 0.97 – 1.47) failed to show a statistically significant association. No statistically significant associations with ischemic infarction were identified for the SNP 87 T allele (OR, 1.00;   $95\%$   CI, 0.91 – 1.11), TT genotype (OR, 1.17;   $95\%$   CI, 0.88 – 1.57), or the   $\mathrm{TT+TC}$   genotype (OR, 0.98;  $95\%$   CI, 0.87 – 1.10).  

Evaluation of publication bias  

The fail-safe number   $(N_{\mathrm{fs}})$   was calculated for each metaanalysis of SNP 83 and SNP 87 to assess publication bias. The  $N_{\mathrm{fs}}~0.05$   for SNP   $83\mathrm{~C~}$   allele, CC genotype, and   $\mathrm{CC^{+}}$  CT genotype were 40, 17, and 15, respectively, which were larger than the numbers of studies included in each analysis, and the  $N_{\mathrm{fs}}\,0.05$   for SNP 87 T allele, TT genotype, and   $\mathrm{TT+TC}$   genotype were all negative, suggesting no significant publication bias for SNP 83, but a possibility for publication bias in the analysis of SNP 87.  

# Discussion  

In our meta-analyses, SNP 83 was associated with an increased risk of ischemic infarction among Asian individuals. The association between SNP 87 and ischemic stroke was not confirmed, and we did not find evidence for he ter oz y gos it y of SNP 45 and SNP 41 in Asian populations.  

PDE4D encodes cAMP-specific 30, 50-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D, a member of the ph os ph odi est erase superfamily (PDE4 family), which is expressed in most cell types involved in the pathogen es is of atherosclerosis [ 32 ].

PDE4D selectively degrades the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is a key signaling molecule mediating cell proliferation, migration, and secretion related to atherosclerosis [ 33 ,  34 ]. An association between PDE4D and stroke risk was demonstrated among patients with hypertension who subsequently suffered from small vessel infarction [ 12 ] and among young adults with a very low prevalence of at hero sclerotic disease [ 18 ], suggesting a mechanism other than accelerated atherosclerosis for the involvement of PDE4D in stroke risk. It has been reported that cAMP is responsible for neuron survival and neuro genesis [ 35 ,  36 ], and a selective PDE4 inhibitor significantly increases the survival of nascent neurons and decreases newborn cell death after ischemia [ 37 ]. Thus genetic variants of PDE4D may alter neuronal properties through the PDE4D/cAMP pathway to render neurons susceptible to permanent damage from a pre-ischemic insult [ 20 ].  

SNP 83, SNP 87, SNP 45, and SNP 41, which are located at the   $5^{\prime}$   end of PDE4D and are involved in transcription, splicing, message stability, or message transport of one or more isoforms, were considered to be the strongest markers in the initial study on Iceland people [ 1 ]. SNP 83 was associated with carotid stroke, and SNP 45, SNP 41, and SNP 87 were associated with combined car dio geni c and carotid stroke [ 1 ]. In this study, SNP 45 or SNP 41 could not be considered as biomarkers for ischemic stroke in the Asian populations, because all subjects were homozygous for the risk alleles. Given that the association between PDE4D and ischemic infarction was confirmed for allele C and allele C homozygotes of SNP 83 but not in the carriers, the association between allele C and stroke may be not a typical dominant model. Given the bigger OR compared with that of allele C, the presence of the SNP  $83\;\mathrm{CC}$   genotype has stronger power to indicate that PDE4D is associated with increased risk of ischemic infarction of Asians.  

In a recent meta-analysis by Bevan [ 31 ] of 16 individual studies, 14 of which targeted white populations and the other two were conducted in Japan and Pakistan, the haplotype G0 showed a significant association with increased risk of ischemic stroke in white populations (OR, 1.18;   $95\%$   CI, 1.05 – 1.33;    $P{=}0.007]$  ). However, the association of ischemic stroke with allele 0 of AC008818 was not significant in this meta-analysis (OR, 1.11;   $95\%$  CI, 1.00 – 1.24;    $P{=}0.06$  ); no individual SNP was associated with ischemic stroke. We did not evaluate allele 0 of AC008818 or haplotype G0 carriers in the present study because the individual studies on those two gene variants were insufficient (Table  2 ); however, we determined SNP  $83\,\mathrm{~C~}$   to be a risk allele, and SNP 83 CC genotype was significantly associated with ischemic infarction in the Asian population. In Asians, especially Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Pakistani people, this association was a little stronger; the OR associated with SNP 83 in our study (OR, 1.42) was larger than that determined for allele 0 of

AC008818 (OR, 1.18) or haplotype G0 carriers (OR, 1.11) in Bevan ’ s study when taking only white subjects into consideration [ 31 ]. However, the conclusion of Bevan's report was negative for a significant association between PDE4D and ischemic stroke in white populations which primarily due to the exclusion of Greta rs do ttir's initial study (Ac008818-1 allele 0 OR, 1.04;   $95\%$   CI, 0.91 – 1.18;  $P$   value, 0.60; G0 haplotype OR, 1.16;   $95\%$   CI,   $1.00-$  1.34;    $P$   value, 0.06). We should be cautious when interpreting this negative conclusion, because of the questionable statistical decision for excluding the original paper when over viewing the association between PDE4D and white populations other than targeting replication exclusively. Even if only taking replication into consideration, the small p value for G0 haplotype (  $P$   value:0.06) still indicated strong tendency and the limited number of studies included (only three after excluding the initial study) added to uncertainty. Therefore, it might be too early to exclude a link between PDE4D and ischemic stroke in white populations, and the possibility that both in Asian population and European population PDE4D confers the risk of ischemic stroke could not be excluded either. Strictly speaking, new studies with large samples targeting white populations are needed before we are able to identify similarities or differences in the association between PDE4D and ischemic stroke in Asian and European populations.  

Rigorous selection criteria (studies requiring neuroimaging data and Asian subjects only) enriched the meta-analyses for studies with comparable selection of participants. We avoided lack of specificity by excluding individuals with hemorrhagic stroke, TIA, or patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke lacking neuro imaging evidence. Further, SNPs were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP) in the majority of the studies included. Therefore, methodological consistency was maintained across the included studies.  

However, there are several limitations in this work. For example, most of the replication studies on Asian populations investigated fewer variants than studies targeting white populations, which may reduce the number of positively associated variants of PDE4D. In addition, we did not perform specific stroke subtype analysis because the  

![](images/7afcf892a7bdb802f939c26377bdef5bfdc2ff32294590362c82003a8f93075e.jpg)  

studies did not include a sufficient degree of stroke subtyping or consistent criteria for classifying ischemic stroke. Further, we did not have adequate data to analyze each Asian ethnicity individually rather than combining Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Pakistani subjects as a single Asian population for each meta-analysis. Although this was a limitation in a genetic study, the present study provided a better understanding of the association between PDE4D and the risk of ischemic infarction in Asian people for the first time. Another important consideration for our study is that of heterogeneity between studies as a result of publication bias and small sample size. Because publication bias tends to exaggerate rather than minimize associations [ 31 ], we have sufficient reason to exclude SNP 87 from the PDE4D biomarkers for ischemic infarction in Asian populations.  

In summary, the present study found that PDE4D was associated with ischemic infarction in Asian people, and identified SNP 83 as an important biomarker.
