# Abstract  

High temperature requirement protein A1 ( HtrA 1) was identified as the causative gene of autosomal  recessive arte rio path y and associated with lacunar ischemic stroke (IS) in European. This study aimed at  evaluating the association of  HTRA1  with IS and four tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  were genotyped in a cohort of 4,098 Chinese. The mRNA level of  HTRA1  in 72 IS cases and 72  hypertension controls were measured and compared. In whole population, SNP rs2268350   $(\mathsf{C}^{>\mathsf{T}})$   was  significantly associated with IS incidence   $(P{=}0.034)$  . Stratification analysis observed significant association  of rs2268350 in male, smoking and drinking populations, rs2672587   $(\mathbb{C}^{>}\mathbb{G})$   in smoking and nonsmoking  populations and rs3793917   $(\mathbb{C}^{>}\mathbb{G})$   in smoking, nonsmoking and non drinking populations with stroke  respectively   $(P{<}0.05)$  . The additive interaction and multiplicative interaction between rs2268350 and  smoking were both of significant   $(\mathsf{P}\!<\!0.05)$   after adjustment for the covariates. There was a cumulated risk  of IS among genotypes of rs3793917   $(P{=}0.009)$   and rs2672587   $(P{=}0.047)$   in smoking population. The  mRNA level of  HTRA1  in non-smokers with rs2268350 CC was significantly higher than smokers with  rs2268350 CT/TT   $(\mathsf{P{=}0.046})$   in IS cases. Our findings support that  HTRA1  confers the genetic  susceptibility to IS and smoking might modify the genetic effect of  HTRA1  on IS by suppressing  HTRA1   mRNA expression.

# Introduction  

The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD  2016) has pointed out that 5.53 million people had  different types of strokes worldwide in 2016 [1].  

Stroke has become the second cause of death and  major cause of disability in the world [2] while it’s the  leading cause of death in China [3]. In China, the  remarkably increased number of ischemic stroke (IS)  has resulted in 301 million disability-adjusted  life-years [4].  

Stroke  including  either  ischemic  or  hae mor rha gic stroke and about  $80\%$   of all strokes are  ischemic [5]. The predisposing risk factors for stroke  include hypertension (HTN), dys lipid emi a, impaired  glucose metabolism, metabolic obesity, smoking, lack  of exercise and a family history of stroke [6, 7]. In the  path o physiology of IS, the hazards of smoking on the  risk of IS may partly be explained by changes in the  venules [8], particularly, wider retinal venular caliber  [9]. The number of cigarettes smoked daily show a  strong dose-response relationship to the incidence of  IS among young men [10], as well as, exposure to  second-hand smoke can also significantly increase the  risk of stroke [11].  

The HtrA serine protease 1 ( HTRA1 ) was the first  one of the serine proteases family to be found [12, 13].  HTRA1  represents diverse biological functions of  vascular smooth muscle cell including growth,  proliferation, migration, and apoptosis [14, 15].  HTRA1  inhibits transforming growth factor $\cdot\upbeta$   (TGF $\upbeta$  )  signal transduction by binding TGF $\cdot\upbeta1$  , TGF $\cdot\upbeta2,$  ,  BMP2, BMP4, activin and Gdf5, thus inducing  vascular changes [16-18]. In addition,  HTRA1 -  mediated  pro teo lysis  has  been  implicated  in  carcinogen es is [19], age-related macular degeneration  (AMD)  [20]  and  familial  ischemic  cerebral  small-vessel  disease  [21].  The  HTRA1 -smoking  additive effect was observed on AMD [22] and thus,  the interaction between  HTRA1  and smoking on  cerebro vascular diseases is very noteworthy.  

Hara et al have indicated that  HtrA1  is the  causative gene of Cerebral autosomal recessive  arte rio path y  with  sub cortical  infarcts  and  leuk o encephalopathy (CARASIL), a genetic cause of  stroke in the young [21]. Recently, two rare  monogenic variants were identified by target gene  sequencing for younger onset lacunar stroke [23].  Patients with CARASIL are characterized by ischemic,  non-hypertensive with associated alopecia and  s pond y los is  [24-26].  A  recent  genome-wide  association study (GWAS) [27] suggested that a single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs79043147 in  HTRA1  was associated with lacunar IS in individuals  of European ancestry. However, the minor allele  frequency (MAF) of SNP rs79043147   $(\mathrm{C>T})$   is zero in  Chinese population. Herein, it is necessary to evaluate  whether  HTRA1  harbor susceptible loci for IS in  Chinese population.  

This study focuses on the association of four  tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) at  HTRA1  with the incidence  of IS in a cohort study of Chinese Han population and  a population-based mRNA levels analysis which  would help us well understand the effect of  HTRA1 on IS.  

# Method  

# Study participants  

A cluster sampling method was used to survey  4,128 subjects in 2009, Yixing city and 4,098  individuals without stroke were further followed up  from 2014 to 2017. In addition, the mRNA was  isolated from peripheral blood mono nuclear cells  (PBMCs) and compared between 72 IS patients from  People's Hospital of Yixing City and age- (  $(\pm2$   years)  and gender-matched 72 HTN controls from a  community survey. IS cases included in mRNA  analysis were diagnosed by CT and/or MRI  examination that showed presence of infarction and  categorized according to ICD-10 I60-I69.  

gender, the habits of smoking and drinking and  history of disease. The individuals who smoked more  than 20 cigarettes per week for at least 3 months per  year were defined as smokers. Drinking referred to  the habit of currently or previously consuming  alcoholic beverages more than 1 time per week for  more than 5 months per year. Furthermore, weight   $(\mathrm{kg})$   and height (cm) were measured twice and the  blood pressure level was averaged by the three times  measurements [28].  

All the subjects approved to donate   $5\;\mathrm{{ml}}$  venous  blood. The serum glucose (GLU), total cholesterol  (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were measured.  

During the follow-up study, face to face  interview and telephone interview were conducted to  determine participants’ disease incidence and vital  data. The incident events were confirmed by the  registered disease and verbal autopsy from the local  public health authority (ICD-10 I60-I69) and IS events  were finally determined by the study-wide endpoint  assessment committee.  

The study protocol was approved by the ethics  committee of Nanjing Medical University (200803307,  2015077) and each participant signed a written  informed consent.  

# SNP Selection  

In the Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB), China, we  searched all 84 SNPs with MAF over 0.05 covered  HTRA1  gene with the addition of  $2\,\mathrm{k}\mathrm{b}$   upstream and 1  kb downstream to screen susceptible SNPs for IS. The  tagSNPs were selected according to the criterion of  linkage d is equilibrium (LD)  $\scriptstyle r^{2}\geq0.8,$  , with the data from  SNPinfo Web Server (http://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/).  Finally, from 11 tagSNPs clusters and 16 single SNPs,  we selected four tagSNPs in  HTRA1 , rs2268350   $(\mathrm{C>T})$  ,  rs2672587   $_{(C>G)}$  , rs3793917   $_{(C>G)}$   and rs12413729 

  $\scriptstyle(G>A)$    with  predicted  biological  function 

 (Supplementary Table S1) that could tag 38 SNPs.  

# DNA isolating and SNP genotyping  

A standard phenol–chloroform method was  used to isolate the genomic DNA. The polymerase  chain reaction (PCR)-TaqMan MGB probe array was  performed to amplify all four tagSNPs of  HTRA1  by  GeneAmp  $\textcircled{8}$   PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems,  USA) thermal cycler and then read on the ABI 7900  system (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA). All the  successful call rates of the four tagSNPs were over   $99.79\ \%$  .  

The trained staff conducted a questionnaire  survey to collect demographic data including age,

# RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR detection  

After fasting over 12 hours, EDTA-containing  blood samples of IS case were collected within 24  hours after admission in hospital and the samples of  control  were  collected  during  the  survey.  Anticoagulant samples were immediately mixed with  blood preservation solution (Eaglink Cat#EGEN2026,  NANJING YIN I NGFU SHENG Biotech. Co., Ltd.  Nanjing, China) by 1:3. The total RNA in PBMCs was  isolated from   $800~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   mixture using RNA Blood Kit  (Cat#Yu-B02-1, Yuan Corp., Wuxi, China). cDNA was  synthesized from mRNA using TAKARA reverse  transcription kits (RR047A Takara Prime Script RT  reagent Kit with   $\mathrm{\mathbf{g}D N A}$   Eraser, Japan). The RT-PCR  reactions were performed by ABI RT-PCR 7900. Each  sample was prepared with three parallel samples and  quality control requires that the standard deviation of  cycle threshold (CT) among repeated samples is less  than  0.5.  The  housekeeper  gene  of  Gly cer aldehyde-3-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (GAPDH) was used as reference gene for internal  control. The mRNA relative expression is calculated  by 2 -∆∆CT  (∆∆CT case  $=\Delta C\mathrm{T}$   case -  $\Delta C\mathrm{T}$   control average  value, ∆∆CT control   $=\ \Delta C\mathrm{T}$   control - ∆CT control  average value,   $\Delta\mathrm{CT}~=~\mathrm{CT}$   of target gene - CT of  housekeeper gene). All the reverse transcription and  RT-PCR reactions as well as conditions are described  at  the  Supplementary  Information  Reverse  transcription reactions and conditions and RT-PCR  reactions and conditions.  

# Statistical analysis  

The questionnaire data was input by EpiData  3.0 software, IBM-SPSS 20.0was used for the statistical  analysis. Cox regression model was used to estimate  the association with hazard ratios (HRs) and   $95\%$  confidence interval (CI). Mann–Whitney U test was  applied to compare the mRNA levels with abnormal  distribution between IS cases and controls. Statistical  significance was defined as a two-tailed    $P$  value less  than 0.05. False discovery rate (FDR) method  performed on R-software (V4.01) was used to correct  multiple  comparison  [29].  Moreover,  additive  interaction was estimated by relative excess risk  owing to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion  (AP) owing to interaction and synergy index (S). An  Excel sheet was used to calculate the additive  interaction  and  their  confidence  intervals  (www.epinet.se).  

# Results  

# Demographic and clinical characteristics of  study population  

The participants’ demographic and clinical  characteristics are listed in Table 1. During the 5.01  years median follow-up period, a total of 187 IS were  finally observed by disease register and report system  with  an  incidence  density  of 88.49  per   $10^{4}$    person-years. Among the 187 IS, 12 IS   $(6.4\%)$   were less  than 55 years old and 175 IS   $(93.6\%)$   were older than  55 years old. In addition, these 187 IS subjects consist  of 94 men   $(50.3\%)$   and 92 women   $(49.7\%)$  .  

# Association analyses of  HTRA1  and IS  incidence  

Cox regression analysis showed that the  rs2268350   $(\mathrm{C>T})$   TT genotype carriers had an  increased risk of IS than CC and CT genotype carriers  with a marginal   $P$   value of   $0.078,$  , the adjusted HR 

  $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   was 1.499 (1.030-2.181) and   $P$   value as 0.034 

 (Supplementary Table S2). Further stratification  analysis revealed that in the male and smoking  populations, the adjusted HRs   $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   were 2.057 

 (1.240-3.411) and 2.933 (1.464-5.875) with   $P$   values of 

 0.005 and 0.002 respectively. In smoking populations,  the FDR-adjusted   $P$   value was 0.048. In drinking  population,  the  genetic  variants  of  rs2268350  presented an additive effect on the risk of IS and the  HR   $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   after adjustment was 1.855 (1.119-3.074)  and   $P$    value was 0.017 (Table 2).  

Moreover, in the non-smoking population, the  rs2672587   $_{C>G}$   variation was significantly associated  with the increased risk of IS after adjustment for  covariates, and HR   $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   of additive model was  1.662 (1.076-2.569),   $P~=~0.022$  . While in smoking  population, the variants of rs2672587 presented an  additive effect on the decreased risk of IS and the  adjusted HR   $(95\%C I)$   was 0.631 (0.405-0.985) with   $P$  value of 0.043 (Table 2).

Drinking stratification adjusted for age, gender, TCH, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, BMI, smoking, HTN and T2DM.  

In the non-smoking population, rs3793917  CG/GG carriers had an increased risk of IS than CC  carriers, the adjusted HR   $(95\%C I)$   was 2.080 

 (1.366-3.167),  $P=0.001$  . The FDR-adjusted  $P$   value was 

 0.048. While in the smoking population, the variants  of rs3793917 presented a significant additive effect on  the decreased risk of IS, the adjusted HRs   $(95\%C l s)$  were 0.452 (0.244-0.837) with   $P$   value of 0.004 (Table  2). The association of rs3793917 (CG/GG vs. CC) with  IS was also significant in non-drinking population  [adjusted HR   $(95\%~\mathrm{CI})=\!1.647$   (1.120-2.420),   $P{=}0.011]$  whereas not significant in drinking population  (Supplementary Table S3).  

# Interaction analysis  

Additive interaction analysis showed that  additive interaction between  HTRA1  rs2268350 and  smoking was statistically significant, after adjustment  for age, gender, TC, TG, HDL, LDL, drinking, BMI,  T2DM and HTN. The RERI, AP and S values   $(95\%$  CIs) were 0.271 (-0.071-0.613), 0.169 (0.030-0.308), 

 1.805 (1.009-3.229) and   $P$   values were 0.120, 0.017 and 

 0.047 respectively (Table 3). All the data of other  interaction analysis were listed in Supplementary  Table S4.  

Furthermore,  the  multiplicative  interaction  rs2268350 and smoking was also verified to be  significant and adjusted HR   $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   was 1.179  (1.013-1.372) with   $P$   of 0.033 after adjustment for  covariates.  

#  Modification effect analysis  

For the rs2268350 CC genotype carriers, drinkers  had a decreased risk of ischemic stroke than  non-drinkers, the HR   $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   was 0.285 (0.110-0.734)  and   $P$   value was 0.009, after adjustment for age,  gender, TC, TG, HDL,  $\mathrm{LDA},$   smoking, BMI, T2DM and  HTN. The  $P$   value of heterogeneity test was 0.005 after  adjustments for covariates. For the rs2268350 TT  genotype, females had an increased risk of ischemic  stroke than males after adjustment for other  confounding factors, the adjusted HR   $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   was  0.379 (0.144-0.998) and  $P$   value was 0.049.  

According to those who carried CC genotype of  rs3793917, smokers had an increased risk of ischemic  stroke than CG and GG genotype carriers after  adjustment for the other confounding factors, the  adjusted HR   $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   was 7.503 (2.624-21.457) and   $P$    value was   $0.171{\times}10^{-3}$  . The   $P$   value for heterogeneity  test was less than 0.001 after adjustments for  covariates among smokers carrying CC, CG and GG  genotypes of rs3793917 (Table 3).  

As for carriers with GG genotype of rs2672587,  smokers had an increased risk of ischemic stroke than  CC and CG genotype carriers, after adjustment for the  remaining confounding factors, the adjusted HR   $(95\%\mathrm{CI})$   was 4.821 (1.526-15.229) with  $P$   value of 0.007.  The   $P$   value for heterogeneity test was 0.017 after  adjustments for covariates among smokers carrying  CC, CG and GG genotypes of rs2672587 (Table 4).

# mRNA expression levels comparing between  IS cases and controls  

The demographic and clinical characteristics for  the case-control study of ischemic stroke were listed  in Supplementary Table S5. The mRNA expression  levels   $(2^{\scriptscriptstyle-\Delta\Delta C T})$   were 1.344 (0.759, 2.452) and 1.112  (0.439, 2.379) in IS cases and controls respectively  while no statistical significance was detected (Figure  S1),  $Z{=}0.944$  ,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.345$  .  

In the whole sample of IS cases and controls,  smokers had a relative lower  HTRA1  mRNA levels of  0.966 (0.451, 1.805) compared with non-smokers 1.402 

 (0.609, 2.498) and the   $P$    value was 0.049. Whereas,  there was not the similar difference in IS cases or  controls separately.  

A significant difference of the mRNA expression  levels (2 -∆∆CT ) was found between CC [1.590 (0.945,  2.481)] and CT/TT [0.997 (0.375, 1.982)] genotypes of  rs2268350 in IS cases with   $P$   value of 0.044 but not in  controls   $_{(P>0.05)}$  . In addition, the mRNA level (2 -∆∆CT )  of HTRA1 in non-smokers with rs2268350 CC [1.647  (1.137, 2.493)] was significantly higher than smokers  with rs2268350 CT/TT [0.686 (0.160, 1.676)]   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.046})$    in IS cases (Figure 1). All the mRNA levels (2 -∆∆CT ) of  different genotypes for each tagSNPs were listed in  Supplementary Table S6.

# Discussion  

In this prospective cohort study of Chinese  population, we verified the association of  HtrA1  and  IS and identified significant interaction of rs2268350   $(\mathrm{C}\!>\!\mathrm{T})$   and smoking as well as differential mRNA  expression level in PBMCs in IS cases and HTN  controls.  Notably,  both  the  additive  and  multiplicative interaction between  HTRA1  rs2268350  and smoking were to be found statistically significant,  and the interaction might induce the development of  IS probably through suppressing the  HTRA1  mRNA  expression in PBMCs. In addition, smoking devotes a  two-fold increased risk of rs2672587 and rs3793917 CC  genotypes on IS and even more after adjustment for  covariates. These findings would further deepen our  understanding of the role of gene-environmental  interaction in the molecular mechanism of IS.  

Cigarette smoke, which contains numerous  potential oxidants is associated with the increased  blood pressure level and cardiovascular disease  mortality [30]. Vitro and in vivo studies indicated that  the cigarette smoke components exerted their  deleterious effects on DNA adducts via cytochrome  P-450  (CYP)-dependent  bio activation  [31]  and  inducing oxidative stress [32] and inflammation [33].  China now consumes about   $40\%$   of the world's total  cigarettes consumption, especially in men [34].  Previous study has suggested that smoking could  strengthen the  HTRA1  additive effect on AMD [22].  Similar macular degeneration and cell apoptosis were  also observed in patients with neo vascular type  (nAMD) [35], as well as stroke [36] and myocardial  infarction (MI) [37]. Cigarette smoking also could  modify the genetic effect of LOC387715 rs 110490924  on polypoidal choroidal vas cul opa thy [38]. In  addition, previous cohort study showed that the  nAMD significantly increased the risk of stroke 

  $(\mathrm{HR}{=}1.3)$  ),  particularly  hemorrhagic  stroke 

  $(\mathrm{HR}{=}1.70)$  )[39].   These  findings  would  help  to  understand the molecular mechanisms how smoking  affect stroke and promote tobacco control strategy in  preventing the onset of stroke.  

For CARASIL, the pathogenic mutations of  HTRA1  were suggested to impair the regulatory  function of HTRA1 and thus directly increase the level  of TGF $\cdot\upbeta1$   in cerebral small arteries [21]. Accordingly,  as a downstream effector of the TGF $\cdot\upbeta1$   signaling  cascade in brain tissue, the phosphor y late d SMAD  protein expression levels significantly increased [18].  HTRA1  gene also regulates scar formation in the  pathogen es is of scars through the activation of latent  TGF $\cdot\upbeta1$   in keloid fi br oblasts [40]. All these evidences  suggest that  HTRA1  participates in the pathogen es is  of stroke by regulating ang io genesis via TGF $\cdot\upbeta$    signaling.  

Our most notable findings illustrated that the  additive and multiplicative interactions between  smoking and  HTRA1  rs2268350 were both statistically  significant on the incidence of IS. Furthermore, among  carriers with CC genotype for rs3793917 and  rs2672587, smokers always showed a higher risk of IS  than non-smokers. Both smoking and the risk allele T  of  HTRA1  rs2268350 could suppress the  HTRA1   mRNA expression. Therefore, smoking and the  affective allele of  HTRA1  together could be applied to  forecast the risk of stroke. The further replication of  this interaction would be warranted in other  follow-up populations.  

The main advantages of this study are that we  firstly verified the association of  HtrA1  with IS and  the interactions between smoking and  HTRA1   polymorphisms in a cohort study in Chinese  population. Particularly, the results of differential  HTRA1  mRNA  expression  further  provided  functional evidence of transcriptional level. This  study also has the following limitations: firstly, we  just selected and tested four tagSNPs of  HtrA1  with  MAF over 0.05 and that might miss some rare SNP as  well as the biological effect might be presented by  closely linked loci nearby. Secondly, we evaluated the  interaction of smoking status at baseline and  HtrA1  genetic variations, whereas we didn’t check the  change of smoking exposure during follow-up and  this will prevent us from doing more accurate analysis  instead of conventional analytical methods for cohort  study. Lastly, although we adjusted the traditional  con founders, the findings of this study warrant to be  further validated by other studies refraining from  potential selection bias.  

In conclusion, the findings of this study support  that HTRA1 harbor genetic variations that contribute  to the susceptibility of IS in Chinese Han population  and the population-based evidence of  HTRA1 rs2268350 variations interacting with smoking, and  HTRA1  mRNA differential ly expressing among  smoking status and rs2268350 genotypes in the  patients with IS suggest that smoking modifies the  genetic effect of  HTRA1  on IS. Further investigation  would be recommended into the exact mechanism of  relevant gene-environment interaction.
