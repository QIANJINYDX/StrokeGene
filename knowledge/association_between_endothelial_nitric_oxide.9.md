# Abstract:  

Previously published studies that have examined whether the three polymorphisms,  G894T ,  T786C , and  4b/a   in the endo the li al nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene, are associated with ischemic stroke (IS) have reported  conflicting results. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the potential association between these  three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the  eNOS  gene and IS risk. A literature search was carried  out for eligible candidate gene studies published before August 05, 2015 in the PubMed, Embase, and Google  Scholar databases. The following combinations of main keywords were used in our study: (‘endo the li al nitric  oxide synthase’) or (‘ eNOS ’) and (‘G894T,  $4{\sf b}/a$  , and T786C’) and (‘polymorphism’) or (‘polymorphisms’) and  (‘Ischemic Stroke’ or ‘IS’) and (‘Cerebral Infarction’ or   $^\circ{\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{I}}^{\prime}$  ) and (‘genetic polymorphism’ or ‘single nucleotide  polymorphisms’ or ‘SNP’). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by  using fixed or random effects model. Meta-regression analysis was used to investigate the potential sources of  heterogeneity. Begg’s funnel plots were used to explore the publication bias, and heterogeneity was assessed  by I2 test. Twenty seven case-control studies involving 6733 cases and 7305 controls were analyzed in our  meta-analysis. Significant association was observed for  G894T  (  ${\mathsf{O R}}=1.21$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 1.03 to  $1.41$  ;  $\mathsf{P}=0.019$  )  and  $4b/a$     $\mathsf{\Delta T R e t}=1.65$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 1.01 to 2.72;  $\mathsf{P}=0.04$  ) whereas a non-significant association was observed for  T786C  (  ${\sf O R}=1.11$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 0.98 to 1.26;  $\mathsf{P=}0.109,$  )  eNOS  gene polymorphisms and IS. Our meta-analysis  establishes that the  G894T  and  $4{\sf b}/a$   polymorphisms of  eNOS  gene are significantly associated with the risk  of IS. However, a non-significant association was found between  T786C  polymorphism of the  eNOS  gene  and IS risk. Further prospective large epidemiological studies need to be done to confirm these findings.

E-mail: amits52003  $@$  gmail.com S troke is the second major leading cause of  death and adult disability after ischemic heart  disease (IHD).  Stroke accounts for nearly 5.7  million deaths globally, and  $87\%$   of these deaths  occurr in low and middle income nations.  The  incidence of stroke in South Asian countries  has increased by more than   $100\%$  , while this  has decreased by   $42\%$   in developed European  countries in the last four decades.  Stroke is  a multi‑factorial disease; epidemiological and  animal studies have strongly recommended the  role of genetic influence in the pathogen es is of  ischemic stroke (IS).  The genetic influences are  probably polygenic, and IS itself has a number  

of different subtypes, which may each have  different pathogen es is.  This increase in the  incidence of stroke in developing countries could  have been influenced by both environmental and  genetic factors.  

In addition to genetic variants, non‑genetic  variants including environmental and lifestyle  risk factors may also contribute to the risk of  developing complex diseases such as stroke.  Lifestyle risk factors such as diet, exercise,  smoking, and alcohol consumption can play  a large role in determining whether or not  someone develops a disease. Family history is  also an important tool for determining the risk of developing  stroke. The genetic and non‑genetic factors help us to  identify the risk factors that can take control over the risk  of stroke.  

The  eNOS  gene is located on chromosome 7 (7q35‑q36) and  consists of 26 exons. It codes for an enzyme that generates nitric  oxide (NO) in the vascular endothelium. NO mediates va so dilation  in the endothelium, inhibits adhesion of platelets and leukocytes  and limits oxidation of a the rogen ic low‑density lipoprotein s in  the vascular endothelium. Impaired endothelium‑dependent  va so dilation is a common feature of at hero sclerotic vessels,  which appears to be partly due to the reduction in the activity  of vascular endo the li al nitric oxide synthase. Impaired nitric  oxide‑dependent vasomotor reactivity has been implicated in  the path o physiology of stroke.  Because it has an important role  in the physiology of the vas cula ture, genetic variations could  alter the expression and activity of  eNOS , thereby contributing  to the development of stroke. A meta‑analysis  published in  2009 suggested that TT genotype of  G894T  polymorphism is not  associated with the risk of IS. Studies published in the literature  examining the association between  eNOS  polymorphism and IS  have shown conflicting results. Discrepancy in the methodological  quality of studies may explain the presence of the conflicting  results. No meta‑analysis till date has explored the association  of methodological quality and outcome. Large epidemiological  studies have been performed explaining the relationship of the  eNOS  gene polymorphisms (G894T, T786C, 4b/a) and the risk of  IS; however, the results are still controversial and not conclusive.  Because a single study neither has a large number of sample size  nor has the power to draw profound conclusions, carrying out  a meta‑analysis seemed to be an appropriate approach in order  to get solid conclusive results. Therefore, the aim of this study  was to perform an updated meta‑analysis of the association  between  eNOS  gene polymorphisms and the risk of IS, as well  as to investigate whether or not the methodological quality of  study affects the results.  

# Materials and Methods  

A literature search was carried out for eligible candidate gene  studies published till August 05, 2015 using the PubMed, Embase,  and Google Scholar databases. The following combinations of  main keywords were used in our study: (‘endo the li al nitric  oxide synthase’) or (‘ eNOS’ ) and (‘G894T, 4b/a, and T786C’)  and (‘polymorphism’) or (‘polymorphisms’) and (‘ischemic  stroke’ or ‘IS’) and (‘cerebral infarction’ or   $'C I'$  ) and (‘genetic  polymorphism’ or ‘single nucleotide polymorphisms’ or  ‘SNP’). The search was performed without any boundary  on language; however, we selected only those studies that  were conducted on human adult subjects. In order to identify  additionally published articles, all references were reviewed  carefully. Pooled odds ratios  (ORs) and   $95\%$   confidence  intervals  (CIs) were estimated by using fixed or random  effects model. Meta‑analysis was carried out using STATA,  version 13.0 (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release  13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).  

# Inclusion and exclusion criteria  

For inclusion in the meta‑analysis, the following criteria were  set: (1) A case‑control study investigating the association  between  G894T  in exon 7 or   $4b/a$   in intron 4 or  T786C  (in the  promoter region) genetic polymorphisms of the  eNOS  gene  and susceptibility to IS;  (2) cases meeting the diagnostic  criteria for IS; (3) studies reporting a sufficient genotypic  frequency for data required for meta‑analysis. The major  reasons for excluding studies were: (1) Not a case‑control  study; (2) duplicate publications were present with overlapping  subjects from the same study; and, (3) no available data was  reported. This meta‑analysis was conducted in accordance  with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta‑analyses (PRISMA) guideline.

IS: ischemic stroke; CT: computed tomography; MRI: magnetic resonance  imaging; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RFLP: Restriction fragment length  polymorphism;QVSS: Questionnaire for verifying stroke-free status; HWE:  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  

# Data extraction  

As per the PRISMA guidelines, each full‑text article was checked  for eligibility by two authors (AK and SM) independently and  the following data was extracted from the eligible studies: First  author surname, publication year, country, number of cases and  controls, population, genotyping method, age, sex, genotype  frequency, etc., Disagreements were resolved by discussion  among all the authors until a consensus was obtained.  

# Quality assessment  

We also examined the methodological quality of every study  which was included in our meta‑analysis using a quality  assessment scale developed for genetic association studies,   which was modified by us to increase the relevance of our  study. Both the traditional epidemiological considerations  and genetic issues were taken into consideration by using  this scale. The scores ranged from 0 (worst) to 17 (best). The  contents of the quality scale are illustrated in Table 1. The  quality of this study was independently assessed by two  authors (AK and SM). Inconsistency over the quality scores  were resolved by discussion among all the authors and a  subsequent agreement was reached.  

# Statistical analysis  

Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium  (HWE) was tested for  genotype distributions in the controls by using the chi‑square  test. The association between   $G894T$   or   $T786C$   or   $4b/a$    genetic  polymorphisms of  eNOS  gene and susceptibility to IS  was assessed by the pooled ORs with their corresponding  $95\%$    confidence intervals   $(95\%$   CIs) under three genetic models,  consisting of dominant, recessive, and allelic models. After  considering the possible heterogeneity between studies, a  statistical test was conducted for heterogeneity by using  Cochran’s Q statistic and I 2  metric.  In our study, the  $\mathrm{I}^{2}$   values  exceeding  $50\%$   and heterogeneity at the  $10\%$   level of significance  were considered to be indicators of significant heterogeneity.  Begg’s funnel plot was used to assess the potential for a  publication bias. Stratified analyses were done according to two  major ethnic groups/populations. Meta‑regression analysis  was done to check if the methodological quality of studies was  significantly associated with the size of the observed effect.  

# Results  

A total of 59 published articles were identified by using the  pre‑specified search strategy. Figure 1 displays the study flow  chart. Out of the 59 articles which were retrieved, 19 studies  were excluded due to their irrelevance to our interest, and 5  studies were excluded because they were in duplicate records.  As per the inclusion criteria, 27 case‑control studies were  included in our meta‑analysis. Sixteen studies were in the  Asian population, whereas 11 studies were in the Caucasian  population. The publication years of the studies included in  this meta‑analysis ranged from 1998 to 2014. Twenty four  studies in this meta‑analysis had controls in accordance with  Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The quality score of all

# Association between  G894T  polymorphism of  eNOS  gene  and ischemic stroke  

The  eNOS G894T  gene polymorphism was assessed in  19 case‑control studies with a total of 4505 IS cases and 5038  controls. Borderline significant association was observed for  G894T polymorphism of  eNOS  gene and IS under dominant   $[\mathrm{GT}+\mathrm{TT}$  vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.22$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 0.99 to  $1.50,$  ;  $P=0.06]$   and allelic [T vs  G:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.23$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 0.95 to 1.59;    $P<0.12]$  ] models. Significant  association was observed for  G894T  polymorphism of  eNOS gene and IS under recessive model [TT vs  $\mathrm{GT}+\mathrm{CG}.$  :  $\mathrm{OR}=1.21$  ;   $95\%$   CI: 1.03 to 1.41;    $P\,=\,0.019]$  ]. In the subgroup analysis  based on ethnicity, significant association between  G894T polymorphism of  eNOS  gene and risk of IS was observed in 9  Asian studies under dominant   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.57)$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.13 to 2.19,  $P\!=\!0.008)$  ), recessive   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.67$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.22 to 2.28,  $P\!=\!0.001$  ) and  allelic   $\mathrm{{OR}}\!=\!1.62$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.04 to 2.54,  $P\!=\!0.03$  ) models. However,  no significant association was observed in 10 Caucasian studies  under any of the three models [Figure 2].  

# Association between  T786C  polymorphism of  eNOS  gene  and ischemic stroke  

The  eNOS T786C  gene polymorphism was assessed in  10 case‑control studies with a total of 2348 IS cases and 2879  controls. Borderline significant association was observed for  T786C polymorphism of  eNOS  gene and IS under dominant   $\left[\mathrm{CT}\!+\!\mathrm{CC}\right.$   vs

In the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, significant  association between  T786C  polymorphism of  eNOS  gene and risk  of IS was observed in 7 Asian studies under dominant   $(\mathrm{OR}\,\!=\!1.17,$   $95\%$   CI: 1.01 to 1.35,  $P=0.03\$  ) and allelic (  $\mathrm{{CR}}=1.25$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.09  to 1.45,  $P\,{=}\,0.002$  ) models but not under the recessive model. No  significant association was observed in the 3 Caucasian studies  under any of the three models [Figure 3].  

# Association between  4b/a  polymorphism of  eNOS  gene and  ischemic stroke  

The  eNOS   $4b/a$   gene polymorphism was assessed in  16  case‑control studies with a total of 3730 IS cases and  4220 controls. Significant association was observed for   $4b/a$  polymorphism of  eNOS  gene and susceptibility to IS under  recessive model [aa vs ab  $^+$   bb:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.65$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.01 to 2.72,  $P=0.04]$  . Borderline significant association was observed for   $4b/a$   polymorphism of  eNOS  gene and susceptibility to IS under  dominant [aa  $^+$   ab vs bb:  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.16$  ;  $95\%$   CI; 0.95 to 1.43,  $P\,{=}\,0.15]$  and allelic [a vs b:  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.18,95\%\,\mathrm{CI};0.91{-}1.53,P\,{=}\,0.21]$   models.  

In the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, significant association  between  $4b/a$   polymorphism of  eNOS  gene and risk of IS was  observed in the 12 Asian studies under dominant   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.31$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.07 to 1.61,    $P=0.009.$  ), recessive   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.45$  ,   $95\%$   CI:  1.72 to 3.49,    $P=\mathord{<\!}0.001$  ) and allelic   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.42$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.11  to 1.81,    $P\,=\,0.006$  ) models. No significant association was  observed in 4 Caucasian studies under any of the three models  [Figure 4]. Begg’s funnel plot suggested the presence of moderate  publication bias in the studies [Figure 5].  

# Meta‑regression analysis  

Meta‑regression analysis suggested that the quality of studies  did not significantly affect the strength of association between  eNOS  gene polymorphisms and risk of IS [Figure 6].

# Discussion  

The present meta‑analysis suggests that the  eNOS  gene is an  important candidate gene because of its association with IS  in the Asian population but not in the Caucasian population.  NO is known to be a potent endogenous va so dil at or which  inhibits the platelet aggregation and reduces the adherence of  leukocytes to vascular endothelium. In addition, it suppresses  the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. In this  regard, reduced NO production has been found to be linked  with vascular dysfunction. The elevation of blood pressure in  healthy individuals has been reported due to the inhibition  of  eNOS ,  whereas the production of NO is found to be  diminished in patients with essential hypertension under  basal conditions.  The  eNOS  gene catalyzes the synthesis of  NO, which is a regulator of cerebral blood flow as well as of  smooth muscle cell pro life rat or s in the arterial endothelium.  

Among the  eNOS  variants,  G894T  is the most studied variant  and is found to be associated with hypertension in Caucasian  as well as Asian populations.  It is widely accepted that  the polymorphism in  eNOS  gene modifies the NO production  which may predispose the patient to hypertension, which is a  prominent risk factor for IS.  

Biochemical evidence exists for the decreased  eNOS  gene  promoter activation, reduced protein expression, and reduced  enzyme activation because the precise molecular effects of  polymorphisms in the  eNOS  gene might be linked to the  path o physiology of stroke. It is a well‑established fact that  endo the li al dysfunction occurs in response to cardiovascular  risk factors and precedes the development of atherosclerosis.  The  T786C  polymorphism in the 5‑flanking region of the  eNOS   gene probably influences the promoter activity and thereby the  endo the li al synthesis of NO. A study  has demonstrated that

T786C  polymorphism in the 5‑flanking region of the  eNOS  gene  is in linkage d is equilibrium with   $4b/a$   polymorphism.  

The association between eNOS gene polymorphism and risk of  IS has not yet been well‑established because conflicting evidence  is present in the literature. Six published meta‑analyses that  examined the association between  eNOS  gene polymorphisms  and risk of stroke also showed conflicting evidence in  the results [Table 3]. The possible reason for inconsistent  results include (i) variation in the methodology, (ii) lack  of proper selection of studies, (iii) inappropriate or lack of  exploration of possible cause of heterogeneity in inter‑study,  and (iv) publication bias. In the present meta‑analysis, we  have taken appropriate measures to overcome the above  shortcomings.  

# G894T polymorphism of eNOS gene  

Five previously published meta‑analyses suggest a significant  association between  G894T  polymorphism and risk of IS  with an OR ranging from 1.3 to 2.01 under the dominant  model of inheritance in the Asian population but not in  the Caucasian population. The present meta‑analysis also  observed a significant association in the Asian population  under the dominant model of inheritance even after assessing  the heterogeneity using meta‑regression analysis. The  present meta‑analysis also found an association with the  risk of IS under the recessive model in the Asian population,  which is consistent with the findings of the earlier published  meta‑analysis.  The present meta‑analysis also confirms the  significant association of  G894T  polymorphism with risk of  stroke in the Asian population under the allelic model.  

# T786C polymorphism of eNOS gene  

Significant association was observed between  T786C polymorphism and risk of IS in a few earlier published  meta‑analyses; however, other studies failed to observe a  significant association [Table 3]. Our meta‑analysis suggests  that  T786C  polymorphism significantly contributes to the risk  of IS in Asians but not in Caucasians.  

# 4b/a polymorphism  

Most of the meta‑analyses observed an association between   $4b/a$   polymorphism and risk of IS in the Asian population. The  present meta‑analysis also confirms a significant association  between  4b/a  polymorphism and the risk of IS in the Asian  population but not in the Caucasian population.  

A meta‑analysis that included 33 studies demonstrated that  eNOS  ( G894T ,  4b/a , and  T786C ) gene polymorphisms are  associated with the risk of IS in Asians but not in Caucasians. Another meta‑analysis provided strong evidence that the  eNOS   T786C  polymorphism is not associated with the risk  of IS whereas the   $4{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{a}}$   and  G894T  polymorphisms might  be associated with IS, at least in the Asian population.  A

![](images/15d13eb85bfaaa810197146e9d16345fe5ecd8fb83f2a3176f1ae299d59b495e.jpg)  

meta‑analysis including 12 association studies with 2836  ischemic stroke and 3354 controls demonstrated that  T786C   polymorphism is associated with the risk of stroke mainly in  Asians among the population aged 60–65 years in particular,  but not in the Caucasian population.  Another meta‑analysis  demonstrated that  T786C  polymorphism may not be associated  with the risk of stroke while  G894T  and  4b/a  polymorphisms  might be associated with the risk of stroke at least in Asians.  

This comprehensive meta‑analysis of 27 case‑control studies  was conducted on three well characterized genetic variants of  the eNOS gene ( G894T ,  T786C ,  4b/a ) and the studies were found  to be significantly associated with all the three polymorphisms  in the Asian population and the risk of IS. In this study, the  effects of dominant, recessive, and allelic models were estimated.  However, non‑significant association was observed in all the  three polymorphisms in the Caucasian population of  eNOS  gene.  Our findings are found to be in concordance with the previously  published meta‑analyses by Niu  et al.,  and Wang  et al.  In the  case of overall analysis between the  T786C  polymorphism and risk  of IS, no significant association was found. A previous meta‑analysis  published by Liu  et al.  also showed a non‑significant association  between  T786C  polymorphism and IS risk.  

Heterogeneous evidence is observed even in the different  meta‑analyses published in the literature, and differences  in methodology or study population used by published  meta‑analyses, inappropriate statistical test, and selection  bias may explain the variation in the study results. The  present meta‑analysis examined heterogeneity by using  meta‑regression for the precise estimation of association  between  eNOS  polymorphisms and the risk of IS.

Figure 6:  Meta‑regression analysis for  eNOS  (a)  G894T , (b)  T786C , (c)  4b/a  gene polymorphisms  

The present meta‑analysis must be carefully interpreted  because of certain limitations. First, the studies included  were found to be varied in environmental factors, ethnicity,  and age. Second, the use of different methodologies for  genotyping method, matching criteria, and selection  of controls may have led to heterogeneity. Therefore,  more credible evidences are required to illustrate solid  conclusions regarding the association between  eNOS  gene  polymorphisms and risk of IS.  

In summary, our comprehensive meta‑analysis shows  a significant association between the three eNOS gene  polymorphisms ( G894T ,  T786C ,  4b/a ) and risk of IS in the Asian  population whereas no significant association was observed in the  Caucasian population. Further, no overall significant association  was observed between the  T786C  polymorphism and IS risk.  Further large prospective epidemiological studies are required  to confirm these findings and draw accurate conclusions.
