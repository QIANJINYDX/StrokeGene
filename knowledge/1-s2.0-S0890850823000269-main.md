Ischaemic stroke (IS) and venous thr ombo embolism (VTE) are two forms of thr ombo embolism that, although  distinct, seem to share numerous risk factors. Concerning genetic risk factors, while many VTE genetic markers  have been reported, inclusively by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the identification and validation of  genetic determinants underlying IS pathogen es is have been challenging. Considering that IS and VTE shared  biological pathways and a e tio logical factors, the severity of IS might be also influenced by VTE-related genetic  variants. Thus, the present study was designed to analyse the impact of six VTE GWAS-identified genetic variants  on the clinical outcome of 363 acute IS patients. Results revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  F11  rs4253417 was an independent predictor of the 5-year risk of death among patients with total anterior  circulation infarct (TACI). Namely, the ones carrying the SNP C allele presented a fourfold increase in the 5-year  risk of death compared to TT genotype carriers (CC/CT vs. TT; adjusted HR, 4.240;   $95\%$   CI,   $1.260–14.270$  ;   $P=$  0.020). This SNP is known to be associated with coagulation factor XI (FXI) levels, thus with implications in  hae most as is and inflammation. As such,  F11  rs4253417 might be a promising prognostic biomarker among TACI  patients to aid in clinical decision-making. However, additional investigation is required to confirm the study ’ s  results and dissect the underlying mechanisms.

# 1. Introduction  

# ATE) [ 2 ].  

Historically, VTE and stroke, one of the main types of ATE, are  thought to be two distinct disorders with differences in e tio pathogen es is  and treatment [ 2 ]. Venous thr ombo genesis is the third most common  cardiovascular disorder in developed countries, after ischemic heart  disease and stroke, being often a life-threatening condition. The disease  pathogen es is derives mainly from a ha emo static imbalance towards  thrombosis, which is the result of a complex interplay between envi­ ronmental and genetic factors [ 3 ]. Over the years, genome-wide asso­ ciation studies (GWAS) have identified and confirmed numerous VTE  

Thr ombo embolism is a common ha emo static-related pathology  characterized by the formation of an excessive/unnecessary blood clot  (i.e., thrombus) inside a blood vessel, which compromises the local  blood circulation (thrombosis). As a result of thrombus fragmentation,  an embolus can be formed, which may eventually plug a distant blood  vessel in a downstream location causing additional morbidity (embo­ lism) [ 1 ]. Thr ombo embo li c events can occur both in veins (venous  thr ombo embolism, VTE) and in arteries (arterial thr ombo embolism,  

susceptibility polymorphisms, most of them being single-nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) located within or near hae most as is-related  genes [ 4 ]. As for stroke, it represents the second leading cause of  death and the third most common cause of worldwide morbidity [ 5 – 8 ].  The disease manifests as an unexpected onset of a neurological deficit  caused by poor blood supply to the central nervous system due to  disruption of a brain artery (hae mor rha gic stroke, HS) or its occlusion  with a thrombus or embolus (ischemic stroke, IS), all leading to brain  damage, disability or even death [ 9 – 11 ]. The HS is the most severe  stroke manifestation, whereas IS accounts for the majority of stroke  events worldwide [ 8 , 11 , 12 ].  

Despite being characterized as distinct diseases, IS and VTE seem to  be interconnected by sharing numerous biological mechanisms. First,  the pathogen es is of both disorders relies on thr ombo genesis triggered by  the dysfunction of endo the li al cells, platelets, coagulation system and  fi bri no ly tic system. Furthermore, inflammation is a common etiologic  mechanism underlying both diseases, during which, the increased levels  of circulating inflammatory markers course with the up-regulation of  pro coagulant factors and down-regulation of anticoagulant factors, as  well as the inhibition of fi bri no ly tic activity [ 13 ]. In line with the  intricated association between these diseases is also the recognition that  several risk factors are common in IS and VTE, including advanced age,  dys lipid a emi a, metabolic syndrome, hormonal factors, acute infections,  cancer and trauma [ 1 , 13 ]. Besides, like VTE, IS seems to have a sub­ stantial genetic burden. However, while several VTE genetic markers are  well-known, the identification and validation of genetic determinants  underlying IS development and severity have proven to be challenging,  which could be due to the complexity of IS pathogen es is compared to  VTE [ 14 – 16 ].  

Given the interrelationship between these diseases, VTE GWAS-identified variants might constitute potential IS predictive and/or  prognostic biomarkers, which are currently needed for proper patient  therapeutic management. As such, this study was designed to explore  the impact of six VTE GWAS-identified SNPs on the clinical outcome of  IS patients.  

# 2. Material and methods  

# 2.1. Study cohort description  

A retrospective hospital-based cohort study was conducted with 363  consecutive patients of European ancestry with a diagnosis of acute IS,  admitted from September 2009 to April 2012 in the Department of In­ ternal Medicine of Hospital Centre S ao Jo ao, Porto, Portugal. In this  study, a follow-up protocol was set up and from each patient, a written  informed consent was obtained according to the principles of the Hel­ sinki Declaration prior to their enrolment. Furthermore, this study  received approval from the ethics committee at the Hospital Centre S ao  Jo ao (HSJ-CES 20407). The IS diagnosis was performed based on the  clinical presentation, imaging (computerized tomography, CT scan) and  magnetic resonance, MRI) and neurologic examination. The disease was  defined as focal neurologic symptoms lasting longer than   $24\textup{h}$   and/or  symptoms consistent with new lesions on MRI or CT scan. A paper case  report form (CRF) was filled in according to patients ’  available medical  records, detailed history and physical examination. The CRF encom­ passed information regarding known IS risk factors, including de­ mographic, medical history, active smoking, as well as weight and  height. Hypertension was classified as two measurements of diastolic  pressure  ${\geq}90\ \mathrm{mm\Hg}$   and/or systolic pressure  ${\geq}140\ \mathrm{mm\Hg}$   [ 17 ]. Pa­ tients were also categorized as hypertensive if they were under antihy­ pertensive therapy. Dys lipid a emi a was termed as a history of  triglycerides  $\mathrm{:\geq}150~\mathrm{mg/DL}$   or total cholestero  ${\geq}200~\mathrm{mg/GL}$   or the use of  lipid-lowering medication [ 18 ]. Diabetes mellitus was classified as a  history of fasting serum glucose level  ${\geq}126~\mathrm{mg/GL}$   on two independent  analyses before IS or haemoglobin A1c (HgA1c) levels  ${>}6.4\%$   or use of  anti diabetic medication [ 19 ]. The assessment of stroke severity was  based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the IS  subtype according to the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP)  Classification system, and the disease aetiology according to Trial of Org  10, 172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification system  [ 20 – 22 ]. The mean follow-up time was 223.95 weeks (standard devia­ tion   $(\mathrm{SD})=5.49$   weeks).  

An overall description of the clinic o pathological characteristics of IS  patients enrolled in this study is given in  Table 1 , for the entire cohort  and distributed by sex. Of the total number of patients (median age   $=$  71.00 years and mean   $\mathtt{a g e}=69.80$   years   $(\mathrm{SD}=12.11\$   years)),   $56.75\%$  were men, most of whom were under 71 years, actively smoking, with  hypertension and dys lipid a emi a.  

# 2.2. Blood sampling and genomic DNA extraction  

Patients ’  peripheral blood samples were obtained using a standard  technique and further collected in ethylene dia mine tetra acetic acid  (EDTA)-containing tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted using the  extraction kit Qiagen ® , QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$    51106),  as indicated by the manufacturer ’ s procedure.

European ancestry were gathered by screening the  NHGRI-EBI GWAS  Catalog ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ ) using the term  “ venous  thr ombo embolism ” . A total of ten VTE GWAS performed between 2009  and 2019 were identified. The initial list of SNPs   $\mathbf{\tilde{n}}=45,$  ) was submitted  to the  GWAS4D  tool ( http://mulinlab.tmu.edu.cn/gwas4d/gwas4d  /gwas4d/g was 4 d server ) to create a priority rank of the variants  based on functional genomic and epigenomic data [ 23 ]. Based on (1) the  priority rank, (2) minor allele frequency (MAF) in the Iberian population 

  $(>\!15\%)$  ) provided by  Ensembl  ( https://www.ensembl.org/index.html ), 

 (3) the putative relevance in VTE pathogen es is [ 24 ] and (4) the pre­ sumed roles in IS pathways, six variants were selected:  Coagulation factor  11  ( F11 ) rs4253417, S olute Carrier Family 19 Member 2  ( SLC19A2 )  rs2038024, Zin c finger protein, FOG family member 2  ( ZFPM2 ) rs4734879,  Contactin 6  ( CNTN6 ) rs6764623,  OTU De ubiquitin as e 7A  ( OTUD7 A)  rs7164569 and  Protein C receptor  ( PROCR ) rs10747514.  

# 2.4. Polymorphism genotyping  

Selected SNPs were genotyped using the TaqMan  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$    Allelic Discrim­ ination methodology in a Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Real-time-PCR) system (Applied Biosystems) [ 25 ]. Conditions for Real-time  PCR reactions and amplifications were previously described [ 26 ]. To  guarantee the quality of polymorphism genotyping, two negative con­ trols were included in each amplification reaction to prevent false pos­ itives, and double sampling was conducted in, at least,   $10\%$   of the  samples randomly chosen, with accuracy above   $99\%$   [ 27 ]. The geno­ typing results were individually evaluated by two researchers with no  previous knowledge regarding the patient ’ s clinic o pathological data.  

# 2.5. Statistical analysis  

Data analysis was performed using the computer software   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{{IPM@}}$   ${\tt S P S S}_{\tt G P}$    Statistics software package Version: 28.0.0.0. (IBM Corp.  Released 2021). Associations between genetic variants and patients ’  demographic and clinic o pathological data were assessed using the chi-square test   $(\chi^{2})$   and student ’ s  t -test for categorical and continuous  

# variables (age), respectively.  

The measure of clinical outcome was overall survival (OS), which  was defined as the time from disease diagnosis to patient death from all  causes or last clinical assessment. Survival curves were obtained by  means of the Kaplan-Meier method, and probabilities of survival were  analysed using the log-rank test. After an initial comparison between  Kaplan-Meier curves under the log-addictive genetic model, the most  appropriate genetic model for each genetic variant was chosen. Strati­ fied analyses considering the IS subtypes and sex were conducted for the  relevant polymorphisms (log-rank test,   $P<0.1001$  ). The 5-year risk of  death was estimated using the Cox proportional-hazards model. Multi­ variable analysis using the backward stepwise (Wald) selection method  was carried out considering the factors with individual prognostic value  according to univariate analyses   $(P<0.05)$  . All tests conducted were  two-sided and a   $5\%$   level of significance was established.

# 3.1. Genotype distribution  

The frequency of the polymorphisms ’  genotypes in our cohort is  given in  Table 2 . For  F11  rs4253417,  ZFPM2  rs4734879,  CNTN6  rs6764623,  OTUD7A  rs7164569 and  PROCR  rs10747514 poly­ morphisms, no significant statistical differences were observed between  the different genotypes of each variant and the demographic and clini­ co pathological factors of the IS patients, namely sex (male vs. female),  age   $({\geq}71\$   vs.   ${<}71$   years), hypertension (yes vs. no), dys lipid a emi a (yes  vs. no), BMI (  $'\!>\!30$   vs.  $\leq30\,\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$  , diabetes mellitus (yes vs. no), atrial  fibrillation (yes vs. no), active smoking (yes vs. no) and NIHSS score   $(>\!10$   vs.   ${\le}10.$  ). In opposition, significant associations of  SLC19A 2  rs2038024 with atrial fibrillation   $(P\,=\,0.010)$  ), dys lipid a emi a   $(P\,=$  0.043) and use of statin prior to IS event   $(P=0.012)$   were detected 

 ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The polymorphism CC genotype (C being the  minor allele) was most frequently observed among IS patients with atrial  fibrillation   $(67\%$   of CC carriers), while the A allele was markedly  observed among those without this condition   $(77\%$   of AA or AC

genotype carriers), meaning that  SLC19A2  rs2038024 might constitute a  potential predictive biomarker of atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, over   $70\%$   of IS patients carrying the polymorphism C allele had dyslipidae­ mia and   $83\%$   of those with CC genotype were under statin therapy prior  to IS subtype, suggesting a role of  SLC19A2  rs2038024 also in this  pathological condition [ 28 ].  

# 3.2. Impact of VTE-related polymorphisms on the clinical outcome of IS  patients  

Considering the overall cohort, for  F11  rs4253417,  SLC19A2  rs2038024,  ZFPM2  rs4734879,  CNTN6  rs6764623,  OTUD7A  rs7164569  and  PROCR  rs10747514 polymorphisms, no statistically significant  impact on patients ’  5-year OS was observed, independently of the  genetic model considered   $(P\ >\ 0.05)$  . A marginal association was,  however, observed for  F11  rs4253417 considering the dominant genetic  model (CC/CT vs. TT; log-rank test,  $P=0.060$  ;  Fig. 1 a). When stratifying  the analysis according to the IS subtype (lacunar infarct (LACI)/partial  anterior circulation infarct (PACI)/posterior circulation infarct (POCI)  vs. total anterior circulation infarct (TACI)), a significant impact of the  F11  rs4253417 genotypes on patients ’  5-year OS was observed for TACI  patients (CC/CT vs. TT; log-rank test,   $P=0.003\$  ;  Fig. 1 c) but not their  counterparts (CC/CT vs. TT; log-rank test,  $P=0.625$  ;  Fig. 1 b). Specif­ ically, among TACI patients, the ones carrying the C allele presented a  mean OS of 119.708 weeks   $\mathrm{{SD}}=16.498$   weeks) contrasting with the  220.592 weeks   $(\mathrm{SD}=17.463\$   weeks) observed for TT genotype patients.  Indeed, univariate Cox regression analysis confirmed the negative  impact of  F11  rs4253417C allele on the 5-year risk of death among these

patients (CC/CT vs. TT; HR, 4.358;  $95\%$   CI, 1.510 – 12.576;  $P=0.006]$  .  Furthermore, considering the subtype TACI, a stratified analysis in terms  of patients ’  sex was also conducted. A significant association with 5-year  OS was detected among female (CC/CT vs. TT; log-rank test,  $P=0.006$  ;  Fig. 1 d) but not among male patients (CC/CT vs. TT; log-rank test,  $P=$  0.205;  Fig. 1 e). Female TACI patients with allele C and TT genotype  presented a mean 5-year OS of 87.790 (  $\mathrm{{SD}}=18.215$   weeks) and 222.613  weeks   $(\mathrm{SD}=23.334\$   weeks), respectively. Concordant ly, univariate Cox  regression analysis confirmed this finding (CC/CT vs. TT; HR, 11.593;   $95\%$   CI, 1.530 – 87.851;  $P=0.018.$  ).  

Multivariable Cox regression analyses using the backward stepwise  (Wald) selection method ( Table 3 ) were conducted adjusting the effect  of  F11  rs4253417 for the demographic and clinic o pathological factors  with individual prognostic value   $(P<0.05)$  ) regarding the 5-year risk of  death among the TACI patients, namely age   $({\geq}71$   vs.   ${<}71$   years; HR,  8.709;  $95\%$   CI, 2.058 – 36.842;  $P=0.003\$  ;  Supplementary Table S2 ) and  atrial fibrillation (yes vs. no; HR, 3.181;   $95\%$   CI, 1.487 – 6.805;   $P\,=$  0.003;  Supplementary Table S2 ). Furthermore, although with no prog­ nostic value, the variable sex (male vs. female; HR, 0.556;   $95\%$   CI,  0.259 – 1.197;  $P=0.134$  ;  Supplementary Table S2 ) was also included in  the multivariable Cox regression analyses due to the potential effect of  this variable in the polymorphism impact on patients ’  prognosis. Ac­ cording to the results, TACI patients with the C allele had a fourfold  increase in the 5-year risk of death compared to TT genotype carriers,  adjusted for age (CC/CT vs. TT; aHR, 4.240;  $95\%$   CI, 1.260 – 14.270;  $P=$  0.020;  Table 3 ).

# 4. Discussion  

The prognosis assessment of IS patients remains challenging as no  biomarker appears to effectively predict their clinical outcome [ 29 ].  Nevertheless, due to the interrelationship observed between VTE and IS,  VTE GWAS-reported variants might also be helpful for these patients,  serving as genetic biomarkers both for prognosis assessment and treat­ ment guidance. Inclusively, although more studies are required, the two  most commonly known SNPs associated with VTE,  F5  rs6025 (factor V  Leiden) and  F2  rs1799963 (G20210A), have been linked to IS suscep­ tibility [ 30 , 31 ]. This suggests that the two pathological conditions might  share genetic factors. As such, studies exploring the role of other  VTE-related genetic determinants in the setting of IS are required.  Compared to other biomarkers, such as proteins, genetic variants offer  the advantage of remaining stable throughout an individual ’ s life, not  being influenced by transient factors, which allows the prediction of  long-term prognosis [ 32 , 33 ]. Thus, in the present study, the potential  impact of six VTE GWAS-reported genetic variants on the clinical  outcome of 363 acute IS patients from the North region of Portugal was  evaluated.  

In our study, for the entire cohort, no statistically significant asso­ ciations between VTE genetic determinants and patient survival were  found. Nonetheless, a marginal association was observed between  F11  rs4253417 polymorphism and patients ’  5-year OS (CC/CT vs. TT; log-rank test,   $P\,=\,0.0605$  ). Further analyses showed that this associatio was only significant among TACI patients (CC/CT vs. TT; log-rank test,  P   $=0.003)$  ), which was corroborated by Cox regression. Specifically, TACI  patients carrying the C allele (CC or CT genotypes) presented a fourfold  increase in 5-year OS compared to the ones with TT genotype (CC/CT vs.  TT; HR, 4.358;  $95\%$   CI, 1.510 – 12.576;  $P=0.006]$  . Of note, the study is  most likely not sufficiently powered (i.e. power  $\textless0.80J$  ) to detect small  effects given the small cohort size.  

The polymorphism rs4253417 locates within an intronic region of  F11  gene, which encodes for the coagulation factor XI (FXI), a protein  that participates in the intrinsic coagulation pathway [ 34 , 35 ]. By  contributing to thrombin generation, and consequently fibrin formation  and protection against fi bri no lysis, FXI is directly implicated in blood  clot formation and as such, may favour thrombus generation in patho­ logical conditions. Furthermore, FXI mediates the pro-inflammatory  kallikrein-kinin system and the vitamin-K-dependent thrombin genera­ tion, serving as an interface between these two systems [ 36 ].  Conversely, inflammation is implicated in several points of IS patho­ physiology, displaying inclusively an important impact on disease  outcome as leukocytes propagate brain tissue damage after disease onset  [ 37 , 38 ]. In accordance, higher activity levels of FXI have been impli­ cated as a risk factor for VTE, coronary heart disease and IS [ 39 – 43 ]. The  FXI expression level is regulated by three genes ( F11 ,  KNG1  and  GCKR )  with some polymorphisms being recognized to additively modulate its  circulating levels, including the rs4253417 polymorphism, which is in  strong linkage d is equilibrium with the most studied one, rs2289252   $(\mathbf{r}^{2}$   $=0.98$   in Iberian population). Although the exact biological mechanism  is not fully described, the  F11  rs4253417 C allele was previously asso­ ciated with increased FXI activity   $\left.\upbeta=5.42\right$  ,  $P=6.00\times10^{-5})$   and levels 

  $(\upbeta=6.25$  ,   $P=4.90\times10^{-5})$  , being also associated to higher VTE   $(\mathrm{OR}=$  1.27;   $P\,=\,1.21\,\times\,10^{-23})$  ) and IS risk (  $.0\tt R\,=\,2.52$  ;   $P{=}2.00\;\times\;10^{-5})$  [ 44 – 46 ].  

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a potential  association between  F11  rs4253417 polymorphism and prognosis of IS  patients, particularly with TACI, which is referred to as the most severe  subtype considering the OSCP classification system (infarct site, size and  severity) [ 47 – 49 ]. Patients with TACI have the entire anterior circula­ tion that supplies one side of the brain compromised, which explains the  higher cerebral dysfunction [ 50 ]. In our study, as previously mentioned,  the rs4253417 C allele, which is associated with higher FXI circulating  levels according to the existing evidence, was shown to exert a negative  prognostic impact. We hypothesize that the higher FXI levels might  stimulate not only pro-thrombotic but also pro-inflammatory cascades  leading to greater clot burden, which is more frequent among TACI  patients and is associated with poor prognosis as greater clot burden is  less susceptible to thr ombo lysis [ 50 , 51 ]. As result, greater infarct vol­ umes can exacerbate brain tissue damage, increasing IS severity [ 52 , 53 ].  Although biologically plausible, functional studies are required to  confirm this hypothesis.  

Epidemiological studies suggest the existence of sex differences in IS  path o physiology, which may influence disease aggressiveness [ 54 ].  When matched for age, men have a higher disease risk compared to

women. However, at older ages, this tendency is reversed and women  exhibit significantly greater disease risk [ 55 ]. Accord ant ly, the women  in our cohort were older than the men at disease diagnosis   $(P<0.001)$  .  Due to the higher incidence of IS at older ages, women are less likely to  recover, with stroke-related outcomes such as disability and quality of  life being consistently poorer [ 56 , 57 ]. In our study, the women pre­ sented a higher percentage of TACI events (34 and  $19\%$   respectively;   $P$   $=0.004)$   and a higher mean NIHSS score (9.09 and 6.98, respectively;  $P$   $=0.004)$  ), which corroborates that they may suffer more severe IS events  when compared to male subjects [ 20 , 21 ]. Beyond age, this sex-related  disparity in disease severity can be explained by differences in risk  factor profiles and disease aetiology [ 58 ]. For instance, in our study,  female patients more frequently presented a history of hypertension and  atrial fibrillation   $(87.50\%$   vs.   $74.57\%$  ,   $P\,=\,0.006$   and   $33.55\%$   vs.   $15.92\%$  ,   $P\,<\,0.001$  , respectively), which is in line with the existent  literature [ 57 ]. In general, each IS risk factor may contribute to a specific  disease pattern, which may influence disease severity. As for disease  aetiology, sex hormones are most likely the major determinants under­ lying the sex dimorphism in IS path o physiology [ 59 ]. Namely, sex  hormones are known to influence hae most as is and inflammation, both  with key roles in IS onset and propagation of brain tissue damage [ 60 ,  61 ]. Given the potential relevance of sex in IS severity and a possible  sex-dependent impact magnitude of rs4253417 polymorphism on the  prognosis of TACI patients, a stratified analysis according to sex was  further performed. In the study, a significant impact of  F11  rs4253417  polymorphism was only observed among female TACI patients.  Although the small cohort size may have prevented the detection of an  association in male TACI patients (lack of statistical power), underlying  biological mechanisms cannot be dismissed. As such, we hypothesized  that the magnitude of the  F11  rs4253417 impact on these patients ’  prognosis might be influenced by factors associated with sexual  dimorphism (for instance, sex hormones) and gender differences  (distinct behaviour and societal attitudes) [ 62 ]. Previous studies have  shown that in post menopausal women, the decrease in oestrogen level  may up-regulate the expression of coagulation factors [ 63 , 64 ]. As for  men, the effect of testosterone on the coagulation system is unclear  [ 65 – 67 ]. Considering that the majority of the female patients in our  cohort were 71 years or older, in a post menopausal stage of life, and  with more severe IS events compared to their counterparts, we hy­ pothesize that the  F11  rs4253417 C allele might have an additive effect  when combined with other present factors in these women leading to  greater infarct volumes and worse prognosis. As for male patients, which  in our cohort were significantly younger compared to their counterparts,  other biological pathways might overshadow the effect of  F11  rs4253417. Therefore, whether the small cohort size or biological  mechanisms are underlying the detection of a significant impact of this  polymorphism among female TACI patients but not among male patients  needs to be explored.  

In addition to  F11  rs4253417, patients ’  age   $({\geq}71\$   vs.  ${<}71$   years; HR,  8.709;  $95\%$   CI, 2.058 – 36.842;  $P=0.003)$   and atrial fibrillation (yes vs.  no; HR, 3.181;  $95\%$   CI, 1.487 – 6.805;  $P=0.003\$  ) were found to be pre­ dictors of the 5-year risk of death among TACI patients. In opposition,  among other variables, patients ’  sex did not present a predictive impact.  Multivariable Cox regression analysis considering the four factors ( F11  rs4253417, age, atrial fibrillation and sex) showed that  F11  rs4253417  and patients ’  age were the most relevant prognostic biomarkers in this  set of patients, with rs4253417 C allele carriers exhibiting a fourfold  increase in the 5-year risk of death compared to TT genotype carriers,  adjusted for age (CC/CT vs. TT; aHR, 4.240;  $95\%$   CI, 1.260 – 14.270;  $P=$  0.020). The lack of an independent prognostic value of atrial fibrillation  when considering patients ’  age was somewhat expected since the  prevalence of this condition is thought to be related to age [ 68 ]. As for  patients ’  sex, as previously mentioned, female patients in the overall  cohort presented more severe events. As such, further analyses are  required to dissect the influence of this variable on the prognosis of TACI  patients.  

If an impact of  F11  rs4253417 on IS patients ’  prognosis is confirmed  by functional data, beyond prognosis assessment, this SNP could be also  used for IS therapeutic management. Namely, as the FXI congenital  absence is associated with a mild bleeding disorder, this coagulation  factor has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for the generation  of more safe anticoagulant s compared to the ones currently used,  including vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulant s [ 36 , 52 ,  69 ]. As anti coagulation therapy is always associated with an increased  bleeding risk, FXI inhibitors could be used as safer alternatives for IS  therapeutic management, particularly in card i oem boli c IS patients,  without causing severe bleeding [ 36 ]. Hence,  F11  rs4253417 poly­ morphism could help identify the patients that might benefit from  anti coagulation therapy with FXI inhibitors.  

Regarding the remaining polymorphisms, no significant impact on  the patient ’ s survival was observed, regardless of the genetic model and  the IS subtype considered. Nevertheless, as this is a pioneer study, not  sufficiently powered to detect small effects, additional studies are  required to further analyse the role of these VTE-related SNPs in IS pa­ tients ’  prognosis. Furthermore, apart from disease outcome, these  polymorphisms could also exert a preponderant role on IS onset  modulating the disease pathogen es is. Briefly, the variant rs2038024 lies  within the upstream region of  SLC19A2 , which codes for the thiamine  transporter 1 (THTR1) [ 34 , 70 ]. Thiamine is a key cofactor in the  intracellular glucose metabolism, and it is thought to have a role in the  path o physiology of diabetes mellitus and dys lipid a emi a, both condi­ tions linked to endo the li al dysfunction and consequently thromboem­ bolic events [ 71 – 74 ]. Inclusively, mutations in  SLC19A2  have been  associated with diabetes mellitus via mitochondrial dysfunction, a  condition that could be ameliorated by green nano materials due to their  anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents [ 75 , 76 ]. In the present study,  significant associations between rs2038024 and both atrial fibrillation  and dys lipid a emi a were observed (  $\left(P\right.=0.010$   and  $P=0.043$  , respec­ tively), which indicate that this polymorphism may be explored as a  predictive biomarker of IS onset. Regarding the intronic polymorphism  rs4734879, it lies within the  ZFPM2 , which codes for a regulator of  GATA transcriptional factors [ 34 , 70 ]. Particularly, ZFPM2 seems to  modulate the expression of several genes involved in ang io genesis,  platelet activity, fi bri no lysis and inflammation [ 77 , 78 ]. The poly­ morphism rs6764623 is located in an intergenic region close to  CNTN6 ,  which codes for a neural adhesion molecule that intermediates cell  surface interactions during nervous system development [ 34 , 70 ]. By  activating the Notch signalling pathway, CNTN6 may regulate innate  immunity and inflammation, as the pathway is implicated in myeloid  cell differentiation, activation and function. Furthermore, as a neural  adhesion molecule, CNTN6 can also be involved in other biological  processes that dictate the patient ’ s long-term IS outcome. Regarding the  polymorphism rs7164569, it is a synonymous variant located within the  OTUD7A  gene, which codes for a de ubiquitin as e thought to modulate  both platelet activation and inflammatory responses through the nuclear  factor kappa B (NF-kB) signalling pathway [ 79 – 82 ]. As for intronic  variant rs10747514, it lies within the  PROCR  gene, which codes for the  endo the li al receptor for protein C (EPCR), an anticoagulant protein [ 79 ,  80 ]. To be noted, neither of these polymorphisms has been yet linked to  IS susceptibility and/or severity, at least to the best of our knowledge.  

In sum,  F11  rs4253417 may offer several advantages, from TACI risk  assessment to disease prevention, prognostic evaluation, and drug  development. In terms of prognostication, given the stability of genetic  polymorphisms compared to other biomarkers,  F11  rs4253417 may  allow the prediction of individual ’ s long-term clinical outcomes more  accurately, aiding in the monitoring of disease progression and opti­ misation of follow-up strategies. Furthermore, this SNP may help iden­ tify patients that could benefit more from an established treatment or  even pinpoint TACI mechanisms that could be used in drug develop­ ment, particularly in an era of bio materials to treat cardiovascular dis­ eases [ 83 ]. Nevertheless, as IS is a multi factorial condition, genetic  variants should be analysed together with other clinical factors to ensure  a proper clinical decision-making. In the present study, the retrospective  design and the small cohort size were the main limitations. The former  hindered the collection of information concerning survival time and  some clinic o pathological factors with potential prognostic value, while  the latter may have limited the detection of small effects of the poly­ morphisms on the patients ’  prognosis.  

# 5. Conclusion  

Genetic determinants underlying susceptibility for VTE development  may offer the possibility to identify IS patients that may face poor  clinical outcome and improve the selection of more appropriate thera­ peutic approaches in the acute phase [ 29 ]. In the present study, the  results suggest a potential association between TACI patient ’ s survival  and the polymorphism  F11  rs4253417, which modulates levels of FXI.  This coagulation factor is implicated in hae most as is, playing a role in  thrombus formation, but also in inflammation. As for the other evalu­ ated genetic polymorphisms, no significant result was obtained. How­ ever, as this is the first study to evaluate the impact of these genetic  variants on the clinical outcome of IS patients, and with not sufficient  power to detect small effects, additional studies with larger cohort size  are required to replicate and/or validate our findings. Moreover, func­ tional studies are needed to dissect the biological mechanisms linking  F11  rs4253417 to IS behaviour. If an association is confirmed, beyond  assessing prognosis, this genetic marker could be used to access the total  thrombotic risk (arterial and venous) of a patient for primary and sec­ ondary prevention, particularly for individuals at high risk of both dis­ eases, including on co logical patients [ 3 , 84 ]. Furthermore, this genetic  variant might inclusively pinpoint potential therapeutic targets facili­ tating precision medicine.
