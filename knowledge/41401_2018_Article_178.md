Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a member of nuclear receptor subfamily 1 ( NR1I2 ) that is a transcriptional regulator of several metabolic enzymes involved in clop i dog rel metabolism. In this study we identi ﬁ ed and evaluated the contributions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NR1I2 and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 alleles to clop i dog rel resistance (CR) and long-term clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (IS) patients. A total of 634 patients with acute IS were recruited, who received anti platelet medication (clop i dog rel or aspirin) every day and completed a 1-year follow-up. The selected SNPs were genotyped, and platelet function was measured. Modi ﬁ ed Rankin Scale (mRS) scores and main adverse cardiovascular and cerebro vascular events (MACCE) were noted to assess the prognosis. We showed that SNPs  NR1I2  rs13059232 and  CYP2C19  alleles   $(2^{*}/3^{*})$   were related to CR. SNP  NR1I2  (rs13059232) was identi ﬁ ed as an independent risk factor for the long-term clinical outcomes in the clop i dog rel cohorts   $(P<0.001]$  ), but similar results were not observed in a matched aspirin cohort   $(P>0.05)$  . Our results suggest that NR1I2  variant (rs13059232) could serve as biomarker for clop i dog rel therapy and individualized anti platelet medications in the treatment of acute IS patients.

# INTRODUCTION  

As one of the ﬁ rst-line anti platelet agents, clop i dog rel is extensively used for the treatment and prevention of ischemic stroke (IS) [ 1 ,  2 ]. Unfortunately, the individual differences in responses to clop i dog rel-based therapy are signi ﬁ cant, which seriously affects the safety and ef ﬁ cacy of its application [ 3 ]. In recent years, the mechanism underlying clop i dog rel resistance (CR) has been investigated in many ways, including demographic factors, genetic factors, and medication [ 4 – 6 ]. However, the mechanisms of CR have not been clearly explained.  

As a th ie no pyr i dine prodrug, the anti platelet effect of clop i dog rel is dependent on hepatic transformation, and many genes related to its hepatic transformation affect the pharmacokinetic response to clop i dog rel [ 7 – 9 ]. Currently, research on inter individual variations in clop i dog rel responses is mainly focused on the genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CES1) and transporters (ABCB1) [ 10 – 16 ]. However, the impact of known genetic variants could only explain a very limited portion of individual differences in CR and the clinical outcomes of IS patients [ 17 ].  

Pregnane X receptor (PXR), encoded by the  NR1I2  gene, belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily, PXR universally regulates the activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters [ 18 , 19 ]. NR1I2 genetic polymorphisms have a signi ﬁ cant impact;  

speci ﬁ cally, they affect the uptake, transport, and metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous substances. Therefore, NR1I2 genetic polymorphisms are of great signi ﬁ cance in studying the metabolic processing of clinical drugs [ 20 ,  21 ]. Nevertheless, research on the relationship between the genetic polymorphisms of NR1I2 and individual differences in the therapeutic effects of clop i dog rel is currently limited.  

In our previous studies, several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of metabolic enzymes and NR1I2 were found to be related to CR in acute IS patients; however, their in ﬂ uence on the longterm clinical outcomes of patients treated with clop i dog rel and other anti platelet drugs remains unclear [ 9 ]. The aim of the current study was to further investigate the impact of    $C Y P2C I g^{*}2$  rs4244285,    $C Y P2C I g^{*}3$   rs4986893, and  NR1I2  rs13059232 on CR and long-term clinical outcomes in patients suffering from acute IS. This study will help determine the appropriate individualized anti platelet medication.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

Study population This study protocol, approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Guangdong General Hospital, was compatible with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consents were obtained from all individual participants included in the study. This study was a double-center observational trial.  

Our research had three phases (Fig.  1 ). In phase 1, we investigated the association among relative factors, CR, and clinical outcomes. In this phase, 259 acute IS patients between 40 and 80 years of age were enrolled at the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from March 2013 to October 2015. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) compliance with the diagnostic criteria of IS and veri ﬁ cation by CT or MRI; (2) treatment with clop i dog rel for at least 5 days during hospitalization; (3) informed consent signed by patients or their relatives; and (4) recruited within   $24\,\mathsf{h}$   after stroke onset. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) silent cerebral infarction without obvious symptoms; (2) a platelet count   ${\tt>}450{\tt\times}10^{9}/\mathsf{L}$   or  ${<}150{\times}10^{9}/\mathsf{L};$   (3) long-term treatment with warfarin, heparin, ti clop i dine, di pyr ida mole and proton pump inhibitors; and (4) functional lesion on the liver or kidney. Among these patients, 192 subjects (clop i dog rel cohort 1) completed a 1-year follow-up and consistently took clop i dog rel every day during 1 year. Platelet function was measured using the light transmission ag greg ome try method to evaluate the anti platelet responses of these patients. Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX technology was used to genotype the selected SNPs. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted with patients at 6 months and 12 months after hospital discharge. In phase 2, 140 patients with acute IS at Guangdong General Hospital were enrolled to verify the results from the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Patients were recruited within   $24\,\mathsf{h}$   after stroke onset and were all treated with a daily clop i dog rel maintenance dose of   $75\,\mathsf{m g}$  during a 1-year follow-up (clop i dog rel cohort 2). All of these patients completed follow-up telephone interviews and SNP genotyping. There was no signi ﬁ cant difference in age, gender, diabetes, smoking, alcohol, or biochemical indexes among these two cohorts. In phase 3, an aspirin cohort of 302 IS patients who took a daily maintenance dose of   $100\,\mathsf{m g}$   of aspirin mono therapy during a 1-year follow-up (aspirin cohort) was enrolled from the two hospitals to study the in ﬂ uence of the selected SNPs on different anti platelet agents. This aspirin cohort was matched with the clop i dog rel cohort (including clop i dog rel cohorts 1 and 2), including age, gender, diabetes, smoking, alcohol and biochemical indexes (Table  1 ). All 302 patients completed follow-up telephone interviews and SNP genotyping.  

In total, 634 patients completed a 1-year follow-up and consistently took anti platelet agents every day during 1 year, and their demographic characteristics, clinical medications, and biochemical indexes were collected from the electronic medical records of these two hospitals.  

Platelet function testing and clop i dog rel resistance  

The light transmission ag greg ome try method was used to evaluate anti platelet reactivity responses to clop i dog rel. Peripheral blood samples were collected from patients before treatment and on days 5 – 7 after treatment. The maximal platelet aggregation rate (MPAR) was calculated by using an LBY-NJ4A automatic platelet aggregation analyzer with   $10\,\upmu\mathrm{{m o l}/L}$   adenosine diphosphate (ADP) inducer. CR was de ﬁ ned as either less than a   $10\%$  change in the MPAR   $(\mathsf{d}~5{-}7)$   or an MPAR (  $\textsf{d}5-7)>\!50\%$   of the baseline magnitude (d 0). The platelet inhibition rate (PIR) was quanti ﬁ ed as follows:   $\mathsf{P I R}=\mathsf{P A R}$     $(\mathsf{d}_{0})$  – PAR   $({\sf d}_{5})$  .   $\mathsf{P I R}<10\%\times\mathsf{P A R}$   $(\mathsf{d}_{0})$   or PAR   $({\sf d}_{5})>50\%$   PAR   $(\mathsf{d}_{0})$   was de ﬁ ned as CR.  

# Follow-up and clinical outcomes  

Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 6 months and 12 months after hospital discharge, and the data were veri ﬁ ed by

information obtained from the case management system in the medical record room of the two hospitals. Poor outcomes were de ﬁ ned as a score of more than 2 on the modi ﬁ ed Rankin Scale or the occurrence of a main adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event (MACCE), including death, myocardial infarction, and additional strokes.  

Genotyping analysis  

DNA samples were obtained from the peripheral blood, and three SNPs in two genes were genotyped: NR1I2 (rs13059232),  $C Y P2C I g^{*}2$   (rs4244285), and    $C Y P2C I g^{*}3$   (rs4986893). DNA purity and concentration were determined on a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo), and the absorbance ratios (A260/A280) of all DNA samples were between 1.6 and 1.9 to ensure quality. All of the selected SNPs were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX technology (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). DNA   $(10\,\mathsf{n g})$  samples were ampli ﬁ ed and extended using PCR ampli ﬁ cation. A 384-pad Spec tro CHIP and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Sequenom) were used to detect alleles. MassArray Typer 4.0 software was used to collect and analyze the data.  

# Statistical analysis  

Data are presented as the mean  $\pm\,\mathsf{S D}$  or in frequencies. Differences between cohorts were assessed by Pearson ’ s chisquare test (when the variables were categorical) or one-way ANOVA (when the variables were continuous). Hardy − Weinberg equilibrium and allele frequency comparisons were performed by using the chi-square test. Determination of the mode of inheritance was analyzed by comparing genotype effects. The associations among CR, clinical outcomes, and related factors were analyzed using Pearson ’ s chi-square test.    $C Y P2C19^{*}2/^{*}3$     $(^{*}2/^{*}3$  carrier  $=1$  , noncarrier  $=0.$  ) and  NR1I2  rs13059232 (  $\mathsf{C C}=1$  ,   ${\mathsf{C T}}{+}{\mathsf{T}}{\mathsf{\Gamma}}$   $=0.$  ) were added to the logistic regression analysis of CR and clinical outcomes to investigate the interaction between  $C Y P2C19^{*}2/^{*}3$   and  NR1I2  rs13059232. The cumulative risk of MACCEs was assessed using a Kaplan − Meier survival curve. Sex

 (male  $=1$  , female  $=0.$  ), age, hypertension (presence  $=1$  , absence

  $=0,$  ), diabetes (presence  $=1$  , absence  $=0$  ),    $C Y P2C19^{*}2/^{*}3$     $(^{*}2/^{*}3$  carrier  $=1$  , noncarrier  $=0$  ), and NR1I2 rs13059232 (  $\mathsf{C C}=1$  ,   $\mathsf{C T}\!+\!\mathsf{T T}=0$  ) were added to the Cox regression analysis to investigate the risk factors for MACCEs. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 21.0. Statistical signi ﬁ cance was assumed for  $P<0.05$  .  

# RESULTS  

Clinical characteristics of the study population In phase 1, 259 acute IS patients from the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were admitted to study the correlation among SNPs, CR, and clinical outcomes. A total of 192 subjects completed a 1-year follow-up and consistently took a daily clop i dog rel maintenance dose of   $75\,\mathsf{m g}$   during 1 year (clop i dog rel cohort 1). The excluded subjects are shown in Fig.  1 . The CR rate was   $33.9\%$   (  $(n=65)$  ) of the research population. Table  1 shows the clinical characteristics of the CR group and the non clop i dog rel resistance (NCR) group. There were 117 males  $(60.9\%)$   and 75 females   $(39.1\%)$   included in our study. The average age was   $66.5\pm11.7$   years. Among the 192 patients, 57   $(29.7\%)$   had diabetes mellitus and 124   $(64.6\%)$   had hypertension. There was no signi ﬁ cant difference in age, gender, diabetes, smoking, or biochemical indexes among these cohorts, but the patients with hypertension had a higher risk of CR   $(75.4\%$   vs.   $59.1\%,$  . According to the method described in  “ Follow-up and clinical outcomes ” ,  $38.0\%$     $(n=73)$  ) of these patients had poor outcomes. Patients who were identi ﬁ ed as having CR in the early period of IS had signi ﬁ cantly poorer clinical outcomes during the 1-year follow-up

SNPs  single nucleotide polymorphisms,  NCR  non clop i dog rel resistance,  CR  clop i dog rel resistance Carriers were de ﬁ ned as patients with at least one  CYP2C19  loss-of-function allele   $^{(\ast_{2}}$   or  $^{;3);}^{*}1/^{*}2,\:^{*}1/^{*}3,\:^{*}2/^{*}2,\:^{*}2/^{*}3,\:^{*}3/^{*}3$  . Noncarrier was de ﬁ ned as patients without any  CYP2C19  loss-of-function allele: wt/wt  $(^{*}1/^{*}1)$   $^{*}\!P<0.05$  Bold values in tables are used to stress statistics with signi ﬁ cant differences

than those in the NCR group (Table  2 ,   $\mathsf{O R}=1.894,$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.030 – 3.485,  $P\,{=}\,0.039$  ).  

In phase 2, the validation cohort (clop i dog rel cohort 2) comprised 140 patients from Guangdong General Hospital who consistently took clop i dog rel;   $32.9\%$     $(n=46)$   of these patients were considered to have poor outcomes. Clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes of the study population are shown in Table  1 .  

In phase 3, a cohort of 302 patients (aspirin cohort) who received a daily aspirin maintenance dose mono therapy during the 1-year follow-up was enrolled to compare the effects of selected SNPs on different anti platelet agents;   $30.8\%$     $(n=93)$   of these patients were considered to have poor outcomes. The clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes of the study population are shown in Table  1 . There was no signi ﬁ cant difference in age, gender, diabetes, smoking, or biochemical indexes between the clop i dog rel and aspirin cohorts.  

Phase 1: Association between  $C Y P2C19^{*}2/^{*}3$   and  NR1I2 (rs13059232) gene polymorphisms and clop i dog rel resistance Clop i dog rel response was valued by the change in ADP-induced platelet aggregation before and after   $^{5-7}$   days of treatment. Among 192 patients, there were three whose    $C Y P2C19\ {}^{*}2/{}^{*}3$  genotyping failed and two whose NR1I2 genotyping failed. In total,  CYP2C19    $^{*}2/^{*}3$   genotyping of 189 patients and NR1I2 genotyping of 190 patients were successful. The allele frequencies of all SNPs were in Hardy − Weinberg equilibrium   $(P>0.05)$  . Supplementary Table S1 shows the frequency of alleles in our samples and in the PubMed database. Table  3  shows the association between the  CYP2C19  and  NR1I2  gene polymorphisms and CR.    $C Y P2C19^{*}2/^{*}3$   allele carriers had a higher risk of CR compared to non carriers (carriers vs. non carriers, OR 2.108,   $95\%$   CI 1.069 – 3.808,    $P=0.0293$  ). Regarding  NR1I2  rs13059232, we  ﬁ rst discuss the inheritance mode of this SNP. Supplementary Table S2 shows the comparisons of the genotype effects of  NR1I2 rs13059232 with different modes of inheritance, con ﬁ rming dominant inheritance. The CR in  NR1I2  rs13059232 subjects with CC alleles was signi ﬁ cantly greater than  NR1I2  rs13059232 subjects with TT and CT alleles (CC vs.   $\mathsf{T}\!+\!\mathsf{T}\mathsf{C},$  , OR 2.211,   $95\%$   CI 1.183 – 4.132,  $P\,{=}\,0.0123$  ). The logistic regression analysis showed that    $C Y P2C19^{*}2/^{*}3$   and the CC genotype of  NR1I2  rs13059232 were still two independent risk factors for the occurrence of CR after combining the CYP2C19 and NR1I2 genotyping results   $(P=0.041$  , Exp   $\mathsf{\Omega(B)}=2.006;$  ;    $P\,{=}\,0.010$  , Exp   $({\mathsf{B}})=2.359,$  , respectively).  

Phase 1: Association between  NR1I2  (rs13059232) and clinical outcomes in clop i dog rel cohort 1  

To search for potential prognostic biomarkers of IS, we conducted an association analysis between the selected SNPs and clinical outcomes. Table  4  shows the correlation of selected SNPs with clinical outcomes.  NR1I2  rs13059232 subjects with CC alleles had signi ﬁ cantly worse clinical outcomes than patients with TT and CT alleles (Fig.  2 a, CC vs. TT + TC, OR 2.981,   $95\%$   CI 1.606 – 5.533,    $P<$  0.001). However, none of the  CYP2C19  SNPs correlated with clinical outcomes   $(P>0.05)$  . The logistic regression analysis showed that  

![](images/2797342e3cf959cc39a27fffb1a22ac540ceb44e900b7dec0b2ab16755885f27.jpg)  

the CC genotype of PXR rs13059232 was still an independent risk factor for the occurrence of poor clinical outcomes after combining the CYP2C19 and NR1I2 genotyping results   $(P=$  0.001, Exp  $(\mathsf{B})=2.866$ ).  

Phase 2: Validation of results from phase 1  

To further con ﬁ rm the correlation between  NR1I2 (rs13059232) and clinical outcomes of IS patients who consistently took clop i dog rel, we determined the  NR1I2  genotypes (rs13059232) of an independent cohort of 140 patients to validate the results obtained in the last step. As shown in Fig.    $^{2\flat,}$   patients with the CC genotype had signi ﬁ cantly worse clinical outcomes than patients with the CT/TT genotype (CC vs. TT + TC, OR 2.397,  $95\%$   CI 1.151 – 4.995,  $P\,{=}\,0.018,$  ). Thus, the results were validated in this independent cohort.  

# Phase 2:  NR1I2  (rs13059232) and MACCEs  

We also investigated the correlation between  NR1I2  rs13059232 and MACCEs. During the 1-year follow-up, 80   $(24.1\%)$   MACCEs occurred. Fig.  3  shows the results of a Kaplan − Meier analysis; patients with the CC genotype of  NR1I2  rs13059232 had a signi ﬁ cantly worse prognosis (CC vs.   $\mathsf{C T}\!+\!\mathsf{T}\Pi,$  ,    $P\,{=}\,0.0033$  ). Cox regression analysis suggested that the CC genotype of PXR rs13059232 and hypertension are independent risk factors for the occurrence of MACCEs   $(P=0.003\$  ,   $\mathsf{H R}=1.922$  ;    $P\,{=}\,0.018$  ,   ${\sf H R}={\sf}$  1.853, respectively).  

Phase 3:  NR1I2  (rs13059232) and anti platelet agent selection To determine whether  NR1I2  (rs13059232) also affects the therapeutic effect of aspirin, we determined the effect of  NR1I2 (rs13059232) on the clinical outcomes of IS patients who used aspirin as their secondary prevention anti platelet drug. There was no signi ﬁ cant correlation between the distribution of  NR1I2 (rs13059232) and the clinical outcomes of patients taking aspirin (Fig.  2 c,    $P\,{=}\,0.260)$  ). In addition, patients with the CC

Fig. 3 Kaplan – Meier cumulative event rates of the MACCE (death, myocardial infarction, and additional. strokes) based on the different genotypes of SNP  NR1I2  rs13059232 (CC vs.   $\mathsf{C T}\!+\!\mathsf{T}\mathsf{T},$  ,    $P=0.003\$  )  

genotype who regularly took aspirin had signi ﬁ cantly more favorable clinical outcomes than patients who regularly took clop i dog rel (Fig.  2 d,   $\mathsf{O R}=2.107$  ,    $P\,{=}\,0.006$  ), which indicates that aspirin would be a rational choice for NR1I2 rs13059232 subjects with CC alleles.  

# DISCUSSION  

In our study, by testing the MPAR of 192 patients with IS who took clop i dog rel continuously for approximately 5 – 7 days, we found that  NR1I2  rs13059232,    $C Y P2C I g*2/^{*}3$   and hypertension are independent risk factors for CR. The novel  ﬁ nding of this study is that during the 1-year follow-up period,  NRlI2  rs13059232 was identi ﬁ ed as an independent risk factor associated with clinical outcomes in patients with acute IS who continued to take clop i dog rel. Subjects with the CC genotype of  NR1I2  rs13059232 had a higher rate of poor outcomes than subjects who were T allele carriers   $(51.3\%$   vs.   $28.0\%$  ). Further comparisons were also made between IS patients who continuously took clop i dog rel and those who took aspirin; this SNP in ﬂ uenced only the cohort of patients who continuously took clop i dog rel. We also found that patients with the CC genotype who regularly took aspirin had signi ﬁ cantly better clinical outcomes than those who continued to take clop i dog rel during the 1-year follow-up (  $/{\sf O R}\,{=}\,2.107\$  ,    ${\boldsymbol{P}}=$  0.006). These new  ﬁ ndings may provide guidance for selecting clop i dog rel or aspirin as an anti platelet treatment.  

It is generally believed that CYP2C19 is the most signi ﬁ cant factor contributing to the inter individual differences in clop i dog rel responses [ 22 ]. Mutants of this gene, including    $C Y P2C I g^{*}2$   and  $C Y P2C19^{*}3,$  , can decrease metabolic activity [ 23 ]. As a result, the transformation of clop i dog rel to its active metabolite could be obstructed in patients with these mutants. Although the effect of  $C Y P2C I g*2/^{*}3$   has been con ﬁ rmed in large-scale clinical studies [ 24 ], its association with clinical outcomes is in dispute. Some studies have indicated that CYP2C19 mutants cause poor clinical outcomes in patients, but this correlation was not found in some other studies [ 11 ,  25 ]. Other studies suggest that CYP2C19 allele carriers who consistently use clop i dog rel in only the early stage have altered anti clop i dog rel platelet reactivity and clinical outcomes [ 26 ,  27 ]. In our current research, a signi ﬁ cant correlation between    $C Y P2C19^{*}2/^{*}3$   and CR was found   $(C Y P2C I9^{*}2/^{*}3$   alleles carriers vs. non carriers, OR 2.108,  $95\%$   CI 1.069 – 3.808,    $P\,{=}\,0.029)$  , but we did not  ﬁ nd a correlation between these mutations and long-term clinical outcomes.  

NR1I2  (rs13059232) is an SNP located in intron 1 of NR1I2 [ 18 ]. In our previous studies,  NR1I2  (rs13059232) was found to affect the occurrence of CR in IS patients treated with clop i dog rel [ 28 ]. Studies have shown that the expression levels of NR1I2 could be affected by gene polymorphisms of NR1I2, which could further in ﬂ uence the activities of downstream metabolic enzymes and transporters [ 20 ,  21 ]. For example, it was reported that  NR1I2 (rs13059232) in ﬂ uences the phenotypes of CYP3A4 [ 29 ], an important enzyme that metabolizes clop i dog rel. Research has also found that the activation of PXR increases the xenobiotic metabolism of clop i dog rel and decreases ADP-induced platelet aggregation [ 30 ]. Therefore, SNPs of NR1I2 may change drug ef ﬁ cacy by affecting related metabolic enzymes and transporters. A study from our research group showed that this SNP was correlated to variations in 4-OH-CPA plasma concentrations, which may be attributed to its regulation of CYP3A4 activity [ 31 ]. As a result, the activity of CYP3A4 may be down regulated in patients with the CC genotype of  NR1I2  (rs13059232), and the transformation of clop i dog rel to its active metabolite would be hindered, which could account for the higher rate of CR and worse clinical outcomes compared with those of T allele carriers. Further studies are needed to investigate the in ﬂ uence of NR1I2 SNPs on the p harm a co kinetic process of clop i dog rel.  

Apart from the effect of  NR1I2  (rs13059232) on the pharmacokinetics of clop i dog rel, the in ﬂ uence of this SNP on clinical outcomes may also be related to the extensive moderating effect of NR1I2 on other genes, such as antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic genes [ 30 ,  32 ]. For example, research has shown that the up regulation of PXR protects vascular cells against oxidative damage by regulating the glut at hi one S-transfer as e (GST) family of phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes [ 30 ]. Moreover, a previous report showed that because the nuclear receptor PXR regulates lipid metabolism, the activation of PXR by PCN could decrease plasma LDL-cholesterol levels and prevent atherosclerosis [ 32 ].  

By comparing the in ﬂ uence of  NR1I2  (rs13059232) on patients taking anti platelet drugs from different cohorts, our study provides a potential prognostic biomarker for determining the best medication for IS patients. Clop i dog rel and aspirin are the most common anti platelet drugs for the treatment and prevention of IS [ 2 ]. However, there is no consensus on the advantages and disadvantages of these two agents, and the clinical selection of anti platelet agents for stroke treatment lacks evidence [ 33 ,  34 ]. In our research, the in ﬂ uence of  NR1I2  (rs13059232) on clinical outcomes was found in the clop i dog rel cohort but not in the aspirin cohort. This result may be because PXR regulates a variety of metabolic enzymes and transporters related to clop i dog rel metabolism. In addition, in this study, patients with the CC genotype of rs13059232 who regularly took aspirin had signi ﬁ - cantly better clinical outcomes. Therefore, our results provide a novel genetic marker for determining the best individualized anti platelet medication for patients with acute IS.  

There are several limitations to our current study. (1) To further illustrate the in ﬂ uence of  NR1I2  rs13059232 on patients ’  responses to clop i dog rel, measurement of the p harm a co kinetic process of clop i dog rel and its active metabolite should be performed. (2) To improve the reliability of using  NR1I2  rs13059232 as a prognostic biomarker for the selection of anti platelet drugs for treating IS patients, a stricter prospective controlled trial is needed. (3) In addition to our three selected SNPs, many other genetic factors may in ﬂ uence the ef ﬁ cacy of clop i dog rel. Therefore, a larger sample size and investigation of the in ﬂ uence of other genetic factors are needed.  

In summary, this study showed a signi ﬁ cant correlation between NR1I2  (rs13059232) and long-term clinical outcomes in IS patients who consistently took clop i dog rel in two independent cohorts. Furthermore, the effect of this SNP on clinical outcomes was found to be affected by different anti platelet drugs, which could be of great value in selecting individualized anti platelet medications.
