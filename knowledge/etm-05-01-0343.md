Abstract.  The renin-angiotensin system has an important role  in the pathogen es is of stroke. We investigated whether two  missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs4762,  Thr207Met, T207M; and rs699, Met268Thr, M268T) of angio­ tensinogen (AGT; serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member  8) are associated with the development and clinical phenotypes  of ischemic stroke (IS) and intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We  analyzed 197 stroke patients (120 IS and 77 ICH) and 301 control  subjects. The patients were classified into subgroups in accor­ dance to the scores of the National Institutes of Health Stroke  Survey (NIHSS,  ${<}6$   and  ${\ge}6$  ) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI,   ${<}60$   and  ${\ge}60$  ). Multiple logistic regression models were used  to analyze the genotype and allele distributions of each SNP.  One of the missense SNPs, rs4762 (T207M) was associated  with the development of ICH (  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.038}$   in log-additive model  and  $\mathrm{P{=}0.021}$   in allele distributions). The   $\mathrm{T}$  allele frequency of  T207M was higher in the ICH group   $(16.2\%)$   compared with  the control group   $(9.6\%)$  . The TC haplotype frequency differed  significantly between the ICH and control groups   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.014})$  ).  With regard to clinical features, T207M correlated with the  NIHSS scores of the ICH patients   $\mathrm{(P{=}0.039}$   in co dominant 1,   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.015}$   in dominant,   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.011}$   in over dominant and   $\mathrm{P{=}0.039}$  in log-additive models). However, the two missense SNPs,  rs4762 and rs699, were not associated with IS and its clinical  features, including NIHSS and MBI scores. These data suggest  that a missense SNP (rs4762, T207M) of the AGT gene may be  associated with the development of ICH and contribute to the  neurological functional levels of ICH patients.  

# Introduction  

Environmental and genetic factors contribute to stroke patho­ genesis (1-3). A wide range of genetic studies have reported  an association between stroke and single nucleotide poly­ morphisms (SNPs) of certain candidate genes (4-7). During  the years 2001-2010, several researchers published studies  on the correlation between stroke risk in Korean patients and  the SNPs of candidate genes, including neuro peptide Y (8),  methylene tetra hydro folate reductase (NAD(P)H)  (9,10),  Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIa, receptor (CD32) (11),  interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (12,13), thromboxane A2  receptor  (14), thromboxane A synthase 1 (platelet)  (14),  ph os ph odi est erase 4D cAMP-specific (15), chemokine (C-C  motif) ligand 5 (16), interleukin 4 (16), fibrinogen  $\upbeta$   chain (17),  apo lipoprotein  E  (18), para oxon as e 1  (19), para oxon as e  2 (19), 5-methyl tetra hydro folate-homo cyst eine methyl trans­ ferase (10), peroxisome pro life rat or-activated receptor   $\upgamma$   (20),  Klotho (21), tumor necrosis factor (12), interleukin   $1\upbeta$   (12), and  Fas (TNF receptor superfamily, member 6) (22).  

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in  the regulation of blood pressure and the homeostasis of fluid  and electrolytes (23). In brief, angiotensin o gen (AGT; serpin  peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 8) is synthesized in the  liver. AGT is a circulating substrate from which renin cleaves  angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by  angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl-dip ep tid as e A) 1  (ACE, also known as kininase II). Angiotensin II, a potent  pressor substrate, stimulates aldo ster one biosynthesis.  In the central nervous system (CNS), angiotensin II also  stimulates drinking and increases vasopressin and adrenocor­ ticotropic hormone. The RAS is involved in the pathogen es is  of stroke (23,24). Several studies have demonstrated associa­ tions between gene polymorphisms concerning the RAS and  stroke (25-27). Although the RAS may be implicated in the  pathogen es is of stroke, the genetic determinants remain  unknown. The aim of this study was to assess whether AGT  SNPs were associated with the development and clinical  features of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke (IS) and intra­ cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in a Korean population.  

# Subjects and methods  

Study subjects.  The subjects were stroke patients who visited  the Departments of Neurosurgery and Emergency Medicine  in the East-West Neomedical Center and Kyung Hee Medical  Center (Seoul, Korea). We recruited 120 IS and 77 ICH patients  (Table I) and excluded patients with accidental or iatrogenic  strokes, transient ischemic attack, brain tumors and congenital  brain disorders. Each stroke patient underwent computed  tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We recruited  301 controls through a general health check-up program.  Subjects with neurological diseases, ischemic heart diseases,  immunological diseases or any severe diseases were excluded.  This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines  of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics  review committee of the Medical Research Institute, School  of Medicine, Kyung Hee University. Informed consent was  obtained from all subjects. If a stroke patient was incommu­ nicative, we obtained informed consent from a close relative  or guardian.  

Subgroups of stroke patients.  All stroke patients were classified  into one of two clinical subgroups according to the respec­ tive results of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Survey  (NIHSS) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI). The severity  of 13 neurologic symptoms was measured by the NIHSS to  evaluate the neurological functional levels of the patient. The  quality of 10 general life activities was also measured by the  MBI to evaluate the activity of daily living (ADL).  

SNP genotyping.  We selected two well-known missense  SNPs (rs4762, Thr207Met, T207M; and rs699, Met268Thr,  M268T) of the AGT gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ SNP; BUILD 132). The previously reported codon numbers  of rs4762 and rs699 are 174 and 235, respectively. T207M  and M268T refer to a threonine-to-methionine exchange in  codon 207 and a methionine-to-threonine exchange in codon  268, respectively. Peripheral blood samples were collected in  EDTA or heparin tubes from all subjects. Genomic DNA was  extracted using a QIAamp ®  DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia,  CA, USA) and the genotypes of the two SNPs were deter­ mined by direct sequencing (Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea).  We carried out polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) using the  sense and antisense primers of each SNP (Table II) under the  following conditions: 40 cycles at   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 sec,   $58^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{sec}$   and  $72\mathrm{{}^{\circ}C}$   for 30 sec, and 1 cycle at  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $5\;\mathrm{min}$   as a  final extension step. The PCR products were sequenced using  an ABI PRISM   $3730\mathrm{xl}$   analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems,  Foster City, CA, USA). SeqMan II software (DNASTAR,  Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was used to analyze the sequencing  data.  

Statistical analysis.  SNPStats (http://bioinfo.icon co logia.net/ index.php?module  $:=$  Snpstats), SNP Analyzer Pro (Istech Corp.,  Goyang, Korea) and HelixTree (Golden Helix, Inc., Bozeman,  MT, USA) were used to determine odds ratios (ORs),   $95\%$    confidence intervals (CIs), and P-values adjusting for age and  gender as co variables. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)  was calculated by the Chi-square test. Multiple logistic regres­ sion models (co dominant 1, co dominant 2, dominant, recessive  and log-additive) were employed to analyze the genetic data.  The linkage d is equilibrium (LD) block and haplotypes  between two SNPs were estimated using Haploview 4.2  (http://www.broad institute.org/scientific-community/science/ programs/medical-and-population-genetics/haploview). For  numbers  ${<}5$  , the P-value was corrected by Fisher's exact test.  Statistical significance was tested using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc.,

# Results  

Clinical features of study subjects.  The clinical features of the  stroke and control subjects are shown in Table I. The control  group   $\mathrm{(n{=}301}$  ) consisted of 163 males and 138 females. The  mean age of the controls was   $61.1{\pm}10.1\$   (mean   $\pm\mathrm{\SD}$  ) years.  The IS group   $\mathrm{(n{=}120)}$  ) comprised 68 males and 52 females,  and the mean age of the IS patients was   $65.7{\pm}12.1\$   years. The  ICH group   $\mathrm{(n{=}77)}$   had a mean age of   $56.2{\pm}12.5\$   years, and  consisted of 45 males and 32 females (Table I). The mean  ages did not differ significantly between the stroke patients   $\scriptstyle(\mathrm{IS+ICH})$   and control subjects (  $\mathrm{P}{>}0.05$  , data not shown),  whereas the mean ages of the IS and ICH patients each  differed from that of the controls   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$  , data not shown).  Therefore, we adjusted for age and gender as covariates when  obtaining statistical results from the genetic data analyses.  The stroke patients were classified into one of two clinical  subgroups in accordance with the NIHSS scores (  ${\langle}6$   and  ${\ge}6$  )  and MBI scores (  ${\langle}60$   and   ${\ge}60$  ). The numbers of IS and ICH  patients with NIHSS scores   ${<}6$   were 56 and 24, respectively  and with NIHSS scores   ${\ge}6$   were 56 and 49, respectively. The

P-values  were evaluated via logistic regression analyses adjusting for age and gender. The Fisher's exact P-value was used if the number was   ${<}5$  .

numbers of IS and ICH patients with MBI scores  ${<\!60}$   were 70  and 53, respectively, and with MBI scores  ${\ge}60$   were 25 and 14,  respectively (Table I).  

Genetic analysis.  Multiple logistic regression analysis with  adjustment for age and gender was carried out using the  following models: co dominant 1 (major allele homozygotes vs.  heterozygotes), co dominant 2 (major allele homozygotes vs.  minor allele homozygotes), dominant (major allele homozy­ gotes vs. heterozygotes+minor allele homozygotes), recessive  (major allele homozygotes+heterozygotes vs. minor allele  homozygotes) and log-additive (major allele homozygotes  vs. heterozygotes vs. minor allele homozygotes). The geno­ type and allele frequencies of the two examined SNPs are  shown in Tables III and IV. The two missense SNPs (rs4762,  Thr207Met, T207M; and rs699, Met268Thr, M268T) of the  AGT gene were in HWE in the IS, ICH and control groups   $_\mathrm{(p>0.05}$  , data not shown). The T207M and M268T SNPs were  not associated with the development of IS (Table III). As  shown in Table IV, one of the missense SNPs (T207M) was  weakly associated with the development of ICH   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.038}$  ; OR,  1.73;   $95\%$   CI, 1.04-2.89 in log-additive model). The T allele  frequency of T207M was higher in the ICH group   $(16.2\%)$    than in the control group   $9.6\%$  ;  $\mathrm{P{=}0.021}$  ; OR, 1.82;   $95\%$   CI,  1.10-3.02). The genotype and allele frequencies of   $\mathrm{M}268\mathrm{T}$    showed no differences between the ICH and control groups  (Table IV). These data suggest that the rs4762 (T207M) SNP  of the AGT gene may be associated with ICH and the T allele  of rs4762 may be a risk factor for the development of ICH.  

Analysis of clinical phenotypes.  All stroke patients were  divided into clinical subgroups in accordance to the score of  the NIHSS (  ${\langle}6$   and  ${\ge}6$  ) and MBI   ${\langle}60$   and  ${\ge}60$  ). As shown in  Table V, one of the missense SNPs (T207M) was associated  with the NIHSS scores of the ICH patients (  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.039}$  ; OR, 6.33;   $95\%\,\mathrm{CI},1.25{\cdot}32.13$   in co dominant 1;  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.015}$  ; OR, 4.85;  $95\%$   CI,  1.19-19.65 in dominant;  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.011}$  ; OR, 6.09;   $95\%$   CI, 1.21-30.55  in over dominant; and   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.039}$  ; OR, 3.01;  $95\%$   CI, 0.94-9.62 in  log-additive models). The   $\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{T}$   genotype frequency of rs4762  was higher in the  $\mathrm{{NISTSS}\ge6}$  group   $(32.6\%)$   than in the NIHSS   ${<}6$   group   $(8.3\%)$  . The T allele frequency of rs4762 was also  higher in the   $\mathrm{{NuHSS}\geq6}$   group   $(20.4\%)$   than in the NIHSS   ${<}6$  group   $(8.3\%)$  . However, rs699 did not correlate with the NIHSS  scores of the ICH group (Table V). Furthermore, rs4762 and  rs699 did not correlate with the MBI scores of the ICH group  (data not shown). In the IS group, rs4762 and rs699 were not  associated with NIHSS and MBI scores, respectively (data not  shown). These results suggest that rs4762 may contribute to the  neurological functional levels of the ICH patients.

and rs699 of the AGT gene. The LD block was moderately  made between the two tested SNPs (  $\mathrm{{VD}}{=}0.707$   and  $\mathrm{r}^{2}{=}0.012$   in  the control group;  $\mathrm{D}{=}0.701$   and  $\mathrm{r}^{2}{=}0.013$   in the IS group; and   $\mathrm{D}{=}0.793$   and  $\mathrm{r}^{2}{=}0.017$   in the ICH group). We also investigated  the association between the haplotypes of these two SNPs and  stroke. In Table VI, the frequencies of CC, CT, and TC haplo­ types are shown to be 0.714-0.717, 0.176-0.178, and 0.101-0.107,  respectively. The TC haplotype differed between the ICH group  and the controls   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.014})$  , but not between the IS group and  the controls. These results suggest that the haplotype of  $\mathrm{ns}4762$  and rs699 may be associated with the development of ICH.  

# Discussion  

In the CNS, AGT is mainly distributed in glial cells in close  proximity to renin-containing neurons and is also expressed  in astrocytes (28,29). The variant of AGT is considered to be  a risk factor in various diseases and to be significant in body  fluid homeostasis. In the study by Hajjar  et al  (30), which inves­ tigated cerebral blood flow regulation, the rs699 SNP (M268T)  was associated with va so reactivity in Caucasians. Buroker  et al  (31) reported that the AGT 268M allele was associated  with mountain sickness. Gomez-Gallego  et al  (32) suggested  that the C allele of M268T may favor power sports perfor­ mance. A study by Yugar-Toledo  et al  (33) showed that carriers  of the 268T allele were at increased risk for resistant hyperten­ sion, particularly if they were older than 50 years. However,  Conen  et al  (34) reported that rs699 was not associated with  blood pressure progression and incident hypertension in a large  cohort of Caucasian women. Underwood  et al  (35) revealed that  minor allele carriers of rs699 were associated with significantly  decreased level of insulin resistance when assessed with the  homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. However,  Conen  et al  (36) reported a lack of association between rs699  and incident type 2 diabetes. Ahluwalia  et al  (37) demonstrated  that the frequencies of T allele and MT/TT genotype in rs699  were higher and associated with increased risk of diabetic  ne phr opa thy in Asian Indians. A study by Wang  et al  (38) indi­ cated that rs699 may confer a predisposition to acquired atrial  fibrillation in Han Chinese. Freitas  et al  (39) found that the rs699  TT genotype increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk in  subjects with hypertension and dys lipid emi a. In addition, Tsai  et al  (40) reported that the effect of the AGT gene haplotype  on CAD disease risk increased significantly in females with  hypertension. Zakrzewski-Jakubiak  et al  (41) demonstrated  that the haplotype between variant allele of rs4762 and variant  allele of rs699 was associated with heart failure. However,  Renner  et al  (42) reported that the genotypes and haplotypes of  rs4762 and rs699 did not correlate with hypertension, CAD and  myocardial infarction.  

Focusing on stroke, Saidi  et al  (26) reported that rs699  was associated with IS in Tunisians, but rs4762 was not. Um

et al  (27) revealed that the genotype distribution of rs699  differed between Korean IS patients and controls. Brenner  et al  (24) showed that 207M had a weakly protective effect  against brain infarction and 268M was strongly associated  with 5-year vascular mortality in Caucasian patients. However,  Sethi  et al  (43) reported that rs4762 and rs699 were not associ­ ated with increased risk for IS in Europeans. These observed  discrepancies may result from differences in ethnicities and/or  sample sizes. Our results revealed that the genotypes, alleles  and haplotypes of rs4762 and rs699 were not correlated with  the development of IS in the Korean population. This agrees  with results of the study by Sethi  et al  (43) However, our data  revealed that rs4762 was associated with the development of  ICH and with the NIHSS scores of the ICH group.  

The AGT protein (UniProt ID, P01019) comprises 485 amino  acids (AAs) with a signal peptide (from 1 to 33 AAs), AGT chain  (from 34 to 485 AAs) and several peptides, including angio­ tensin-1 (from 34 to 43 AAs), angiotensin-2 (from 34 to 41 AAs)  

and angiotensin-3 (from 35 to 41 AAs) (http://www.uniprot. org/uniprot). Two missense SNPs (rs4762, ACG207ATG,  T207M and rs699, ATG268ACG, M268T) are located in the  AGT chain. The underlined characters in ACG207ATG and  ATG268ACG indicate nucleotide substitution at each site,  resulting in threonine-to-methionine and methionine-tothreonine exchanges in codon 207 and codon 268, respectively.  In the HapMap (http://www.hapmap.org/; genome build 36)  and the SNP database, the C and T allele frequencies in the  rs4762 SNP are reported to be 0.891 and 0.109 in Europeans,  0.969-0.959 and 0.031‑0.041 in Sub-Saharan Africans, 0.918  and 0.082 in Japanese, 0.919-0.863 and 0.081‑0.138 in Chinese  and 0.889 and 0.111 in Koreans, respectively. In our control  group, the C and T allele frequencies were 0.904 and 0.096,  respectively, which are similar to those observed in Asian  populations. The T and C allele frequencies in the rs699 SNP  were reported to be 0.588 and 0.412 in Europeans, 0.255-0.080  and 0.920-0.745 in Sub-Saharan Africans, 0.163 and 0.837 in  Japanese and 0.134‑0.279 and 0.866-0.721 in Chinese, respec­ tively. In our control group, the T and C allele frequencies  were 0.181 and 0.819, respectively, which are similar to those  observed in Japanese individuals. The C allele frequencies of  rs699 in Asians are higher than in Europeans. The rs699 SNP  shows ethnic differences in its allele distributions. Our results  revealed that the TC haplotypes between rs4762 and rs699 were  associated with ICH. Considering the ethnic differences in the  C allele frequencies of rs699, our results may, in part, explain  a medical phenomenon concerning the high ICH incidence in  Asians. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of  whether two missense SNPs (rs4762 and rs699) of AGT are  associated with the development and clinical subgroups of  stroke (IS and ICH) in a Korean population. We found that  a missense SNP rs4762 (T207M) was associated with the  development of ICH   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.038}$   in log-additive model,   $\mathrm{P{=}0.021}$  in allele distributions). The T allele frequency of T207M was  higher in the ICH group   $(16.2\%)$   than in the control group   $(9.6\%)$  . Moreover, T207M was related to the NIHSS scores of  ICH (  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.039}$   in co dominant 1,  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.015}$   in dominant,  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.011}$  in over dominant, and   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.039}$   in log-additive models). In  addition, the TC haplotype between rs4762 and rs699 differed  between the ICH and control groups   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.014})$  . This study  has certain limitations. First, the number of cases is low. In  addition, we lacked age‑matched samples among the study  groups. Additional studies of a large number of cases and/or  age-matched populations are required to confirm our results.  

The present study suggests that a missense SNP (rs4762,  T207M) of the AGT gene may be associated with the develop­ ment and neurological functional levels of ICH in a Korean  population.
