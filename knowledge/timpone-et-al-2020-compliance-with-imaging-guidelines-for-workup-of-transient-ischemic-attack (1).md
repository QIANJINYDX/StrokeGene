BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:  Multiple societal guidelines recommend urgent brain and neuro vascular imaging in patients with  transient ischemic attack (TIA) to identify and treat risk factors that may lead to future stroke. The purpose of this study was  to evaluate whether national imaging utilization for workup of TIA complies with society guidelines.  

METHODS:  Analysis utilized the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Primary analysis was performed on a 2017  cohort, and secondary trend analysis was performed on cohorts from 2006 to2017. Patients diagnosed and discharged  from emergency departments with TIA were identified using  International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision  and  Tenth  Revision  codes. Brain and neuro vascular imaging obtained during the encounter was identified using Current Procedural  Terminology codes. Demographics, health insurance, patient income, and hospital-type covariates were analyzed using a  hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of obtaining neuro vascular imaging during an  emergency department encounter.  

RESULTS:  In 2017, there were 167 999 patients evaluated and discharged from emergency departments with TIA. The  percentage of patients receiving brain and neuro vascular imaging was  $78.5\%$   and   $43.2\%,$  , respectively. The most common  imaging workup utilized was a solitary computed tomography–brain without any neuro vascular imaging   $(30.9\%$   of encounters).  Decreased odds of obtaining neuro vascular imaging was observed in Medicaid patients (odds ratio, 0.65   $[95\%$   CI,   $0.58-$  0.74]), rural hospitals (odds ratio, 0.26   $[95\%$   CI, 0.17–0.41]), nontrauma centers (odds ratio, 0.40   $[95\%$   CI,   $0.21\!-\!0.74])$  ),  and weekend encounters (odds ratio, 0.91   $[95\%$   CI, 0.85–0.96]). Trend analysis demonstrated a steady rise in brain and  neuro vascular imaging in 2006 from   $34.9\%$   and  $6.8\%$   of encounters, respectively, to  $78.5\%$   and   $43.2\%$   of encounters in  2017.  

CONCLUSIONS:  Compliance with imaging guidelines is improving; however, the majority of TIA patients discharged from the  emergency department do not receive recommended neuro vascular imaging during their encounter. Follow-up studies are  needed to determine whether delayed or incomplete vascular screening increases the risk of future stroke.

E arly detection of transient ischemic attack (TIA)  cause is essential as the risk of subsequent stroke  may be reduced by prompt imaging assessment and  treatment.  

Multiple societal guidelines recommend urgent  brain and neuro vascular imaging of TIA, preferably  within 24 hours of symptom onset.  Specific recommendations include obtaining magnetic resonance  imaging as the preferred brain imaging modality, with  computed tomography (CT)–brain as a secondary  option should magnetic resonance imaging be unavailable. For neuro vascular imaging of the cr a nio cervical

vessels, computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography is preferred; however,  duplex ultrasound may also be utilized to assess cervical vessels.  

With studies reporting declining inpatient admission  trends for workup of TIA, and majority of TIA workups  now being performed in the emergency department  (ED), there will be continued increased responsibility of  EDs to obtain proper imaging for TIA risk stratification.  

The purpose of this study was to assess national  imaging utilization in TIA patients discharged from the  ED and to evaluate compliance with imaging recommendations for urgent brain and neuro vascular imaging.  

# METHODS  

# Data Source  

We utilized the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample  (NEDS), which is the largest all-payer ED database in the United  States. The NEDS data contains no patient-level or hospital-level  identifiers, therefore, not requiring formal review per institutional  review board guidelines. The data that support the findings of this  study are available from the corresponding author upon request.  

# Study Population  

TIA-related encounters were extracted from NEDS using  International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision  and  Tenth  Revision  codes ( Data Supplement ) on all patients admitted and  discharged from an ED encounter with top diagnosis field code  of TIA. Primary analysis was performed on the 2017 cohort  to assess the most current imaging practices, with secondary  trend analysis performed on the 2006 to 2017 dataset.  

Within each TIA-related ED encounter, associated brain  and neuro vascular imaging performed was identified using  Current Procedural Terminology codes for CT-brain, MR-brain,  CT-perfusion, computed tomography angiography-head/neck,  magnetic resonance angiography-head/neck, and carotid  ultrasound ( Data Supplement ).  

# Outcome and Statistical Analysis  

The primary outcomes of interest were brain imaging (CT-brain  or MR-brain) and neuro vascular imaging (computed tomography angiography-head/neck, magnetic resonance angiography-head/neck, carotid ultrasound) occurring during the ED  encounter. Using 2017 cohort data, neuro vascular imaging  utilization was further investigated with a hierarchical multivariable logistic regression to identify independent predictors of  obtaining such imaging in a TIA-related ED encounter, accounting for clustering at the hospital level.  

Statistical analysis was performed with SAS (version 9;  Cary, NC), and graphics were created using R (version 3.6.0;  Vienna, Austria).  

# RESULTS  

In 2017,   $62\%$   of all TIA encounters were discharged  from the ED without hospital admission. We identified  167 999 non admitted TIA-related ED encounters in  2017 (Table). Of these encounters,  $78.5\%$   received brain  imaging (CT-brain or MR-brain) and  $43.2\%$   received neurovascular imaging (computed tomography angiographyhead/neck, magnetic resonance angiography-head/

The most common brain and neurovascular imaging studies obtained per encounter were  CT-brain   $(73.5\%)$  ) and carotid ultrasound   $(20.7\%)$  ). The  most common imaging workup was a solitary CT-brain  without any neuro vascular imaging component   $(30.9\%$  of encounters).  

Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis for the outcome of obtaining neuro vascular imaging  during a TIA-related ED encounter is shown in Figure 2. Of note, decreased odds of obtaining neurovascular imaging was observed in Medicaid patients (odds  ratio [OR], 0.65   $[95\%$   CI, 0.58–0.74]), rural hospitals  (OR, 0.26   $\cdot95\%$   CI, 0.17–0.41]), nontrauma centers 

 (OR, 0.40  $[95\%$   CI, 0.21–0.74]), and weekend encounters (OR, 0.91  $[95\%$   CI, 0.85–0.96]). There was a trend  towards significant decreased odds of obtaining neurovascular imaging with decreasing median household  income. Patients with one of the top 3 co-occurring  com or bidi ties (hypertension, diabetes mellitus type-II,  hyper lipid emi a) had increased odds of obtaining neurovascular imaging (OR, 1.20   $[95\%$   CI,   $1.13\substack{-1.26]}$  ).  Patient age and sex, although statistically significant,  were not clinically meaningful in its association with  odds of neuro vascular imaging.  

Trend analysis of 1 540 096 TIA-related ED encounters from 2006 to 2017 demonstrated a steady rise in

brain and neuro vascular imaging from   $34.9\%$   and  $6.8\%$  of encounters, respectively, in 2006 to  $78.5\%$   and  $43.2\%$  of encounters in 2017 (Figure  1B-D). Figure  1C and  1D also demonstrate a qualitative association between  increasing brain and neuro vascular imaging utilization  and release of various societal TIA imaging guidelines.  

# DISCUSSION  

This study highlights improving but still suboptimal utilization of recommended imaging for ED workup of TIA in  a large national sample of patients. Most notable is the  observation that less than half of all patients discharged  from EDs with a diagnosis of TIA receive any cr an ioc e rvical vessel screening during their encounter on evaluation  of the most recent year of available data (2017). Without  neuro vascular imaging, modifiable vascular risk factors  cannot be recognized or addressed.  

The observed incomplete imaging practices in TIA  may, in part, be attributable to lack of provider familiarity  with imaging recommendations. We have demonstrated  a qualitative association between release of societal  guidelines and an increase in appropriate imaging utilization. As such, increased societal communication could be  a focus of efforts to further improve imaging workup of  TIA nationally. Although increased neuro vascular imaging observed in patients with vascular risk factors may be  attributable to the higher pretest probability of detecting  a treatable vascular lesion, decreased utilization of neurovascular imaging in patients insured by Medicaid, rural  hospitals, nontrauma centers, and weekend encounters  suggests that patient and hospital resources may also  play an important role in determining who gets recommended imaging during an ED encounter. Similar patient  demographic and hospital characteristic-dependent  disparities in imaging-resource utilization have been  described in the ED evaluation of other disease processes, including acute ischemic stroke.  

This study has several limitations. The NEDS data  does not capture imaging performed as an outpatient  following discharge. Although the safety of deferring  imaging beyond the initial TIA encounter is unknown, it  is likely that some patients who did not receive the recommended imaging studies during their ED encounter  would have received imaging as an outpatient follow-up,  perhaps as part of a dedicated TIA clinic. It is unknown,  however, what percentage of discharged patients may be  lost to follow-up or are able to acquire imaging within the  recommended 24 hours of symptom onset. The NEDS  also has incomplete imaging utilization information on  inpatients and, therefore, higher risk patients admitted  following their ED encounter were not included in this  study. Lastly, this study relies on  International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision  and  Tenth Revision  codes,  which may be subject to error, as is the case with the  study of any large administrative database. Although the  clinical diagnosis of TIA can be challenging, a study of  International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision  emergency administrative data has shown that TIA is  diagnosed in the ED with high specificity.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

Compliance with TIA imaging guidelines is improving;  however, there remains a large proportion of ED encounters without hospital admission where recommended  imaging is not obtained. Most notable among imaging  deficiencies is the acquisition of urgent neuro vascular  imaging, with a majority of patients not receiving this  screening during their ED encounter. Future studies are  needed to assess whether ED encounters with incomplete or deferred imaging workup of TIAs are associated  with increased risk of subsequent stroke. Research is  also needed to study the underlying causes for patient-and hospital-level disparities in imaging utilization during  assessment of TIAs and to provide solutions to improve  equitable access to imaging.
