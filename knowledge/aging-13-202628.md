# ABSTRACT  

Serum concentration of apo lipoprotein B (Apo B) is causally associated with arteriosclerosis cardiovascular  disease (ASCVD) risk. Whether ATP-sensitive potassium channels ( KATP ) variants predict the risk of increased  Apo B concentration   $\left(\geq\,80\,\textsf{m g}/\mathsf{d l}\right)$   and related ASCVD remain less clear. We recruited 522 subjects with  elevated Apo B concentration   ${\left\langle{\ge80\ \mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{d L}}\right\rangle}$   and 522 counterpart subjects   $(<80~\mathsf{m g/d u})$   from South China to  assess the associations of  KATP  variants (rs11046182, rs78148713, rs145456027 and rs147265929) with the risks  of increased Apo B serum concentration   ${\left\{\geq\,\mathbf{80}\,\,{\mathsf{m g}}/{\mathsf{d u}}\right\}}$  , carotid artery stenosis (CAS)   $\ge50\%$   and new-onset  ischemic stroke (IS). Our results showed that only  KATP  SNP rs11046182 (GG genotype) was associated with  increased risk of Apo   ${\tt B}\geq{\tt80\ m g}/{\tt d l}$   (adjusted   ${\bf0R}{\bf=}{\bf2.17}$  ,   $\pmb{P}{<}0.001,$  ) and   ${\mathsf{c A S}}\geq50\%$   (adjusted   ${\tt O R}{=}2.63$  ,  $\pmb{P}{=}\pmb{0.011},$  ).  After median 50.6-months follow-up, subjects carrying GG genotype of rs11046182 were associated with higher  risk of new-onset IS (adjusted   ${\bf H R}{=}{\bf2.24}$  ,   $\pmb{P}{=}\pmb{0.024}]$  ). Further, the exosome-derived microRNAs (exo-miRs)  expression profile was identified by next-generation sequencing. 41 exo-miRs were significantly differential ly  expressed under cross-talk status between high Apo B level   ${\langle\geq80\ {\mathsf{m g}}/{\mathsf{d u}}\rangle}$   and  KATP  rs11046182. Our study  demonstrated that  KATP  variant rs11046182 was associated with higher risks of elevated serum Apo B levels  and its related ASCVD, and the possible mechanism was related to specific exo-miRs expression profile of  KATP   rs11046182.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Apo lipoprotein B (Apo B) is the major protein  constituent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  (LDL-C). Increased serum level of LDL-C is  recognized to be an independent risk factor for  at hero sclerotic-related events [1], such as carotid  arteriosclerosis stenosis (CAS)   $\ge50\%$   and ischemic  stroke (IS). According to the amount of cholesterol  ester in the core of LDL-C particle, LDL-C particles  are different in sizes and densities such as small,  intermediate and large dense LDLs, containing one  molecule of Apo B per LDL-C particle regardless of its  size. Although in most cases, the independent risk  factor for at hero sclerotic-related events is not smaller  LDL particles, subjects with more of this type of LDL  particles will be at higher risk for future cardiovascular  events. However, epidemiological studies still fail to  

distinguish the relative a the rogen i city caused by  different sizes of LDL particles. This suggests that it is  not the composition (sizes and densities) of LDL-C  particles, but its quantity (Apo B content) that is the  key factor of atherosclerosis. Smaller LDL particles are  more likely to enter the arterial wall, and are more  susceptible to oxidation, which is essentially as a result  of the conformation-changing of Apo B with  decreasing LDL particles size. For most individuals,  the serum level of Apo B is largely concordant with  that of LDL-C, and adds minor effect to LDL-C based  risk assessment. However, in a subgroup with  in consist en ce between the serum levels of Apo B and  LDL-C, there is a redundant risk is related to an excess  risk of at hero sclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)  [2]. On the other hand, statins can control LDL-C  levels, but a residual risk of ASCVD still remains,  related to high Apo B levels, especially in people with  obesity, metabolic syndrome or (and) diabetes [3]. In  statin-treated patients, Apo B levels rather than LDL-C  levels indeed better predict subsequent ASCVD events.  Hence, Apo B levels are more closely associated with  ASCVD than LDL-C levels, are the principal drivers of  this process, and may be demonstrably a better  biomarker for assessing potential ASCVD risk. Statin  therapy is linked to decreases risk of ASCVD events,  but the profits could be declined by inherent genetic  risk. Thus, it is a promising public approach for early  ASCVD prevention based on earlier genetic assessment  of subjects at increased risk of higher Apo B serum  concentrations.  

The ATP-sensitive potassium channels   $(K A T P)$   plays as  essential well-fidelity metabolic sensors, and also as an  important end effector of ischemic preservation,  indicating that   $K A T P$    couples metabolic abnormalities  to protection against ischemic-related injury. This also  emphasizes   $K A T P$   as novel targets for prevention and  treatment of ASCVD. The structure of   $K A T P$    is large  he ter omul time ric protein complex, consisted of four  inwardly-rectifying potassium channel subunits (poreforming subunits, Kir6.x) and four s ulf ony lure a receptor  subunits (regulatory subunits, SURx). The   $\mathrm{Kir6.x}$   poreforming subunits are encoding respectively by KCNJ8  (Kir6.1) and KCNJ11 (Kir6.2) (chromosomal mapping  to 12p12.1) while SURx regulatory subunits are  respectively by ABCC8 (SUR1) and ABCC9 (SUR2)  (chromosomal mapping to 11p15.1). The subunit  constitution of   $K A T P$   possibly remodel with different  physiological and pathological circumstances, involving  in substitute splicing of these coding genes as  mentioned above, which can result in different subunits  being functional in different status. The   $K A T P$   has  extremely high genetic diversity.   $K A T P$   mutations were  not only correlated with serum lipid disorder [ e.g. ,  triglyceride (TIRG), total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C or  (and) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)]  

 [4–6] and ASCVD [7, 8] but also exhibited ethnic and  geographical heterogeneity ( e.g. , Europeans, Africans  or East Asians). Nevertheless, the associations of  $K A T P$  mutations with Apo B serum level and its related  ASCVD in China are still unclear. Theoretically, the  relationship shows the characteristics of ethnic-specific  genetic pleiotropy [9] but there may be a mutual genetic  basis between lipid disorder and ASCVD [10].  

The occurrence and development of elevated Apo B  serum concentration and its related ASCVD arises from  complex interaction between genetic and environment  factors. The exosome-derived microRNAs (exo-miRs)  are one of the main classes of non-coding RNAs, and  play a critical role as bridge that links genetic   and environment factors. Exosomes are important  extracellular vesicles with lipid bilayer membrane, and  carry cell-specific medium for mediating inter cellular  communication, especially microRNAs (miRs). The  miRs are a class of small (about 22-25 nucleotides long)  and endogenous single-stranded RNAs, with an  established function of regulating genes at transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps. The exo-miRs  take part in almost every physiological or pathological  processes ranging from elevated Apo B level to  ASCVD. However, the circulating expression profile of  exo-miRs and its effect in the process from genotype  ( KATP  variants) to phenotype (elevated Apo B serum  levels) remain elusive. In present study we investigate  possible associations of   $K A T P$   variants with the risks of  increased Apo B serum levels   $(\geq~80~\mathrm{\meg/dL})$   and  ASCVD ( e.g. ,   $\mathrm{CAS}\geq50\%$   and new-onset IS) in South  China, and identify the plasma expression profile of  exo-miRs among subjects under specific genotype  ( KATP  variants)-phenotype (Apo   $\mathrm{~\bar{B}~}\geq\mathrm{~80~}\mathrm{~m g/d\bar{L})}$  correlations.  

# RESULTS  

# Clinical baseline characteristics of participants  

Participants with or without higher Apo B serum  concentration   $(\geq\mathrm{~\ensuremath~{~80~}~}\mathrm{~\ensuremath~{~m g}/d L)~}$   showed significant  differences on serum concentration of TRIG, TC and  LDL-C (all   ${\cal P}{<}0.001\rangle$  ), as shown in Table 1. After a  median  follow-up  of  50.6-months,  there  was   no  significant  difference  on  NYHA  functional  classification between the two groups as well as  combined medication, including anti platelet drugs, betareceptor blockers (BBs), calcium channel blockers  (CCBs), digoxin, diuretics, hypoglycemic agents,  mineral oc or tico id receptor antagonists (MRAs), nitrates,  renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RSIs), statins, and  warfarin (all  ${\cal P}{\>}0.05$  ), as shown in Table 2.

# Association between  KATP  rs11046182 and newonset IS  

Subjects carrying GG genotype of  KATP  rs11046182  were correlated with elevated new-onset IS risk  (adjusted   $\mathrm{{HR}}{=}2.24$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.11-4.50,   $P{=}0.024)$   via a  median follow-up of 50.6 months, as shown in Figure 1.

(RPM) values   $<10$  , and   $P<0.05$   as threshold cutoff to  exclude the low expression of exo-miRs, 41 exo-miRs  were then found to be obviously DE between the two  genotypes   $\scriptstyle(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{G}\mathbf{A}$   vs. GG) of rs11046182, as shown  in Supplementary Figure 1, Figure 2 and Table 6.  Twenty  eight  exo-miRs  were  up-regulated  in  participants with GG genotype of rs11046182 compared  to those with A-allele   $(\mathrm{AA}+\mathrm{GA})$   while 13 exo-miRs  were down-regulated, as shown in Table 6. In particular,  miR-22-3p had the highest expression level among the  41 DE exo-miRs. The highest up-regulated and downregulated miRs were miR-320d (5.34-fold changes) and  miR-493-5p (5.04-fold changes), respectively. The  miR-208a-3p, miR-208b-3p and miR-499a-5p belong to  the miR-208 family based on highly homologous  sequence. Besides miR-208 family, there were also  anther three exo-miRs families as follows: miR-193  ( e.g. , 193a-5p and 193b-5p), miR-320 ( e.g. ,  $320\mathrm{c}\!\sim\!320\mathrm{e})$  ),  and miR-378 ( e.g. , 378a-3p, 378b\~378h). In addition,  only 6 of the 41 DE exo-miRs were found to be  obviously DE between the two genotypes (  $\mathrm{\AA+GA}$   vs.  GG) of rs11046182 in participants with decreased  serum Apo B levels   $(<80~\mathrm{mg/dL})$  ). 2 exo-miRs (miR31-5p and miR-497-5p) were up-regulated and 4 exomiRs   $\mathrm{(miR-}320\mathrm{c/d}$  , miR-4429 and miR-134-5p) were  down-regulated in subjects carrying GG genotype of  rs11046182 compared to those with   $\mathrm{\AA+GA}$   genotype,  as  shown  in  Supplementary  Figure  2  and  Supplementary Table 9. It exhibited opposite expression  patterns in subjects with or without increased Apo B  serum levels   $(\geq\ 80\ \ \ \mathrm{mg/DL})$   under the genetic  background of  KATP  rs11046182.  

# GO analysis of enriched categories  

Three terms of GO enriched categories analysis was  carried out for those candidate target genes (CTGs)  regulated by the top 10 DE exo-miRs, as shown in  Figure 3. The CTGs of DE exo-miRs in high Apo B  levels subjects with GG genotype of rs11046182 were  obviously associated with the following biological  processes: regulation of signaling, apoptotic process,  protein complex subunit organization, vesicle-mediated  transport, oxidation-reduction/homeostatic/lipid metabolic  process, ang io genesis and autophagy so on, involving in  the following cellular component such as vesicle,  endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion and membrane  protein/transcription factor/trans membrane transporter  complex. Molecular functions affected by predicted  target genes of DE exo-miRs, and can be mainly  classified into two types: binding regulation ( e.g. ,  protein, ion, DNA, enzyme and ATP) and activity

regulation ( e.g. , transcription factor, kinase activity,  gated channel and ox ido reductase).  

# KEGG analysis of enrichment pathways  

KEGG analyses of top   $10\,\mathrm{DE}$   exo-miRs showed that the  top 30 enrichment pathways were mainly associated  with metabolic pathways, environmental information/  genetic information processing ( e.g. , endocytosis,  signaling pathways of PI3K-Akt, MAPK and Ras, and  protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, etc),  metabolism-related diseases ( e.g. , T2D, non-alcoholic  fatty liver disease, and insulin resistance, etc), and  organismal systems ( e.g. , insulin signaling pathway,  platelet activation, and Toll-like receptor signaling  pathway, etc), as shown in Figure 4.  

# Target interact ome network of top 10 DE exo-miRs  

Using combined score greater than   $>\,0.9$   as threshold  cutoff, a miRs/gene and gene/gene interaction network  was consisted of 10 exo-miRs and 65 CTGs, regulated  by differently regulated exo-miRs among increased Apo  B serum levels   $(\geq~80~\mathrm{~mg/dL})$  ) subjects with GG  genotype of rs11046182, as shown in Figure 5. The  highly correlated CTGs were as follows: ATP binding  cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), carnitine  palm i to yl transfer as e 1A (CPT1A), cytochrome b(558)  subunit beta [CYBB, also NADPH oxidase 2  (NOX2)], hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α),  jagged 1 (JAG1), Notch homolog 1 (translocationassociated)  (Notch1),  peroxisome  pro life rat oractivated receptor-gamma co activator-1alpha (PGC1α), peroxisome pro life rat or-activated receptor-alpha  (PPARα), 6-ph os ph of ruc to-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2), and solute carrier family 2  member 1 [SLC2A1, also called glucose transporter 1  (GLUT1)], etc.  

# DISCUSSION  

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first  comprehensive  study  to  examine  the  possible  associations of  KATP  SNPs with elevated Apo B serum  concentration   $(\geq80~\mathrm{mg/FL}$   [11]) and ASCVD in south  China. The data indicate that the GG genotype of  rs11046182 was only linked to increased risk (about  increased by 1.17-fold) of elevated Apo B serum levels  rather than the other types of serum lipid disorder ( e.g. ,  TRIG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C or (and) Apo AI,  Supplementary Tables 3–7). The effects were not

related to the other   $3~K A T P$    variants ( e.g. , rs78148713,  rs145456027 and rs147265929). Interestingly, in this  study there was no significant difference on body mass  index (BMI), SBP, P2hBS, hypersensitive C-reactive  protein (HsCRP) in subjects with or without higher Apo  B serum levels   $(\geq80~\mathrm{mg/dL})$  ) (Table 1), but its average  levels of BMI   $(>\:24.0\:\:\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$  , SBP   $(>\,130\,\mathrm{\mmHg})$  ,  P2hBS   $(>7.8\;\mathrm{mmol/L})$  ), HsCRP   $(>3\;\mathrm{mg/L})$  ) were higher  than normal especially in higher Apo B level group,  which was also complicated with higher serum levels of  TRIG, TC and LDL-C. On the other hand, subjects with  GG genotype of  KATP  rs11046182 were indeed related  to higher serum levels of P2hBS and HsCRP besides  high Apo B serum levels (Supplementary Table 8). It is  suggesting that high Apo B serum level participants  with GG genotype of  KATP  rs11046182 sustain a status  

of metabolic disorders and inflammation. Insulin  resistance (IR) acts a major role in the pathogen es is of  this process. Indeed, a previous study reported that  KATP  rs5219 was correlated with IR [12]. The loci also  act an important role in process of glucose-induced  insulin secretion among Turks [13] as well as the other  two   $K A T P$   variants (rs1799854 and rs1799859), the  effect was not existed in Caribbeans (rs5219) [14] and

Poles (rs1799854) [8]. On the other hand, blood lipid  disorder is heterogeneous disease characterized by  irregular levels of serum lipids and lipoprotein s. Our  findings are partially accordant with some similar  studies. KATP rs1799854 (TT genotype) was linked to  higher serum HDL level among non-diabetic patients in  Nigeria as well as lower serum levels of TG, TC and  LDL [4]. KATP rs1799854 and rs1799859 were linked  to increased TRIG serum level among Croatia diabetic  patients receiving s ulf ony lure a treatment [5]. KATP  rs5219   $\scriptstyle(\mathrm{KK+EW}$   genotype) was correlated with higher  TC/HDL-C ratio among young Chinese Han people  with pre diabetes [6]. These findings indicated that  KATP rs11046182 could be a latent genetic predisposition marker for elevated Apo B serum levels for  Southern Chinese.  

Cholesterol-rich, Apo B-containing lipoprotein s are  now widely accepted as the most important causal  agents of ASCVD [15]. CAS no less than  $50\%$   is known

as a new subtype of ASCVD besides acute myocardial  infarction (AMI) and stroke [16]. In this study we  further found that subjects carrying with GG genotype  (the high Apo B risk genotype) of rs11046182 were also  linked to moderate risk (about a 0.63-fold increase) of   $\mathrm{CAS}\ \geq\ 50\%$   at studying enrollment, and further  correlated with high risk (about a 1.24-fold increase) of  new-onset IS after median follow-up of 50.6-months.  These findings are partially accordant with the other  related studies that found that   $K A T P$    rs61688134 was  associated with AMI among Italians [7] while   $K A T P$  rs1799854 was with stroke in diabetic Polish [8]. These  results suggest that   $K A T P$    rs11046182 may be an  optimal marker of elevated risk of Apo B related  ASCVD.  

The interplay between genetic and environment factors  causes the development of dys lipid emi a and related  ASCVD. The circulating exo-miRs, as bridge that links  genetic and environment factors, play an essential effect  in physiological or pathological processes from elevated  Apo B level to ASCVD. However, the expression  profile of exo-miRs in biological process from genotype  ( KATP  rs11046182) to phenotype (Apo  $\mathrm{B}\geq80~\mathrm{mg/CL}$  )  is still largely unclear. Our results firstly characterized  the circulating expression profile of exo-miRs (Table 4)  among increased Apo B level subjects with the two  genotypes of  KATP  rs11046182. Synchronously, studies  had shown that those DE exo-miRs played a crucial  effect in development of arteriosclerosis ( e.g. , miR-17- 3p [17], miR-22-3p [18], miR-490-3p [19], miR-193  family [20], miR-320 family [21] and miR-378 family  [22], etc), involving in endo the li al cells dysfunction,  vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and  migration, plaque ang io genesis, apoptosis, autophagy  and macrophage lipid deposition. Many studies showed  that miR-31-5p [23], miR-210-3p [24] and miR-208  family [25] were significantly associated with the  stenosis degree of at hero sclerotic plaques as well as  unstable phenotype, suggesting that these exo-miRs  could be correlated with the potential cardiovascular  events risk. Our findings were in favor of recent  observations that reported the DE miRs ( e.g. , miR-17- 5p [26], miR-210 [27], miR-218 [28], miR-422a [29],  miR-497 [30], miR-4429 [31], miR-208 family [25],  miR-320 family [31] and miR-378 family [32]) in  patients with IS, and part of them could be as markers  for an early diagnosis of stroke. In a 4-year prospective  study for identifying the markers of CAS related IS,  Gacon J et al. [25] reported that elevated miR-208b-3p  level were obviously linked to cerebral ischaemic  events risk. This finding was accordant with the  investigation by Jin F et al. [28] who reported that miR378 and miR-218 were independent predicting factors  for the severity in patients with acute IS. Further, the  plasma level of miR-210 [33] was related to a  worsening prognosis of stroke while miR-17 to future  stroke recurrence [34]. Under the genetic condition of  KATP  rs11046182, these exo-miRs ( e.g. , miR-17-3p,  miR-22-3p, miR-31-5p, miR-134-5p, miR-210-3p, miR490-3p, miR-208 family, miR-320 family and miR-378  family) run through the whole pathological processes  from the accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors  ( e.g. , smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet,  obesity and aging) to the occurrence of at hero scleroticrelated events and even death. In addition, there were  another four exo-miRs as follows: miR-1291, miR-4488,  miR-4726-5p, and miR-7704. However, the relationships of the 4 exo-miRs with cardiovascular disease are  still unknown, needing further research.  

To further evaluate the roles of exo-miRs under  interaction between genetic and environment factors,  GO and KEGG analysis for the top 10 DE exo-miRs  related 1156 CTGs were carried out among elevated  Apo   $\mathrm{\DeltaB\;\geq\;80\;\ m g/d L}$   subjects with GG genotype of  rs11046182. GO analyses (Figure 3) showed that  enrichment of CTAs acted pivotal roles in BP, CC and  MF, accordant with a regulatory role for these exo-miRs  in the processes of transcription and translation [35] on  dys lipid emi a and related ASCVD. KEGG pathways  analyses (Figure 4) showed that metabolic pathways,  PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and endocytosis were the  three most significant differential ly regulated pathways.  In particular, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which acts a  principal role in regulating growth factor signals ( e.g. ,  glucose/lipid/protein metabolism, etc) under disease  status ( e.g. , obesity and T2D) [36]. These results  suggested that those DE exo-miRs might act a key  effect in elevated Apo B serum levels and its induced  ASCVD by regulating these 3 pathways, especially  PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.  

# Strengths and limitations  

The major advantage of the research was firstly evaluate  the associations of   $K A T P$   mutations with the risk of  increased Apo B concentration   $(\geq~80~\mathrm{\meg/dL})$   and  ASCVD in South China, and characterize the  circulating expression profile of exo-miRs under  interplay status between genetic (KATP variants) and  environmental (elevated Apo B serum levels) factors,  intimating that the possible epigenetic modification  effect of exo-miRs in development of dys lipid emi a and  its related at hero sclerotic vascular events. The major  disadvantages of the study were as follows: Firstly, due  to the sample size   $\mathrm{(N{=}1044)}$  , large-scale subgroup  analysis based on Apo B serum level   $(<80~\mathrm{mg/CL}$   vs.  $\geq$   $80~\mathrm{mg/dL})$  ) and genotypes (GG vs.   $\mathrm{AA}+\mathrm{CA})$   of  $K A T P$  rs11046182 will help to further verify the hypothesis  that the occurrence and development of increased Apo  B serum concentration and its related ASCVD arises  from  complex  interaction  between  genetic  and  environment factors. Secondly, Bonferroni correction  was executed to correct significance thresholds, but  false-positive results may still occur. Thirdly, a  rudimentary bioinformatics analysis was only executed,  and the non-specific effect and miss-distance effect may  exist, owing to lack of verification at the cellular and  molecular levels. Therefore, the results of the study  should be interpreted carefully.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

KATP  rs11046182 was correlated with increased risks  of elevated serum Apo B concentration   $(\geq80~\mathrm{mg/dL})$  )  and ASCVD, suggesting that this variant is a  prospective clinical translational target for precision  prevention and early-detection strategies for those  disorders, and needs further verification by prospective  studies with large sample sizes in different ethnic  populations. The potential molecular regulatory may be  involved in these significantly DE exo-miRs (especially  the top 10 DE exo-miRs) and metabolic related  pathways (especially PI3K-Akt pathway) under those  cross-talk status, warrant further research.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Study subjects  

The ethics approval (K-2017-043-02) of this study was  granted from Guangzhou First People’s Hospital, South  China University of Technology. The present study was  conducted in consistent with the Helsinki Declaration  and the ethics guidelines of the institutional. A total of  522 participants with increased Apo B serum levels   $(\geq$     $80~\mathrm{mg/dL})$   and 522 counterpart subjects   $(<80~\mathrm{mg/dL})$  )  were enrolled to the research from South China. All  participants with blood lipid disorder were newly  identified referring to guidelines [11] as follows:  increased serum concentrations of Apo B   $(\geq80\;\mathrm{mg/dL})$  ,  TRIG   $\mathrm{\left(\geq~1.7~\mmol/L\right)}$  , TC   $(\geq5.2\,\mathrm{\mmol{/L}})$  ) or (and)  LDL-C   $\left(\ge~1.4~\mathrm{\mmol/L}\right)$  ), and (or) decreased serum  concentrations of apo lipoprotein AI (Apo AI)   $(<\,120$     $\mathrm{mg/dL})$   and HDL-C   $(<\ 1.0\ \mathrm{mmol/L})$  ). The combined  medical conditions including essential hypertension 

 (EH) [37], coronary at hero sclerotic heart disease (CAD) 

 [38], atrial fibrillation (AF) [39] or (and) type 2 diabetes  mellitus (T2D) [40] were also evaluated referring to  relevant guidelines. Potential participants were excluded  from the study if they had if they had (1) past history of  stroke or transient ischemic attack, (2) Elevated levels   $^{>3}$   times upper limit of normal) of aspartate  amino transfer as e (AST) and alanine amino transfer as e  (ALT), (3) decreased level   $(\mathrm{<}90\mathrm{pm1/min}^{}1.73\ \mathrm{~m}^{2})$   of  estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), (4) or (and)  any other medical disorders or drugs that could result in  kinds of dys lipid emi a as mentioned above. Participant’s  medical records were assembled via interviewing  patient himself and physicians as well as reviewing of  medical records. Standard analytical methods were  performed to assess blood biochemical indexes on  admission to the study. Bilateral carotid ultrasound was  executed on enrollment to the study referring to relevant  recommendations [41].  

# Genotyping assay  

Four  KATP  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ( e.g. rs11046182, rs78148713, rs145456027 and rs147265929)  were genotyped with the MassARRAY (Sequenom)  system as previously described methods [42]. Primer  software (Version 5.0, Cambridge, USA) was used to  design the specific primers for the 4  KATP  variants based  on the  KATP  gene sequence information in GenBank  (NC_000012.12:g.21768149G>A;  NC_000012.12:g.  21777582T>C; NC_000012.11:g.21943896T>C; NC_  000011.10:g.17391521T>G) (Supplementary Table 1).  The specific primers of  KATP  SNPs were composited by  Invitrogen (Guangzhou, China). The SNPs determination  accuracy was   $100\%$   for each variant of  KATP .  

# Endpoint  

Primary follow-up end-point was new-onset IS. All  stroke subjects were survivors of IS, and determined   by magnetic resonance image and/or computed  tomography scanning of the brain referring to relevant  guidelines [43]. Subjects were recruited to the study on  the date of initial evaluation for increased Apo B serum  levels   $(\geq\,80\,\mathrm{\mg/dL})$   since first medical examination.   IS-free event survival time was defined as the time from  the enrollment date to the date of initial evaluation for  IS or last follow-up. The date of final follow-up was  Dec 31, 2019. The median follow-up time was 50.6  (range: 43.5-58.7) months.  

# Identification of exo-miRs expression profile  

Another total of 10 participants from South China with  only elevated serum Apo B concentration   $(\geq80~\mathrm{mg/dL})$  )  were newly enrolled to the study (the baseline  characteristics was shown in Table 5). Participants with  other types of serum lipid disorder were ruled out from  the study as described above. All participants combined  with smoking, drinking, EH, CAD, AF, T2D, IS,  abnormal liver/kidney function, or (and) any other  medical disorders or drugs that could result in kinds of  dys lipid emi a were also excluded from the study as  described above. Then, the exo-miRs expression profile  was analyzed according to our previous method with  minor modifications [44], including blood sample  collection, isolation exosomes from plasma, extraction  RNA from exosomes, exo-miRs sequencing, and  analysis of sequencing data (detail information was  presented in methods section of Supplementary  Material). In particular, exo-miRs sequencing was  executed at Ribobio Co. (Guangzhou, China) with  Illumina HiSeq2500 with single-end 50bp (Illumina,  Carlsbad, USA).   $_{3^{\prime}}$   adapter sequence is:   $5^{\circ}$  -AGATCGG  A A GAG CACA CGT CT $\cdot3^{\bullet}$  .   $5^{\prime}$   adapter sequence is:   $5^{\circ}$  - G TTC A GAG TTC TACA GT CCG A CG ATC-3’. The novel  exo-miRs discovery was performed using miRDeep2  based on miRBase21 ( http://www.mirbase.org ).  

# Statistical analysis  

The SPSS software (version 24, SPSS Co., USA) was  used for statistical analyses. The Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium was evaluated for control subjects as shown  in Supplementary Table 2. Continuous variables were  presented as mean   $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$   while categorical variables  were as number (percentage). The independent-samples  t-test is used to analyze continuous variables. The  $\chi^{2}$   test  was carried out to evaluate the associations between   $K A T P$   variants and those categorical variables. Binary  logistic regression analysis was executed to analyze the  associations of   $K A T P$   variants with these types of serum  lipid disorder as well as   $\mathrm{CAS}~\geq~50\%$  , Bonferroni  correction was carried out to adjust the probability of  type I error (false positive). The Cox proportional  hazards regression model was carried out to access the  crude hazard ratios (HRs) for event free analysis of  new-onset IS, adjusted HRs and their   $95\%$   confidence  intervals (CIs) with corrections for potential covariates.  A   $P$   value   $<\ 0.05$   is statistically significant. All  probabilities are two-tailed.  

The differential ly expressed (DE) exo-miRs in  increased Apo B levels   $(\geq\ 80\ \mathrm{\meg/dL})$  ) subjects with  different genotypes (GG vs.   $_\mathrm{\AA+GAA})$   of rs11046182  were analyzed with edgeR software referring to the  criteria of |log2 (Fold Change)| no less than 1 and   $P$  value less than 0.05. Gene Ontology (GO) category and  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)  pathway enrichment were analyzed with the Fisher’s  exact test and   $\chi^{2}$   test, and followed by false discovery  rate (FDR) correction. A corrected   $P$   value   $<\,0.05$   was  performed to choose significant GO categories and  KEGG pathways.

# Supplementary Method  

# Carotid and cardiac ultra sonography  

Bilateral carotid and cardiac ultrasonic scanning was  performed when patients admitted to the study. The near  and far walls of bilateral common carotid artery,  bifurcations, and   $1\;\mathrm{{cm}}$   of the internal and external carotid  arteries were scanned for the presence of carotid  arteriosclerosis stenosis   $(\mathrm{CAS})~\geq~50\%$   (recorded as   the average of measurements by two independent  experienced physicians according to the measurement of  stenosis degree used in the North American Symptomatic  Carotid End art erect o my Trial [1]) with a   $3/9\ \mathrm{MHz}$   ultrawideband linear array transducer (iU22, Philips, NL).  The left atrial end-diastolic dimension (LAD), left  ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVD), right atrial enddiastolic dimension (RAD), right ventricular enddiastolic diameter (RVD), and left ventricular ejection  fraction (LVEF) were measured using M-mode or   two-dimensional echo car dio graph y in the para stern al  long-axis view at the end-ventricular systole with a  1.7/3.4 MHz linear array transducer (Vivid 7, GE  Healthcare, USA) over 4 cardiac cycles according to  recommendations for chamber quant if i cation from the  American Society of Echo car dio graph y [2].  

# Sample collection in plasma exosome-derived miRs  (exo-miRs) expression profiling analyses  

Peripheral venous whole-blood samples were collected  into anti coagulation tube with EDTA   $(3\,\mathrm{\meg/mL})$   on  enrollment, but after a 12-hours fasting and a light, lowfat meal the night. All tubes were centrifuged within an  hour from collection at   $3000\mathrm{g}$   (Eppendorf 5810R  centrifuge, Germany) for 5 minutes at   $4^{\circ}\mathrm{~C~}$   to separate  plasma and cellular components. Hemolysis was  assessed according to the previously reported method,  and hemolyzed samples were excluded from the  experimental workflow.  

# Isolation of exosomes from plasma  

The upper plasma phase was carefully transferred to a  new tube with conical bottom without disturbing the  intermediate buffy coat layer and centrifuged for   $15~\mathrm{min}$    at   $3000\times\mathrm{~g~}$   for   $10\,\mathrm{\min}$   at   $4^{\circ}\mathrm{~C~}$   to remove additional  cellular fragments and debris. The cleared super nat ant  was carefully transferred to a new tube without  disturbing the pellet, which forms a smear along the  bottom of the cent ri fuga tion tube. Then, the plasma was  passed through a   $0.22\substack{\mathrm{-}\upmu\mathrm{m}}$   filter to remove larger  extracellular vesicles, aliquoted, and stored at   $\mathrm{-}80^{\circ}~\mathrm{C}$  .  Exosomes from pre filtered plasma were isolated with  exoEasy Maxi kit (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany;  Catalog No. 76064) according to the manufacturer’s  protocol with modifications described in Stranska et al.  [3]. Briefly,   $2~\mathrm{ml}$   buffer XBP was added to   $2\;\mathrm{{ml}}$   plasma  and mixed well by gently inverting the tube five times.  Then, the sample/XBP mix was added onto the exoEasy  spin column and centrifuged at   $500\times\mathrm{g}$   for 1 min. The  flow-through was discarded and the column was placed  back into the same collection tube. After that,   $10\,\mathrm{\milde{l}}$    buffer XWP was added to the column and centrifuged at   $3000\times\mathrm{g}$   for   $5~\mathrm{min}$   to remove any residual buffer from  the column. The flow-through along with the collection  tube was discarded and the spin column was transferred  to a new collection tube. Next,   $400~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   buffer XE was  added to the membrane and incubated for   $1~\operatorname*{min}$  ,  followed by centrifuging at   $500\times\mathrm{g}$   for   $5~\mathrm{min}$   to collect  the eluate. Finally, the eluate was re-applied to the  exoEasy spin column membrane and incubated for 1  min and then centrifuged at   $5000\times\mathrm{g}$   for  $5~\mathrm{min}$   to collect  the eluate.  

# Extraction RNA from exosomes  

Exosomal RNA was extracted by HiPure Liquid  miRNA Kit/HiPure Serum/Plasma miRNA Kit (Megan,  China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  RNA purity was assessed using NanoDrop-1000  (Thermo Fisher, CA, USA). Each RNA sample had an  A260:A280 ratio above 1.8 and A260:A230 ratio above  2.0. The quantity and integrity of Exosomal RNA yield  was assessed by using the Qubit ®  2.0 (Life  Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Agilent 2200  Tape Station  (Agilent  Technologies,  CA,  USA)  separately.  

# Exo-miRs sequencing  

Exo-miRs sequencing was performed using Illumina  platforms (Illumina, Carlsbad, USA) at Ribobio Co.  (Guangzhou, China). Briefly, RNAs (50ng Exosomal  RNA of each sample) were ligated with 3’RNA adapter  and followed by 5’adapter ligation. Subsequently, the  adapter-ligated RNAs were subjected to RT-PCR and  amplified with a low-cycle. Then the PCR products  were size selected by PAGE gel according to  instructions of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library  Prep Set for Illumina (New England Biolabs, MA,  USA). The purified Exo-miRs library products were  evaluated using the Agilent 2200 Tape Station and  diluted to   $10\;\mathrm{pmol/L}$   for cluster generation in situ on the 

  $\mathrm{SiSeq}2500$   single-end flow cell followed by sequencing 

  $(1\times50{\mathrm{~\mathsf{b}}}{\mathsf{p}})$  ) on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. Raw  data (raw reads) in fastq format were pre processed to  trim   $_3,$   and 5’adapters, and then, the low-quality reads  were filtered out to obtain clean reads. By classifying  the clean reads, the components and expression  information of all types of small RNAs, including miRs,  in the sample can be obtained.The miRs expression  levels were estimated by the number of reads per  million  (RPM)  using  the  following  formula:   $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{norm}}=$  (number of reads mapping to microRNA/number  of reads in clean data)  $\times10^{6}$  .  

# Sequencing data analysis  

The raw reads were processed by filtering out containing  adapter, poly   ${\bf\Psi},{\bf N}'$  , low quality, smaller than 17nt reads by  FASTQC to get clean reads. Mapping reads were  obtained by mapping clean reads to reference genome   of by BWA. The miRDeep2 was used to identify   known  mature  exo-miRs  based  on  miRBase21  ( http://www.mirbase.org ) and predict novel exo-miRs.  Databases of Rfam12.1 ( https://rfam.xfam.org ) and  pirnabank ( http://pirnabank.ibab.ac.in ) were used to  identify rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and piRNA by  BLAST. The exo-miRs expression were calculated by  RPM (reads per million) values. The expression levels  were normalized by RPM, RPM is equal to (number of  reads mapping to miRs/number of reads in clean data)   $\times10^{6}$  . Exo-miRs differential expression in subjects with  between two genotypes of rs1799858 was calculated   by edgeR algorithm according to the criteria of |log2  (Fold Change)|  $\geq\,1$   and   $P$   value   $<\ 0.05.$  .The miRDB,  miRTarBase, miRWalk and TargetScan were used to  predict targets gene of selected exo-miRs. KOBAS was  used to further Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis.
