Background:  Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most serious cardiovascular events associated with high risk of  death or disability. The growing body of evidence highlights molecular chaperones as especially important  players in the pathogen es is of the disease. Since six small proteins called  “ Hero ”  have been recently identified as  a novel class of chaperones we aimed to evaluate whether SNP rs4644832 in  SERF2  gene encoding the member of  Hero-proteins, is associated with the risk of IS.  Methods:  A total of 1929 unrelated Russians (861 patients with IS and 1068 healthy individuals) from Central  Russia were recruited into the study. Genotyping was done using a probe-based PCR approach. Statistical  analysis was carried out in the whole group and stratified by age, gender and smoking status.  Results:  Analysis of the link between rs4644832  SERF2  and IS showed that G allele is the risk factor of IS only in  females (  $\mathrm{{mathopen}}_{}$  ,  $95\%{\mathrm{CI}}$   1.02 – 1.64, Padj  $\mathord{=}0.035$  ). In addition, the analysis of associations of rs4644832  SERF2  and IS depending on the smoking status revealed that this genetic variant is associated with an increased risk of  IS exclusively in non-smoking individuals (  $\mathrm{{>}O R=}1.26$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$   1.01 – 1.56,   $\mathsf{P}=0.041$  ).  Discussion:  Sex- and smoking interactions between rs4644832 polymorphism and IS may be related to the impact  of tobacco components metabolism and sex hormones on  SERF2  expression.  Conclusion:  The present study reveals the novel genetic association between rs4644832 polymorphism and the  risk of IS suggesting that SERF2, the part of the protein quality control system, contributes to the pathogen es is of  the disease.  

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS) is a life-threatening diagnosis dramatically  increasing risk of death and leading to disability in the adult population  ( Meschia and Brott, 2018 ). In the vast majority of cases IS is caused by  thrombosis following the rapture of the at hero sclerotic plaque ( Camp­ bell et al., 2019 ). Study of the mechanisms underlying these events may  help to improve approaches for the prediction, prevention and the  treatment of the disease ( Polonikov et al., 2022; Bushueva et al., 2021;  Malik et al., 2018; Vialykh et al., 2012; Bushueva et al., 2015b ). There  are multiple molecular pathways driving the development and outcomes  of at hero sclerotic plaque in cerebral arteries ( Libby, 2021 ). Foremost,  these pathways are linked to cholesterol turnover, vascular wall  inflammation and platelets aggregation ( Rahman and Woollard, 2017;  K out s a liar is et al., 2022 ). Accordingly, major research has been focused  on the certain molecular contributors such as lipoprotein s, cytokines  and their receptors as well as proteins involved in coagulation and  platelets dynamic.  

IS is a multi factorial disease with multiple genes involved. Associa­ tion studies of the last decades revealed a broadest spectrum of genetic  markers associated with IS ( Appunni et al., 2022; Ilinca et al., 2019;  Zhang et al., 2022 ), and related disorders such as arterial hypertension  ( Bushueva, 2020; Bushueva et al., 2015a ) and atherosclerosis ( Sorokin  et al., 2015; Sorokin et al., 2016a; Sorokin et al., 2016b; Bushueva et al.,  2015c ) leading to the new insights in their pathogen es is.  

Maintaining proteins is one of the top priority tasks for the cell.  Accordingly, chaperones, molecules undergoing the proteins quality  control, are the key factors involved in cellular homeostasis. Substantial  body of evidence suggests that chaperones serve as important links in  genesis and course of IS ( Hwang et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2012 ). For  instance, an imbalance of the 70-kDa heat shock proteins was reported  to impede endo the li al function ( Costa-Beber et al., 2022 ). Moreover, on  pre clinical models, modulators of several molecular targets have been  tested in various cardiovascular disorders with promising results  ( Diteepeng et al., 2021 ).  

We set out to investigate whether a recently discovered class of  chaperones, so-called  “ Hero-proteins ” , may impact the risk of IS. In  brief, Hero is a family of chaperones comprising 6 small heat-resistant  proteins. These proteins were shown to protect enzymes from drying,  organic solvents and other damaging factors exposed  in vitro  ( Tsu­ boyama et al., 2020 ). Moreover, some of these proteins also prevented  pathological protein aggregation in neural cells during experimental  neuro degeneration. Given the critical role of chaperons in atheroscle­ rotic plaque development ( Xu et al., 2012 ) and cellular response to  hypoxia ( Thiebaut et al., 2019 ), the Hero proteins may be considered as  probable contributors to the risk of IS.  

We tested this hypothesis via the analysis of association between the  polymorphism of  SERF2  gene encoding a member of the Hero proteins  and IS risk in the adult Russian population.  

# Material and methods  

A total of 1929 unrelated Russians (861 patients with IS and 1068  healthy individuals) from Central Russia were recruited into the study.  

Table 1  Baseline and clinical characteristics of the studied groups.   
![](images/c134cc64475ef49030f17e9e25cd6b3b1f4a3a4adc0a9a8b3e89cd5655e3a890.jpg)  

The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration  of Helsinki, and was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of  Kursk State Medical University, Russia (Protocol No. 12 from  7.12.2015). All the participants gave written informed consent before  the enrollment in this study, subject to the following inclusion criteria:  self-declared Russian descent, a birthplace inside of Central Russia.  

Baseline and clinical characteristics of the study population are listed  in  Table 1 . The patients were enrolled into the study in two periods: from  the Regional Vascular Center of Kursk Regional Clinical Hospital be­ tween 2015 and 2017 and from the Neurology Clinics of Kursk Emer­ gency Medicine Hospital Kursk between 2010 and 2012. All the patients  were examined by qualified neurologists. The diagnosis of IS was made  in the acute phase of stroke, according to the results of the neurological  examination and computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance  imaging of the brain. The patients were recruited consecutively. The IS  patients were enrolled under the following exclusion criteria: hepatic or  renal failure or endocrine, autoimmune, on co logical, or other diseases  that can cause an acute cerebro vascular event; intra cerebral hemor­ rhage, he mo dynamic or dissection-related stroke, traumatic brain  injury. All the patients with IS had a history of hypertension and  received anti hypertensive therapy. Due to the fact that in the studied  cohort there were patients with concomitant comorbid pathology, we  conducted an additional differential analysis of the baseline and clinical  characteristics in subgroups of patients, depending on the presence /  absence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus  (T2DM) ( Table S1 ).  

The control group was compiled from healthy volunteers with no  clinical evidence of cerebro vascular, cardiovascular, or other chronic  diseases and with normal blood pressure without anti hypertensive  therapy. Healthy individuals were included in the control group if they  had a systolic blood pressure less than   $130~\mathrm{mm~Hg}$   and/or a diastolic  blood pressure less than  $85\,\mathrm{mm\,Hg}$   on at least 3 separate measurements.  Control subjects were enrolled from Kursk hospitals during periodic  medical examinations at public institutions and industrial enterprises of  the Kursk region. This group was recruited from the same population  and during the same period.  

The following criteria were used in the selection of SNPs: the SNP  must be tagging, have a minor allele frequency of at least 0.05 in the  European population and be characterized by a high regulatory poten­ tial. According to the bio in format ic tool SNPinfo Web Server (https://  snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/snptag.html), which was used to select  SNPs based on the reference haplotypic structure of the Caucasian  population (CEU) of the project HapMap, the only tag SNP in the gene  SERF2  (small EDRK-rich factor 2, ID:10169) is rs4644832.  

This genetic variant is localized in the intron. Several bio in format ic  resources were used to assess the regulatory potential of this SNP to  justify the selection of this genetic variant according to the study in­ clusion criteria. According to SNPinfo Web Server and the search query 

 “ SNP Function Prediction ”  this SNP possess the high regulatory potential 

  $(\mathtt{R P{=}0.403})$  ) and is localized within transcription factors binding site 

 (https://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/snpfunc.html) (accessed on 8  October 2022) ( Xu and Taylor, 2009 ). According to rSNPBase  (http://rsnp.psych.ac.cn/index.do), rs4644832 is characterized by  proximal and distal regulation of transcription and RNA-binding pro­ teins-mediated regulation (accessed on 8 October 2022) ( Guo and Wang,  2018 ). The RegulomeDB tool showed that rs4644832  SERF2  is charac­ terized by a regulatory coefficient of 4 (TF binding   $^+$   DNase peak)  (http://regulome.stanford.edu/) (accessed on 8 October 2022) ( Dong  and Boyle, 2019 ). According to the data presented in the Ensembl  genome browser, this genetic variant is characterized by an average  frequency of the minor G allele in European populations of 0.18  (https://www.ensembl.org/). Thus, rs4644832  SERF2  was selected for  our research, which meets the necessary criteria for inclusion in the  study.  

# Genetic Analysis  

DNA analysis was carried out at the Research Institute for Genetic  and Molecular Epidemiology of Kursk State Medical University (Kursk,  Russia). Approximately   $5~\mathrm{mL}$   of venous blood from the cubital vein of  each participant was collected into EDTA-coated tubes and maintained  at   $20\ \circ\mathrm{C}$   until processed. Genomic DNA was extracted from thawed  − blood samples by the standard procedure of phenol/chloroform  extraction and ethanol precipitation. Genotyping of the SNP was done  using allele-specific probe-based real-time polymerase chain reaction  assays according to the protocol designed in the Laboratory of Genomic  Research, Research Institute for Genetic and Molecular Epidemiology.  Primers and probes were designed using the Primer3 program online  (http://primer3.ut.ee/) ( Koressaar and Remm, 2007 ), selected, and then  synthesized by the Syntol company (Moscow, Russia). The two primers  were  used  for  genotyping  of  the  polymorphism:  forward   $5^{\prime}$  -TT CCG TTC ACC CTA AAC ACC $\cdot3^{\prime}$  and  reverse   $5^{\prime}$  -AGGGTGG  T CCC GT GAA G TAG $\cdot3^{\prime}$    as well as two allele-specific probes   $5^{\prime}$  -FAM-CG  CT CT GT G GCC A CCC TC A-RTQ1 –  $\cdot3^{\prime}$  and   $5^{\prime}$  -ROX-CGC T CT GTA GCC  ACCCTCA-BHQ2 –  $\cdot3^{\prime}$  . A real-time PCR was done in a   ${\bf25}\mathrm{{-mL}}$   reaction  mixture containing   $1.5\;\mathrm{U}$   of Hot Start Taq DNA polymerase (Biolabmix,  Novosibirsk, Russia), about   $1\;\upmu g$   of DNA,   $0.25~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   each primer,   $250~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  dNTPs,  $3.0\,\mathrm{{mM\,M gCl_{2}}}$   $16.6\,\mathrm{mM}$   $\mathrm{(NH4)_{2}S O_{4}}$  ,   $0.01\%$   Tween-20]. The amplification reaction consisted of  an initial de natura tion for   $10~\mathrm{min}$   at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$   $92\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\,s$   and  $64\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 1 min.  Fig. S1  of supplementary shows allelic  discrimination plot for SNP rs4644832  SERF2  assay designed for this  study. To ensure quality control,  $10\%$   of DNA samples were genotyped  in duplicates blinded to the case-control status. The concordance rate  was  $>99\%$  .  

# Statistical and Bioinformatics Analysis  

All statistical analyses were performed in R software v3.6.3. The  distribution of quantitative data was tested for normality using Shapir­ o – Wilk ’ s test ( “ normtest ”  package) and variance equality was assessed  using Levene ’ s test ( “ lawstat ”  package). For quantitative variables, the  significance of the difference between means was determined using  Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test in case of pairwise comparison or Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test in case of multiply comparison. For categorical  variables, the statistical significance of differences was evaluated by  Pearson ’ s chi-squared test with Yates ’ s correction for continuity.  

Compliance of the genotypes ’  distribution with Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium was assessed using Fisher ’ s exact test. Genotype fre­ quencies in the study groups and their associations with the disease risk  were analyzed using SNPStats software (https://www.snpstats.net/  start.htm) ( Sole et al., 2006 ). For the analysis of associations of geno­ types, additive models were considered. Associations were adjusted for  age, gender and smoking status.  

The following bioinformatics resources were used to analyze the functional  effects of rs4644832 SERF2:

# Results  

rs4644832 is associated with IS risk in females and non-smokers  

The frequency of the minor allele G in Russians (0.156) was within  the range of frequencies for this allele in European populations from the  1000 Genomes Project, Phase 3 (http://www.ensembl.org (accessed on  11 October 2022): 0.154 – 0.222).  

The genotype frequencies of rs4644832  SERF2  in study groups are  presented in  Table 2 . The distribution of genotypes frequencies  corresponded to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group   $\left(\mathrm{P}>0.05\right)$  . However, patients with IS showed an increase in observed  he ter oz y gos it y   $(\mathrm{He}{=}0.3136)$  ) compared to expected (  $\scriptstyle({\mathrm{He}}=0.2877)$  );   $\mathrm{~P~}<$  0.01.  

The analysis of the total sample did not reveal significant associa­ tions between rs4644832 polymorphism  SERF2  and IS risk. However,  sex-stratified analysis demonstrated that G allele is the risk factor of IS in  females   $\mathrm{{_{0R=1.29}}}$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$   1.02 – 1.64,   $\mathbf{P}\,=\,\mathbf{0.035}$  ). Also, this genetic  variant was found to be associated with an increased risk of IS in non-smoking individuals (  $\mathrm{{OR}{=}1.26}$  ,  $95\%\mathrm{CI}$   1.01 – 1.56,  ${\bf P}={\bf0.041}$  ) ( Table 2 ).

Since the revealed association between the genetic polymorphism  and smoking-status may be biased by the d is equilibrium of proportion of  smokers between males and females we further performed a separated  analysis accounting both factors. The analysis has confirmed that  smoking-status has its own impact because we had found that the as­ sociation of G allele with the higher risk of IS in nonsmokers still took  place even after exclusion of males ( Table 3 ).  

Given the fact that patients with IS were characterized by differences  in clinical and laboratory characteristics depending on the presence of a  comorbid pathology (IHD/T2DM), there may be data bias in the results  of associations. Therefore, in order to understand the marker specificity  for IS, we considered comparison of the 3 patients ’  subgroups depending  on the presence/absence of other diseases: stroke patients without IHD  and T2DM, combination of stroke and CAD, stroke patients with T2DM  ( Tables S2-S4 ). Of note, we did not segregate a subgroup of stroke pa­ tients aggravated by both CHD and T2DM in the analysis due to the  small number of observations in this cohort. The association of  rs4644832 with the IS in non-smoking patients persisted after the  exclusion of stroke patients with comorbid IHD and T2DM. However,  the association of this genetic variant with IS in women was lost,  possibly due to a reduction in study power due to a decrease in the  number of patients by 207 people. We did not find associations of  rs4644832  SERF2  in the subgroups of patients with IHD and T2DM,  which is an additional justification for the specific association of  rs4644832  SERF2  with the IS development. On the other hand, the  number of stroke patients with comorbid IHD and T2DM was too small  to draw any conclusions about associations with genetic markers.  

# Molecular correlates of rs4644832 SERF2  

The  SERF2  gene is expressed in brain tissues, blood vessels, and  whole blood. In brain tissues, gene expression levels of  SERF2  measured  as median (Me) TPM (Transcripts Per Million) vary from 56.54 to 164.7;  in blood vessels  –  from 203.8 to 246.5; in whole blood MeTPM  $=$   153.5  ( Fig. 1 ).  

The protective A allele of rs4644832 up regulates  SERF2  expression  in blood vessels and in whole blood ( Table S5 ). This genetic variant  alters cis-eQTL-mediated regulation of the expression of 10 other genes  ( AC011330.5, ADAL, CATSPER2, CATSPER2P1, HYPK, MAP1A, PDIA3,  STRC, STRCP1, ZSCAN29 ) in the brain, blood vessels, and whole blood.  

Besides the others, the list of  SERF -regulated genes includes  HYPK  (Huntingtin Interacting Protein K), involved in negative regulation of  apoptosis and protein stabilization;  MAP1A  (Micro tubule Associated  Protein 1A),  PDIA3  (molecular chaperone that prevents the formation of  protein aggregates) ( Table S5 ).  

The SERF2 protein is associated with 20 functional partners, and 92  total links the most significant of which are SERF1A, ZNF706, SERF1B  ( Fig. 2 ). Together with SERF2, these proteins are involved in such  general biological processes as protein de stabilization (GO:0031648),  Padj  $=0.0002$  ; regulation of stem cell population maintenance  (GO:2000036),   $\mathrm{\bfpadj}{=}\ 0.02,$  ; amyloid fibril formation (GO:1990000),  Padj  $=0.04$   (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr).  

Subsequent analysis revealed a significant effect of rs4644832  SERF2  on histone modifications. This genetic variant is located in the region of  DNA binding to histone H3, characterized by mono-methyl ation at the  4th lysine residue of the histone H3 protein (H3K4me1) and marking  enhancers in Brain Hippocampus Middle, Brain Cingulate Gyrus, Cells  from peripheral blood, as well as tri-methyl ation at the 4th lysine res­ idue of the histone H3 protein (H3K4me3) and marking promoters in all  brain tissues represented by HaploReg (v4.1), and Cells from peripheral  blood. The effect of this histone mark is enhanced by acetyl ation of the  lysine residues at N-terminal position 27 of the histone H3 protein  (H3K27ac), marking enhancers in peripheral blood cells and all brain  tissues, as well as the acetyl ation at the 9th lysine residues of the histone  H3 protein (H3K9ac), marking promoters in blood cells and all brain  tissues, except Brain Hippocampus Middle ( Table 4 ).  

H3K4me1  –  mono-methyl ation at the 4th lysine residue of the his­ tone H3 protein; H3K4me3  –  tri-methyl ation at the 4th lysine residue of  the histone H3 protein; H3K9ac  –  the acetyl ation at the 9th lysine resi­ dues of the histone H3 protein; H3K27ac  –  acetyl ation of the lysine  residues at N-terminal position 27 of the histone H3 protein; Enh  –  histone modification in the enhancer region; Pro  –  histone modification  at the promoter region.  

According to the bio in format ic resource Cardiovascular Disease  Knowledge Portal (CVDKP, https://cvd.hugeamp.org), which combines  and analyzes the results of genetic associations of the largest consor­ tiums for the study of CVD, the protective allele A is associated with a  number of stroke-associated phenotypes ( Table 5 ).

# Discussion  

Preserving proteome quality is one of the primary tasks for the cell.  Recently described class of chaperones, Hero, obviously provides  important homeostatic functions and should be taken into account for its  role in pathogen es is of various path o logie s. Hero proteins were  discovered in 2020 as heat-resistant molecules responsible for  chaperone-like activity of the super nat ants collected from the boiled S2  or HEK293T cell cultures lysates ( Tsuboyama et al., 2020 ). Thorough  search for the nature of protein-preserving components of these boiled  super nat ants allowed identifying six proteins which were shown to  protect proteins under stress conditions and to prevent pathogenic  misfolded TDP-43 aggregations in cells. The authors also demonstrated  that the hallmarks of the novel class of chaperones were low molecular  weight, high polarity and charge, as well as disorganized structure. The  most obvious way to explain their chaperone activity is that because of  chemical properties they are able to physically screen client proteins.  

Since Hero-proteins had been demonstrated as substantial regulators  of pro teo stasis we aimed to investigate whether their member SERF2 is  involved in pathogen es is of IS. Previously, SERF2 was reported to  enhance poly glut amine,  $\upbeta$  -amyloid and   $\upalpha$  -Synuclein aggregation and to  contribute to amyloid pro teo toxicity ( van Ham et al., 2010; Falsone  et al., 2012; Merle et al., 2019 ). Moreover, brain-specific  Serf2  knockout  mice, though viable, appear to be more prone to deposition of amyloids,  and show modified fibril morphology ( Stroo et al., 2021 ). Whole-body  knockouts are per in a tally lethal due to an apparently unrelated devel­ opmental issue ( Cleverley et al., 2021 ). A number of works reported that  SERF2 interacts with a wide spectrum of RNA molecules, however the  physiological significance or specificity of this interaction is unclear at  this time ( Sahoo and Bardwell, 2022 ).  

Here, providing genetic evidence that rs4644832 is associated with  IS risk, we report  SERF2  is involved in pathogen es is of stroke. Probably,  the role of  SERF2  in IS may be related to some of its protective functions  because disease-causing allele G was shown to decrease  SERF2  expres­ sion. In respect of main causes of IS these protective effects are most  likely related to the role of  SERF2  in the cardiovascular system. This  assumption is further enhanced by previous findings confirming corre­ lation between rs4644832 polymorphism and different cardiovascular  phenotypes. For instance, CDKP demonstrates that protective A allele is  associated with a decrease in Diastolic blood pressure (Bet  $\mathbf{a}{=}{-}0.0152$  ,   $\mathbf{P}=7.96\times10^{-10})$  , Systolic blood pressure (  $\mathtt{3e t a}{=}{-0.0074}$  ,  ${\bf P}=0.001$  )  as well as with a risk of Arterial hypertension   $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{OR}}=0.9894$  ,  ${\bf P}=0.02$  )  ( Table 5 ).  

Despite it seems difficult to separate the impact of rs4644832 on the  risk of IS or of other related cardiovascular diseases, we report that  genetic association remains significant even after excluding IHD and DM  type 2 patients. Nevertheless, all the patients had confirmed arterial  hypertension in anamnesis. Thus, bio in format ic analysis and our results  indicate that this genetic variant may play a significant role in the rise of  hypertension  –  the most important factor contributing to IS risk. Dif­ fe rent i ation of rs4644832 contribution to isolated arterial hypertension  is one of the main limitations in the present study and should be  considered the task for further research. We also have to note that  another limitation of our research is missing values of some clinical  parameters in a certain number of patients ( Table 1 ,  Table S1 ) due to the  retrospective type of the study.  

Additionally, CDKP shows that rs4644832 A allele is protective for  Elevated heart rate (B  $\mathtt{i e t a}{=}{-0.0915}$  ,   $\mathbf{P}=2.04\times\!10^{-4})$   and Peripheral  artery disease (  $\mathrm{{OR}}{=}0.95$  ,   ${\bf P}=0.03)$  ). Elevated heart rate increases the  risk of atrial fibrillation acting as another significant risk factor for  card i oem boli c type of IS. Notably, CDKP data also indicates A allele to  have a protective role in peripheral artery disease  –  path o genetically  related cardiovascular pathology. Noteworthy, all these associations are  concordant to pretty high levels of  SERF2  expression in cardiovascular  system, however precise molecular avenues of  SERF2  involvement in the  listed phenotypes are yet to be understood in details. Obviously, of the  main mechanisms, chaperone-like or RNA-binding activity should be  considered first.  

Revealed sensitivity to mutation for only women and non-smokers  may be theoretically related to abolishment of protective effects of the  A allele for males and smokers who are more prone to cardiovascular  diseases. However, previous data show that in contract to estrogens  ( Gertz et al., 2012 ) tobacco components ( Takami et al., 2007; Jiang  et al., 2017; Gonzalez-Rivera et al., 2020 ) and androgens ( Be re keto g lu  et al., 2021 ) serve positive regulators of  SERF2  expression making a hint  that these sex/smoking-gene relationships may still be explained by  cellular effects of SERF2 only. Taking together our data suggest that  SERF2  has a protective role because the factors increasing its expression  (male sex, smoking, A allele) decrease the risk of IS. Moreover, our  previous results showing correlation between rs2900262 polymorphism  of another Hero gene  –  C9ORF16  with IS only in smoking individuals  also match this tendency because components of cigarette smoke, on the  contrary, reduce the expression of  C9ORF16  ( Kobzeva et al., 2022 ).  

Interestingly, in an attempt to bridge  SERF2  function and IS we have  found that of the genes influenced by eQTL effects of rs4644832 none  had previously been shown to correlate with cardiovascular phenotypes.  However, it turned out that some of them possess great impact for  neuro degeneration and protein quality control. For instance,  MAP1A,  regulative by rs4644832, encodes a neuro specific protein which is  known as a causative for neuro degenerative diseases (https://www.  genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene  $:=$  MAP1A & keywords  $\fallingdotseq$  MAP1A,  Liu et al., 2015 ). SNP rs4644832 is also correlated to expression of  PDIA3 , the gene encoding a protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that  interacts with lectin chaperones cal ret i cul in and calnexin to modulate  folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins ( Tatusova et al., 2016 ).  PDIA3  с atalyzes the formation, isomer iz ation, and reduction or oxida­ tion of disulfide bonds ( Bourdi et al., 1995; Gaucci et al., 2016 ), playing  an important role in post-translational modification and folding of client  proteins. Another gene,  HYPK , is involved in negative regulation of  apoptosis regulation and protein stabilization ( Ray chau dhu ri et al.,  2008 ). Moreover,  HYPK  has the chaperone-like activity and is related to  regulation of heat shock response ( Das and Bhatt a chary ya, 2016 ) and  protein homeostasis ( Ghosh and Ranjan, 2022 ). Altogether, these find­ ings open up future perspectives to study possible links between  SERF2  and outcomes of IS because pro teo stasis takes an especially important  place during response to ischemia-reperfusion.  

# Conclusion  

The present study reveals the novel genetic association between  rs4644832  SERF2  and the risk of IS in females and non-smokers. These  data provide the new insights of involvement of recently discovered  class of chaperones Hero in both neurological and cardiovascular pa­ thology. Further studies may help to uncover the details of its particular  role in the pathogen es is of stroke.
