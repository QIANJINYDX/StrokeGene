Purpose:  Let-7 family members serve as crucial regulatory molecules in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. We predicted that genetic variations in the let-7 family ’ s promoters may be linked to the risk of ischemic stroke. The connection of rs10877887 and rs13293512 in the let-7 family promoters with liability to ischemic stroke was explored in this study.  Patients and methods:  Clinical data and peripheral blood samples were collected from 914 ischemic stroke patients and 836 controls in this case  control study. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS. Results:  Our analysis results reveal that the rs10877887   $\mathrm{T}C\!+\!C C$   genotype in the dominant model is associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke than the TT genotype. Individuals with heterozygous TC or homozygous CC genotypes in the male population showed higher odds of ischemic stroke than those with the wild TT genotype in rs13293512 analysis. Furthermore, there existed a multiplicative interaction between the rs10877887 C allele and the rs13293512 T allele. In the presence of the rs13293512 T allele, the effect of the rs10877887 C allele on ischemic stroke risk was increased. Similarly, in the presence of the rs10877887 C allele, the outcome of the rs13293512 T allele on ischemic stroke risk was elevated. In addition, the rs13293512 CC genotype seemed to lead to an earlier onset of ischemic stroke. Conclusion:  Our  ﬁ ndings indicated that these two SNPs might have a joint role in IS and could potentially act as risk markers. Detecting let-7 promoter polymorphisms could raise awareness of the risk of IS, which directed individuals with risk alleles to have regular checks at an appropriate frequency to avoid developing the disease.

# Introduction  

Stroke is China ’ s main cause of mortality and years of life lost. With the aging population and increasing urbanization, stroke incidence has risen in China.   Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multi factorial and multigenic disease that develops when blood supply to a speci ﬁ c part of the brain is disrupted or diminished, generally due to a thrombus. Although there are advancements in re can aliz ation therapy, treatment options for stroke are still limited.   Identifying genetic variants related to the onset risk of IS could contribute to understanding its pathogen es is and further developing innovative strategies for managing and preventing this complicated disease. Although several gene polymorphisms have been linked to the occurrence of stroke,  6   the genetic variations linked to the predisposition to IS in Chinese people have yet to be identi ﬁ ed.  

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), single-stranded noncoding RNAs, are approximately 22 nucleotides long and have important roles in widespread biological processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and development.  9   In terms of sequence and function, let-7 and its relatives are highly conserved across animals. Let7 dys regulation results in a cellular state that is less differentiated, as well as the development of cell-based diseases such as cancer.   Furthermore, genetic variants in let-7 promoters may affect transcriptional activity and further affect the expression level of let-7,  13   thus affecting individual susceptibility to several kinds of cancer. , ,  17 However, the roles of let-7 promoter genetic polymorphisms in IS occurrence and prognosis remain unclear.  

In addition, SNP-SNP interactions may also play a function in illness etiology and contribute to the interpretation of genomic data.  20   As a result, epistasis in genetics and epidemiological impact modi ﬁ cation have shown SNPSNP interactions and their departure from independent effects, which would help researchers better understand IS ’ s hereditary component.  

In this hospital-based case  control study with 914 IS patients and 836 controls, the impact of two SNPs (rs10877887 and rs13293512) in the let-7 promoter was investigated. In a northern Chinese Han population, we wanted to investigate whether there was a link between let-7 promoter genetic variations at the loci and IS risk, as well as the associations between the two loci in a multiplicative model.  

# Material and methods  

Subjects  

Our study comprised 914 patients and 836 healthy controls who were age- and gender-matched. From December 2013 to December 2015, patient data were gathered at China Medical University First Hospital. Included patients and controls followed the same standards as those in our published publication. , ,   Patients had to meet the following criteria: (1) a sudden onset of focal neurological de ﬁ cits such as hemiplegia and aphasia; (2) disorders that exceeded one day; and (3) brain radiological proof of the associated infarction. Patients with   $\mathrm{TIA,}$  car dio embolism, brain trauma, cerebro vascular malfor- mations, or serious diseases of other systems such as coagulation disorders, autoimmune diseases, tumors, or chronic infectious diseases will be excluded from the study. Controls were included if they did not have indications of stroke or other neurological illnesses, as well as no other systemic conditions. This study was authorized by the Institutional Ethical Committee of China Medical University First Hospital on February 20, 2012 (No. 2012- 38-1), and research was performed according to the World Medical Association ’ s Code of Ethics (Declaration of Helsinki). All of the participants signed a written informed consent form. On December 27, 2017, the protocol was recorded in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR-COC-17013559).  

# SNP selection  

The UCSC genome browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/ ) and the dbSNP database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ s  $\mathrm{up/?term}=\mathrm{dBNSP}$  ) were utilized to look for SNPs. SNPs were chosen according to the following criteria: (a) minor allele frequency  ${\tt>}0.05$   in a Chinese Han population; (b) situated   $-10\;\mathrm{~kb~}$   upstream of microRNA-let-7. rs10877887, which is positioned -286 base pairs (bp) upstream of let-7i, and rs13293512, which is located -8496 bp upstream of the let-7a-1/let-7f-1/let-7d cluster, were discovered. The public dbSNP database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/ ) was utilized to access SNP ID numbers and full sequence data for rs10877887 and rs13293512. In the Chinese Han population, the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the two SNPs indicated above was larger than 0.05.  

# DNA extraction and genotyping  

Genomic DNA was isolated, and the SNaPshot reaction was carried out as reported previously. ,   For genotypic analysis, the SNaPshot Multiplex Kit (Applied Biosystems Co., Ltd., Foster City, CA, USA) was utilized. The forward and reverse sequences of the rs10877887 PCR primers were TT G GT GTC TG ACT G CGC TTT TG and AAGAGAGAA A A GC GG CG GT GTC, respectively. The forward and reverse sequences of the rs13293512 PCR primers were AAAA GG CA GG GAA GAC AGT GA AT G and A AT GC AAA GG A AT GCC A CAT GA, respectively. Samples were implemented in the ABI 3130XL DNA Genetic Analyzer and analyzed using GeneMapper 4.0 (Applied Biosystems Co., Ltd.).

(SPSS)  $\mathrm{v}23.0$  . All of the tests were two-tailed, with a significance threshold of 0.05. We used Pearson ’ s    $\chi^{2}$    test to assess the demographic data distribution and looked for differences between patients and controls in risk factors and genotypes for alleles and haplotypes. Hardy  Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each genotype and odds ratios (ORs) were tested and assessed by goodness-ofﬁ t  $\chi^{2}.$  -test. Similarly, to investigate the association between IS and a particular genotype represented by ORs and 95 percent con ﬁ dence intervals (CIs), an unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for sex, age, BMI, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of smoking, history of alcohol use and hyper lipid emi a was performed. The average age of IS onset in the three genotypes was compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the difference between the two genotypes was compared using the Student-Newman  Keuls (SNK) q test in a post hoc test. Our cohort ’ s power was derived using the Quanto power calculator. With a sample size of 914 patient samples and 836 healthy controls, we would be unable to reject the null hypothesis where   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1$   with a power of   $99.99\%$  , assuming a genotypic relative risk of 1.2, an MAF of 0.35, a  $1.47\%$   population prevalence of  ${\mathrm{IS}},$  and a Type I error probability of 0.05. Based on the measured frequencies of the two SNPs, the SHEsis analytic tool was utilized to determine linkage d is equilibrium indices   $\mathrm{{D^{\prime}}}$   and r2) and predict haplotype frequencies. To investigate additive SNP-SNP interactions, the attributable proportion (AP) owing to interaction and relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) was utilized. To evaluate multiplicative SNP-SNP interactions, the multiplication term in logistic regression was utilized.

Clinical characteristics and peripheral blood samples from 914 patients with IS and 836 controls were gathered and analyzed to investigate possible correlations of the rs10877887 and rs13293512 SNPs with the risk of IS. Table 1  summarizes the overall features of the participants in the two groups. Between healthy controls and patients, there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in age   $(\mathrm{P}=0.150)$   or sex   $(\mathrm{P}=0.356)$  ). Traditional IS risk factors, including body

# Allele and genotype analysis  

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in all allele distributions (rs10877887:  $\mathrm{~\ensuremath~{~\mathrm{~P~}~}~}=\mathrm{~\ensuremath~{~0.251~}~}$  rs13293512:  $\mathrm{P}=0.859)$  ). Tables 2 and 3 show the overall and speci ﬁ ed allele frequencies and genotypes of the two SNPs among the 914 patients with IS and 836 control individuals, stratiﬁ ed by sex.  

The rs10877887 C allele was signi ﬁ cantly linked with a lower risk of IS than the rs10877887 T allele (adjusted  $\mathrm{{OR}}{=0.856}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.741  0.988,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.033$  ), as shown in Table 2A . Individuals with the heterozygous TC genotype for rs10877887 had a signi ﬁ cantly lower risk of IS than those with the homozygous wild-type TT genotype (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.800$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.653  0.980,   $\mathrm{P}=0.031$  ). In the dominant model, the   $\mathrm{TC}+\mathrm{CC}$   genotype was associated with a signi ﬁ cantly lower risk of IS than the TT genotype of rs10877887 (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}\ \ =\ \ 0.817$  ,   $95\%$   CI:  $0.673{-}0.992$  ,  $\mathrm{P}=0.041$  ). In the recessive model, however, no signi ﬁ cant changes between the two groups were identi ﬁ ed. Individuals with the heterozygous TC genotype had a lower risk of IS than those with the homozygous wild-type TT genotype (adjusted  $\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathrm{OR}}&{{}=}&{0.676,}\end{array}$   $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.517{-}0.883{\mathrm{,~P}}{=}0.004)$   in the male population, as shown in  Table 2B . In the dominant model, the   $\mathrm{TC}+\mathrm{CC}$  genotype was correlated with a signi ﬁ cantly lower risk of IS (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}=0.757}$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.588  0.976,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.032$  ) than the TT genotype of rs10877887. The rs10877887 C allele was shown to be signi ﬁ cantly correlated with a lower risk of IS in females than the rs10877887 T allele (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}}{=0.800}$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.642  0.996,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.045$  ). The TC genotype was related to a lower risk than the TT genotype (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}=0.546$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.308  0.970,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.039$  ) in the genotype analysis, whereas in the recessive model, the CC genotype was linked with a lower risk than the TT

  $+\mathrm{TC}$   genotype (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}=0.541$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.311  0.939,

  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.029.$  ), as shown in  Table 2B .  

In the rs13293512-related investigation, there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between overall IS patients and corresponding healthy controls ( Table 3A ). The TC and CC rs13293512 genotypes were shown to be more prevalent in the male population

 ( Table 3B ) (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,1.605,}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.208  2.133,

  $\mathrm{P}=0.001$   and adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}=1.446$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.005  2.081,

  $\mathrm{~P~}=\ 0.047$  , respectively). In the dominant model, the

  $\mathrm{TC}\;+\;\mathrm{CC}$   genotype was associated with a signi ﬁ cantly higher risk of IS than the TT genotype (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}=1.559$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.192  2.039,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.001$  ). Furthermore, compared to the rs13293512 T allele, the rs13293512 C allele was signi ﬁ cantly linked with an elevated risk of IS (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.233$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.033  1.472,   $\mathrm{P{=}}0.020$  ).

TC rs13293512 genotypes were represented with a lower frequency than the TT genotype (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,0.685,}$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.486  0.965,  $\mathrm{P}=0.031$  ) ( Table 3B ).  

Besides, there were interactions between SNP and sex. When taking female subjects with rs10877887 TT  $+\mathrm{TC}$   genotype as reference, the impact of C allele was changed by male gender. In parallel, when taking female subjects with rs13293512 TT genotype as reference, the impact of C allele was changed by male gender.  

# SNP-SNP interaction analysis  

The impact of the C risk allele at rs10877887 was changed by the T risk allele at rs13293512. In the multiplicative model, the genetic interactions resulted in signi ﬁ - cant statistical epistasis   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.566)$  ,  $95\%$   CI:0.352  0.912,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.019$  ).  

In addition, we found that there was no signi ﬁ cant difference in the overall haplotype distribution between patients and controls (global test  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.124)$  ) which indicates that the two SNPs were not in linkage d is equilibrium in our study population   $\mathrm{(D^{\prime}{=}0.033)}$  ,   $\mathbf{r}^{2}{=}0.001)$  ). Thus, we investigated whether an interaction existed between the rs10877887 and rs13293512 polymorphisms in IS risks, as shown in Table 4. Crossover analysis revealed that individuals with the rs10877887 TC and rs13293512 TC genotypes had a signi ﬁ cantly lower risk of IS   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.711$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.520–0.972$  ,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.032$  ) than those with the wild TT genotype. The risk of IS related to rs 10877887 TC/CC and rs13293512TC/TT (adjusted  $\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathrm{OR}}&{{}=}&{0.727,}\end{array}$   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.587{-}0.901$  ,  $\mathrm{P}=0.004$  ,  Table 4A ) was found to be higher than that associated with rs 10877887 TT and rs13293512CC (adjusted OR  $\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathrm{~\boldmath~\omega~}}&{{}=}&{0.791}\end{array}$   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.559{-}1.119$  ,  Table 4A ) or with rs10877887TC/CC and rs13293512CC (adjusted  $\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathrm{OR}}&{{}=}&{1.066,}\end{array}$   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.756{-}1.501$  ,  Table 4A ).  

Table 4B  shows that the  ﬁ ndings of the rs13293512 T allele were modi ﬁ ed by the rs10877887 C allele as well as with the results of each locus strati ﬁ ed by the other risk allele for IS. When rs10877887 possessed the T risk allele, the impact of the T risk allele at rs13293512 was higher

 (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.706,$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.504  0.988,  $\mathrm{P}=0.043$   vs.

  $\mathrm{~P~}=\ 0.112)$  , indicating signi ﬁ cant statistical epistasis

 ( Table 4B ). We also detected a similar trend for the effect of the rs18877887 C allele interacting with the rs13293512

  $\mathrm{T}$   allele (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}~=~0.734~\ 95\%$   CI: 0.591  0.910,

  $\mathrm{P}\,=\,0.005,$  ,  Table 4B , in the absence of rs13293512 T vs.

  $\mathrm{P}=0.266$  ).  

However, the statistical analyses suggest that the interaction on an additive scale is not signi ﬁ cant (RERI  $=~-$  0.333,  $95\%$   CI: -0.869-0,203;   $\mathrm{AP}\,=\,-0.29,$  ,   $95\%$   CI: -0.726-

 0.146;  $S=0.308$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.166-0.571) between rs10877887 and rs13293512.  

# rs10877887 and rs13293512 polymorphisms and age at onset of stroke  

In patients with IS, the average age of IS onset was higher in those with the rs13293512 TT/TC genotype than in those with the corresponding CC genotype   $({\mathrm{P=}}0.031.$  ; Fig. 1 A). Thus, the CC genotype of rs13293512 seems to have been an effect in accelerating the onset age of IS. There was no association between rs10877887 and age at onset of stroke   $(\mathrm{P}{>}\ 0.05)$  ;  Fig. 1 B).  

# Discussion  

This article investigated the relationship between two genetic polymorphisms of the let-7 promoter and IS risk. The  ﬁ ndings suggested that rs10877887 and rs13293512

exert a considerable role in IS development and that they had SNP-SNP interactions in the multiplicative model. Furthermore, the rs13293512 CC genotype seemed to have an effect in accelerating the average age of IS onset.  

Let-7 family promoter polymorphisms were found to be involved in the pathogen es is process of human diseases.  17 ,  25 rs10877887 is biologically functional because such a variation in ﬂ uences let-7i expression and in turn modulates the expression of several oncogenes and affects important modulators of the cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis.   In addition, patients with the rs 10877887 CC genotype had a decreased level of let-7i in carcinoma tissues.   For rs13293512, researchers found that rs13293512 could increase the likelihood of radiation enteritis via the regulation of let-7 expression, which further in ﬂ uenced IL-6 expression in colonic mucosa samples and peripheral blood.   Sun et al. suggested that Chinese women carrying the rs13293512 CC genotype had an increased risk of breast cancer, in which the rs13293512 CC genotype had a decreased expression of let-7, resulting in a higher risk of developing breast cancer.   Furthermore, Sima et al. reported that rs13293512 CC/CT is a risk factor for intra cerebral aneurysm development, possibly due to genotypes leading to a lower level of let-7a, while Zhu et al. found that the variant C allele led to a lower let-7a expression level than the wild   $\mathrm{T}$   allele in HEK293T cells.   Taking these studies into account, it is reasonable to speculate that rs10877887 and rs13293512 participate in the pathogen es is of disease through the regulation of the expression level of let-7 families.  

The let-7 family is among the most plentiful miRNA families in the cerebrum.   In humans, it involves tumor suppression,   anti-ang io genesis 28   and neuro-in ﬂ ammation.   Gong et al. reported that let-7f may control in ﬂ ammation in massive cerebral infarction patients without hemorrhagic transformation. Anti-let-7f antagomir could modulate insulin-like growth factor signaling and then promote neuro protection in an IS rat model.   Additionally, the expression level of let-7 was shown to be dysregulated in an IS mouse model, ,   which indicated that let-7 might be a protective factor. In addition, let $\cdot7\mathrm{g}^{*}$  could target IL-8 mRNA and then attenuate IL-8 expression levels. Additionally, let $.7\mathrm{g}^{\ast}$   could narrow the strokeinduced increase in chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3 and CCL5, which indicated anti-in ﬂ ammatory impacts. Furthermore,  $_{\mathrm{let-7g^{*}}}$   strongly improved neurovascular perfusion following IS.   Over expression of let-7i reduced transforming growth factor $\upbeta$   receptor type 1

 (TGF $\upbeta$   R1) expression, endo the li al-mes enc hy mal transition

 (endoMT) and vascular  ﬁ brosis, decreased the infarction area and leakage of the blood  brain barrier (BBB) and improved neurological functions.   Overall, the let-7 family plays an important role in IS pathogen es is. In another IS study, Zhang et al. suggested that the rs13293512 CC genotype had a reduced risk of IS with no sex difference, with no signi ﬁ cant difference observed in the rs10877887 genotype

frequencies, while rs 10877887 TC/CC and rs 13293512 TC/ CC genotypes had a reduced risk of IS risk in combined analysis,   which is different from our results. These disparities might be linked to genetic variability caused by variations in geography and ethnicity. Sample size, research design, and patient selection criteria might all be factors that contribute to different outcomes.  

Let-7 family members could be regulated by estradiol (E2) and control the E2 response in a negative regulatory loop, as well as causing changes in the E2-induced transcriptome and proteome in breast cancer cells.   Chen Y et al. further strengthened the possibility that let-7-involved regulation of steroid o geni c acute regulatory protein (STAR) may exert an important function in the

Therefore, we speculated that the existence of endogenous sex hormones such as estrogen, which differs between men and women, might explain, at least in part, the phenomena where an opposing trend for rs13293512 was detected in the male and female populations. Besides, let-7 play roles in disease by affecting hormone receptors. , Mutations in rs10877887 and rs13293512 regulated the expression of miR-let -7 and further led to IS which may exist sex difference. The precise underlying mechanisms need further research and explanation.  

Interestingly, through gene-gene interactions, we found a combination effect of two SNPs that contribute to a decreased risk for IS, especially in individuals with heterozygous TC genotypes for both rs10877887 and rs13293512. Moreover, the rs13293512 CC genotype appeared to lead to an earlier average age of IS onset. More attention should be given to controlling other risk factors in individuals with this genotype. In other words, detecting let-7 promoter polymorphisms may raise awareness of IS risk, and earlier-onset groups may be recommended to have frequent checks to avoid IS and mitigate its negative consequences.  

However, our  ﬁ ndings should be reviewed with caution because of some limitations. First, individuals in our study were restricted to a northern Chinese Han community, and we lacked large-scale research. More study is needed to determine whether the  ﬁ ndings can be applied to other populations. Second, there were no in vivo or in vitro investigations to determine whether the genetic variations described in this study increased IS risk through regulation of the expression or function of host genes. Third, because IS is such a complicated disease, the impact of many genetic and environmental variables was not adjusted in this study. As a result, some of these outcomes may be coincidental.  

# Conclusion  

In conclusion, our study indicates that in a northern Chinese Han population, let-7 promoter polymorphisms were signi ﬁ cantly correlated with IS risk. We further found that the two SNPs might play a combined role in IS. Moreover, our work pointed out that the CC genotype leads to earlier onset of IS, which suggests that various genomic loci require validation in other cohorts. However, to better comprehend their signi ﬁ cance in the pathophysiology of IS, the functional mechanisms by which these two SNPs act should be clari ﬁ ed. Because the disability and lethality caused by IS increase the socioeconomic burden, strategies for the early detection of earlier onset populations and prevention are useful to solve this global problem. Detecting let-7 promoter polymorphisms may raise awareness of the risk of IS, and those in earlier stages of the disease may be recommended to have frequent checks and control the other modi ﬁ able risk factors to avoid developing the disease.
