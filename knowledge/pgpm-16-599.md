Background:  The path o physiological mechanism of ischemic stroke is complex. Traditional risk factors cannot fully or only partially  explain the occurrence and development of IS. Genetic factors are getting more and more attention. Our study aimed to explore the  association between  CYP4F2  gene polymorphism and susceptibility to IS.  

Methods:  A total of 1322 volunteers were enrolled to perform an association analysis through SNPStats online software. Using FPRP  (false-positive report probability) to detect whether the result is a noteworthy finding. The interaction of SNP-SNP in IS risk was  assessed by multi-factor dimensionality reduction. Statistical analysis of this study was mainly completed by SPSS 22.0 software.  

Results:  Mutant allele “A”   $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.24)$  ) and genotype “AA” (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.49)$  ) or “GA”   $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.26)$  ) of  CYP4F2- rs2108622 are risk genetic  factors for IS. Rs2108622 is significantly associated with an increased risk of IS among subjects who are females, aging  ${\tt>}60$   years old,  with BM  $\mathrm{I}\,{\ge}24\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  , and smoking or drinking volunteers.  CYP4F2 -rs3093106 and -rs3093105 are associated with susceptibility to IS  among smoking, drinking subjects, or IS patients complicated with hypertension.  

Conclusion:  CYP4F2 -rs2108622, -rs3093106, and -rs3093105 are associated with an increased risk of IS.  

Keywords:  ischemic stroke, susceptibility,  CYP4F2 , genetic variants, association analysis  

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS) is a serious disease that endangers human health. The high cost of treatment and poor prognosis of IS  bring serious pain and burden to patients and society. IS is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially in lower-income countries. IS is a complex disease in path o physiology. At present, traditional risk factors have been found to be  hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyper lipid emi a, smoking, atrial fibrillation, hyper lipid emi a, obesity, and so on. In addition,  timely diagnosis of blood system diseases is also very important for the timely and appropriate treatment of stroke patients. The study found that although the prevalence of IS improved with the implementation of preventive measures targeting these  traditional risk factors, the risk of recurrence remained. , The above may be related to a lack of awareness and control of new  potential risk factors. Although less appreciated, genetic causes contribute significantly to the development of ischemic  stroke, especially in early-onset stroke. Therefore, it IS of great significance to explore the genetic factors related to IS.  

At present, with the development of technology, genes related to ischemic stroke have been reported a lot, but the  results cannot be repeated or have not been studied to repeat. Excavation of genetic susceptibility genes for IS in specific  populations will help to find more accurate IS predictors and new biomarkers, which in turn provide earlier diagnosis and  prognosis for IS patients. CYP4 is one of the cytochrome P450 subfamily, mainly responsible for fatty acids and related  metabolism.  CYP4F2  is a member of the CYP4 subfamily and is the main synthase metabolized by arachidonic acid to  

20-hydroxy ei cosa tetra en oic acid (20-HETE). For patients with cerebral hemorrhage, 20-HETE can lead to a sharp  decrease in blood flow, which has been confirmed in related animal experiments. The production of a large amount of  20-HETE can lead to oxidative stress and endo the li al cell damage, thereby increasing the incidence of ischemic stroke. The above suggests that   $C Y P4F2$    is expected to become a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.  

Several studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  CYP4F2 -rs2108622 can inhibit the conver­ sion of arachidonic acid to 20-HETE. , Although there are more and more studies on these SNPs and ischemic stroke  , susceptibility, the results are not consistent, which may be related to the small sample size and the limitations of the  genetic background of the subjects. No study has been reported on the association between  CYP4F2  genetic polymorph­ ism and IS risk in population from southern China.  

One of the purposes of this study is to conduct replicate test in different populations based on previous studies, which  will further clarify the association between  CYP4F2 -rs2108622 and IS in population from southern China. We will also  explore new genetic polymorphisms associated with IS susceptibility. Our study will provide a reference for the genetic  etiology of ischemic stroke, and then provide effective help for the diagnosis and treatment of IS in specific populations.  

# Methods  

# Sample Source  

A total of 1322 volunteers were enrolled in this case-control study, consisting of 661 IS patients and 661 healthy  individuals. All volunteers were recruited in Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine Affiliated Haikou  Hospital during the same period. The case group consisted of patients with newly diagnosed ischemic stroke and was  confirmed by rigorous computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) brain imaging. Patients with IS  confirmed to have cerebral hemorrhage or other accompanying serious medical diseases, such as malignant tumors,  severe liver and kidney dysfunction, malignant anemia and autoimmune diseases, were excluded. The control group was  healthy individuals with no history of stroke.  

After fully informing all subjects of the purpose and significance of this study and obtaining their informed consent,  5mL of peripheral venous blood was collected.  

# Selection of SNPs and Genotyping  

18  CYP4F2 -rs2108622 obtained from previous studies was selected as a candidate SNP to explore whether it is associated  with susceptibility to IS among the Han population from southern China.  

We searched the chromosome location of the  CYP4F2  gene in the Ensembl genome browser of the GRCH38.p13 version  to avoid missing genetic variants ( https://asia.ensembl.org/Homo sapiens/Gene/Summary?db  $\vDash$  core;g=ENSG00000186115;  r=19:15878023-15898077 ). Then, inputting the information related to “CYP4F2”, chromosome position and the population  (CHS or CHB) in the “VCF to PED” module, files with the filename suffix “.info” and “.ped” will be downloaded. After  importing the downloaded two files into Haploview software, set specific parameters in the “Tagger” module to obtain  tagSNPs. Specific parameters included  $\mathrm{r}^{2}\!>\!0.8$  , Min Genotype  $>75\%$  ,  $\mathrm{MAF}\,{>}\,0.05$   and   $\mathrm{HKE}\,{>}\,0.01$  . Finally, candidate SNPs  for this study were randomly selected from tagSNPs (rs3093106, rs3093105). Designing primers was performed through  MassARRAY Assay Design software ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Genotyping was completed by MassARRAY  ®  -IPLEX SNP  genotyping technology. Genotyping success rate reached   $100\%$  .  

# Data Analysis  

Measurement data was expressed as mean  $\pm$   standard deviation, count data was expressed as frequency (percentage). The   $\chi^{2}$   goodness-of-fit was used to test whether the candidate genetic polymorphisms were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium (HWE   $P$    value   ${>}0.05$   was considered to be consistent with HWE). SNPStats online tool was used for  association analysis between susceptibility to IS and candidate SNPs ( https://www.snpstats.net/start.htm?q=snpstats/start.  htm ). Using odds ratios (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CI) values to evaluate the association between candidate  SNPs and susceptibility to IS. Results were adjusted by age, gender, BMI, smoking or drinking status, helping to avoid  influence of confounding factors. Using online database to visualize the significant results of the stratified analysis  (SangerBox:  http://sangerbox.com/home.html #), and the forest map will be drawn. In addition, since multiple hypoth­ esis tests may increase the false-positive probability, we used FPRP (false-positive report probability) to detect whether  positive result is noteworthy finding (FPRP threshold is 0.2 and prior probability level is 0.25). Multi-factor  dimensionality reduction (MDR) was chosen to evaluate interaction of SNP-SNP. “p   $<\,0.05"$   indicates statistical  significance.  

# Results  

# Basic Information of Subject and Candidate SNPs  

As shown in  Table 1 , there were no significant difference in age, gender, BMI, and drinking/smoking status between case  and control group, indicating that the two groups were comparable.  

We found that of  CYP4F2  is on the Chromosome 19: 15,878,023–15,898,077 from Ensembl Genome browser for  GRCH38 version, including 5931 genetic variants. According to the flow chart shown in  Figure 1 ,  CYP4F2 -rs3093105  (chromosome 19: 15,897,578) and  CYP4F2 -rs3093106 (chromosome 19: 15,897,447) were randomly selected as  candidate SNPs for this study. The genotypic frequencies of the three candidate SNPs in the control group were  consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Minor allele frequencies (MAF) of candidate SNPs in the African,  European, and Han Chinese in Beijing/Shanghai population (1000 genomes) obtained through e!Ensembl genome  browser can be seen in  Table 2 . The results showed that the MAF of candidate SNPs is different in populations with  different genetic backgrounds ( Table 2 ).  

# Association Between  CYP4F2  SNPs and Susceptibility to IS  

We found only  CYP4F2 -rs2108622 has an association with susceptibility to IS among whole subjects ( Table 3 ). Compared with  wild-type allele “G” and wild homozygous genotype “GG”, mutant allele “A” (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.24)$   and genotype “AA”   $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.49)$  ) or  “GA”   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.26)$  ) of rs2108622 are risk genetic factors for IS. Rs2108622 also has a significant association with increased risk  of IS under dominant   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.30)$  ) and log-additive genetic models   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.24)$  ). As shown in  Figure 2 ,  CYP4F2 -rs2108622 is

significantly associated with an increased risk of IS among subjects who are females, aging  ${\tt>}60$   years old,   $\mathrm{BMI}\,{\geq}\,24\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  , and  smoking or drinking volunteers. Interestingly, the mutant allele (A) is a genetic risk factor for IS in all of the above volunteers.  

Stratified analysis showed ( Figure 2 ) that  CYP4F2 -rs3093106 had a significant association with susceptibility to IS among  smoking (CT VS TT:  $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.52$  ), drinking volunteers (CT VS TT:  $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.50$  ) or IS patients complicated with hypertension (CT  VS TT:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.70$  ). Similarly, mutant genotype “CA” of  CYP4F2 -rs3093105 is associated with susceptibility to IS among  smoking   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.60)$  ), drinking volunteers   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.55)$  ), or IS patients complicated with hypertension   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.69)$  ).  

We have also divided IS patients according to whether they were complicated CHD or diabetes for stratified analysis,  but there was no positive finding ( Supplemental Table 2 ).  

# Analysis of False-Positive Report Probability  

Statistical power for positive results of the overall analysis ranges from   $92.61\%$   to   $100.0\%$  , indicating that the sample  size of this study is large enough to effectively prevent the occurrence of false-positive results. Results showed that the  prior probability of all positive results found in our study is less than 0.2 ( Supplemental Table 3 ), indicating that the  significant association between candidate SNPs and susceptibility to IS found in our study are noteworthy findings.

# SNP-SNP Interaction and IS Risk  

MDR analysis showed that the single-locus model composed by  CYP4F2 -rs2108622 has the highest test-balanced  accuracy. F ruch terman-Reingold showed that the Information Gain (IG) value of rs2108622 is the highest  ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). The above means that the single-locus model composed by  CYP4F2 -rs2108622 can be chosen  as the best model for predicting susceptibility to IS, with perfect CVC (10/10) and the highest test accuracy of 0.533  ( Table 4 ).  

# Discussion  

CYP4F2  is the main metabolic enzyme of 20-HETE. There are relatively many studies on associations between  CYP4F2 -  , , rs2108622 and susceptibility to various cardiovascular diseases including ischemic stroke. Considering that the  minimum allele frequency of rs2108622 is significantly different in populations with different genetic backgrounds, it is  

![](images/708be0ddb0ed4a2c3fd8bec269a03a0eb419f16a73d30bff2ba693a8b3b4a47e.jpg)  

necessary to study the relationship between rs2108622 and IS risk in different populations. There are no related studies  have been reported among the Han population from southern China. This is the first study to investigate the association  of  CYP4F2 -rs2108622, -rs3093106, and-rs3093105 with ischemic stroke risk in the population from southern China, and  some noteworthy results have been found.  

Among subjects, allele “A” of CYP4F2-rs2108622 is risk genetic factor for IS. We have observed that this SNP  was associated with IS risk in previous studies. , It is worth noting that rs2108622 was only significantly  associated with IS in men in a previous association study conducted in a northern Chinese Han population, and no  positive results were found in all subjects and female participants. However, we found CYP4F2-rs2108622 was

significantly associated with IS risk in whole or female subjects, and no positive results were found in males. We  speculate that the reason for this may be that, although both Chinese Han populations, but the genetic background  of the northern and southern populations are different. This further illustrates the need to identify IS susceptibility  genes in a specific population, which will contribute to the accurate prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of IS.  

In addition, we have investigated the association between  CYP4F2 -rs3093106, -rs3093105, and IS risk to identify new  susceptibility genetic loci of IS. We only found that -rs3093106 and -rs3093105 were associated with an increasing risk of  IS in stratified analyses. Nevertheless, FPRP results suggested that positive results found in stratified analyses are  noteworthy new findings. The study has reported that  CYP4F2 -rs3093105 is potentially associated with the course of  coronary heart disease. CYP4F2-rs3093105 and rs3093106 have been reported to be significantly associated with reduced  lung cancer risk. No studies have been reported on the relationship between the above two genetic polymorphisms and IS  risk. We are the first to find evidence that CYP4F2-rs3093106 and-rs3093105 can be used as novel susceptibility loci for IS.  It will provide new ideas for further targeting CYP4F2 gene polymorphism to treat IS.  

The level of 20-HETE is higher in IS patients. Inhibition of 20-HETE may reduce infarct size by reducing oxidative  stress and apoptosis in neurons. However, synthetase of 20-HETE increased after 7 days of ips i lateral ischemic injury  in rats, which suggested that up-regulation of the CYP4F family of 20-HETE synthetase may be involved in ang io genesis  and neuro inflammation. Combined with our study, we speculate that  CYP4F2 -rs2108622, -rs3093106, and -rs3093105  were significantly associated with increased risk of IS, which may be the contribution of these three genetic polymorphisms  have up-regulated CYP4F2 gene expression, leading to the increased level of 20-HETE, which in turn affected the  susceptibility to ischemic stroke. However, the above is just a speculation. It will be very interesting and meaningful to  further design functional verification tests to explore specific mechanisms of three candidate genetic polymorphisms in the  occurrence and development of IS.  

There are still some limitations in this study. Firstly, large sample size is necessary to ensure the reliability and  repeatability of the results. Secondly, it would be interesting to further design functional validation experiments to clarify  the specific mechanism of three candidate CYP4F2 SNPs in the occurrence and development of IS. Thirdly, different  stroke subtypes such as large vessel disease, small vessel ischemic strokes, or lacunar strokes are also worthy of study. In subsequent studies, it will be very meaningful to further explore the association between CYP4F2 SNPs and the  susceptibility of different stroke subtypes, which will lay a reliable theoretical foundation for diagnosing and managing  different stroke subtypes in the clinic. Nevertheless, we are the first to explore the association between candidate  CYP4F2 SNPs (rs2108622, rs3093106, and rs3093105) and susceptibility to IS among the population from southern  China and noteworthy positive results have been found.  

# Conclusions  

To sum up, we confirmed that CYP4F2 SNPs (rs2108622, rs3093106, and rs3093105) have a significant association with the  occurrence of IS in the population from southern China. This may provide new ideas for the prevention and diagnosis of IS.
