Background:  Increasing evidences for the role of tumor necrosis factor $\cdot\upalpha$   (TNF $\cdot\upalpha$  ) in the occurrence of ischemic stroke (IS) have shown that it belongs to pro-in ﬂ ammatory cytokines and carries functional polymorphisms (TNF  $\cdot\upalpha$   − 238G/A and TNF $\upalpha$   − cytokine level. We determined the association between these polymorphisms and the occurrence of IS in the Chinese Han and Uyghur populations. Methods:  The TNF ${\cdot\alpha}$     $-238\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{A}$   and TNF $\cdot\upalpha$     $-308G/\mathsf{A}$   polymorphisms were determined by TaqMan SNP Genotyping assays in cases (  $\cdot n\!=\!7481$  ) and controls (  $'n\!=\!748.$  ). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to show the association between the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   genotypes and the IS events. Results:  No signi ﬁ cant difference was found in the association between TNF ${\cdot\alpha}$   − 238G/A and IS in both ethnic populations. The result showed that carriage of the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 308GA was a decreased risk of IS in both Han and Uyghur populations (OR:0.453, 0.213). In addition, the signi ﬁ cant difference in GA frequency in TNF ${\cdot\alpha}$   was found between the two ethnic controls   $'P\!=\!0.000$  ). Conclusions:  TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 308 GA heterozygous may be an independent protective factor for IS in the Chinese Han and Uyghur populations.

# 1. Introduction  

Tumor necrosis factor $\cdot\upalpha$   (TNF $\cdot\upalpha$  ) is one of the most typical pro-in ﬂ ammatory cytokines with both bene ﬁ cial and destructive properties for the central nervous system (CNS). It is synthesized in the neurons, astrocytes, and glial cells of the CNS  [7 – 9] . As an upstream modulator for many in ﬂ ammatory cytokines and pro teo ly tic enzymes, TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   also induces IL-6 and matrix metalloprotein as es, a family of pro teo ly tic enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix around blood vessels and damage endo the li al cells, and could result in de stabilization and potential weakening of the vessel wall, passive dilation, or IS  [10 – 12] . Through these effects, it may be involved in in ﬂ ammation related to the pathogen es is of IS.  

Ischemic stroke (IS) caused by a number of factors is a leading cause for the severe disability and death in many developed and developing countries; and it accounts for about  $85{-}90\%$   of all kinds of strokes  [1] . Itis well known that there are multiple genetic factors associated with IS. Recently the studies have further shown that there is no single common genetic variant that could independently cause it. There are some unknown genes that contribute to IS aside from the common risk factors [2] . The studies have shown that cerebral ischemia and in ﬂ ammation are closely interrelated: Ischemia is a robust stimulus for the potential damaging in ﬂ ammation, while infection as well as its associated in ﬂ ammation is an important risk factor for IS  [3 – 5] . In ﬂ ammation also contributes to ischemic events through the promotion of atherosclerosis  [6] . Functional polymorphisms of in ﬂ ammatory genes may therefore in ﬂ uence the incidence and outcome of IS.  

Functional polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the genes coding for TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   gene are associated with the increased plasma levels of these cytokines. TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   $-238$   AG genotype has been associated with a high cytokine expressor phenotype  [13] . It has been also suggested that the G to A substitution located at position    $-308$   in the promoter region may affect the rate of transcription of the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$  gene. Moreover, the less common A allele is associated with higher constitutive and inducible levels of transcription and results in higher levels of cytokine production  [14] .  

# 2. Materials and methods  

2.1. Subjects and clinical evaluation  

Subjects are either Han or Uyghur, who have the different religions, languages and life customs similar to American Blacks and Whites. The current study protocol was carried out with prior approval from the local Ethics Committee and patients were enrolled from among the patients in the stroke units of six large general hospitals in Shenzhen, Heilongjiang and Xinjiang from September 2003 to February 2009. All subjects provided written informed consent. The IS was diagnosed by the standards of The World Health Organization and International Classi ﬁ cation  [15] . A total of 748 subjects diagnosed by CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within   $24\,\mathrm{h}$   of symptom onset were included in 2 case – control studies; The stroke subtypes were evaluated using the modi ﬁ ed TOAST classi ﬁ cation in total (large vessel   $(6.7\%)$  , small vessel   $(36.7\%)$  , cardio-embolic   $(13.3\%)$  , and undetermined   $(43.3\%).$  )  [16,17] . besides this, a total of 748 age and gender as well as ethnic-matched normal healthy controls were randomly selected consecutively among the enrolled healthy volunteers in the local population. Subjects with history of stroke, Alzheimer's disease, brain aneurysm, dementia, dystonia or Parkinson's disease or other in ﬂ ammatory disorders were excluded from the control group. A structured questionnaire was used to get the subjects' general information, clinical history of IS and associated clinical parameters, as well as epidemiological features.  

# 2.2. Sample processing  

After obtaining informed consent from both the groups, a   $5\:\mathrm{{ml}}$  sample of blood was taken from each volunteer and stored in Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) and plain vials. Using a DNA extraction kit (Axygen, Union City, CA) Genomic, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes pellet. DNA samples were stored at  $-80\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   before the use.  

# 2.3. Sample genotyping  

The polymorphisms of TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   gene were determined by using a TaqMan SNP genotyping technique. The primers of TNF $\cdot\upalpha-308$   were forward,   $5^{\prime}$  -CCC AAAA GAA AT G GAG GC A AT $.3^{\prime}$   and reverse,   $5^{\prime}$  -CACTG ACT GA TTT GT GT GTA GG $.3^{\prime}$  . The TaqMan minor groove binding (MGB) probes for detection of G/A polymorphism (rs1800629) were FAM-A GG GG CAT GG G GAC-MGB and HEX-A GG GG CAT GAG GAC GMGB. The primers and probes were commercially supplied by Shanghai GeneCore Bio technologies. Thermal cycling was performed on Stratagene   $\mathrm{Mx}4000$   systems (La Jolla, CA), while allele frequencies were determined by Stratagene Mx4000 systems. Genotyping of TNF $\upalpha$   − 238(rs361525) was performed with TaqMan SNP allelic discrimination by means of a 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), in 96-well format. The Custom TaqMan  $\circledast$   SNP Genotyping Assay was commercially supplied by Applied Biosystems (ABI Assays-onDemand) of North America.  

To improve the genotyping quality and validate our results, a random selection of   $10\%$   of the samples were re-genotyped by laboratory personnel not otherwise involved in the study, and the results were found to be reproducible with no discrepancies noted.  

# 2.4. Statistical analysis  

Allele frequencies, genotype frequencies, and carriage rates of the alleles in all the groups were compared with Fisher exact tests using SPSS software (ver 12.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) Data on quantitative characteristics were expressed as means  $\pm\,\mathrm{SD}$  . Comparisons between

MAF: Minor allele frequency.  

groups were made by    $\chi^{2}$    test for the nominal data or  t  test for the interval data. Allele frequency was calculated by the number of occurrences of the test allele in the population divided by the total number of alleles. All  $P$   values were two-tailed, and differences were statistically signi ﬁ cant when  $P{<}0.05$  . Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium was tested by  $\chi^{2}$    method. Odds ratio (OR) at  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval (CI) was to describe the strength of association in the multivariate logistic regression model.  

# 3. Results  

Table 1  shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients and controls in Han and Uyghur populations. The percentages of subjects who were male were  $58.49\%$   and   $58.00\%$   for the Han and Uyghur respectively. There was no signi ﬁ cant difference in age  $.P\!=\!\mathsf{N S}$  , 0.498) between case and control. There were signi ﬁ cant differences in the negative events and WHR   $P\!=\!0.000$  ) between the cases and controls in the Han population. Meanwhile, there were signi ﬁ cant differences in negative events, BMI   $\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.P\!=\!0.010\aftergroup\egroup\right.$  ) and WHR  $P\!=\!0.000$  ) between the cases and controls in the Uyghur population. The results showed that the hypertension and WHR increased the risk of IS in both Han and Uyghur subjects. As shown in  Table 1 , for the Han population, the case group had a higher prevalence of conventional risk factors for vascular diseases including a history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, TG, and lower ALB than the control group did. In

addition, BMI, WHR, and history of hypertension seemed to be risk factors among the Uyghur cases and controls.  

Table 2  shows the distribution of genotypes and allelic frequencies of I TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   polymorphisms. There were no signi ﬁ cant differences in the distribution of TNF $\upalpha-238\mathrm{G}/\mathsf{A}$     $\scriptstyle\left(P>0.05\right)$   polymorphisms between the case and control for both ethnic groups. However, there were signi ﬁ cant differences in the distribution of TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 308G/A polymorphisms  $\scriptstyle\left(P<0.01\right)$   between the case and control for both ethnic groups. This suggested that TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 308GA may be a protective factor. With TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   $-308$   GG as a reference genotype, TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 308GA had an odds ratio of

 0.49   $\scriptstyle\left(P<0.01\right)$   in Han and 0.20 in Uyghur   $\scriptstyle\left(P<0.01\right)$  . The patient group showed a decreased frequency of the A allele compared with the control group in the two ethnic population. The odds ratio of the A allele was 0.51 and 0.24 respectively in Han and Uyghur populations   $\scriptstyle{P=0.001}$  ), compared with the G allele. All the genotype distributions on the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   $-238$   or    $-308$   locus were in accordance with the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium in two ethnic control groups (all    $P{>}0.05$  ) except TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   $-308$   genotypes distribution in the Han control group (  $\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.P\!=\!0.042$  ).  

Fig. 1  shows the comparisons of TNF $\cdot\upalpha$     $-308\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{A}$   genotypes frequency distribution between the case and control groups respectively in the 2 ethnic groups. There was no signi ﬁ cant difference in TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   $-308\mathrm{CA}$   heterozygous frequency between the case groups in Han and Uyghur populations (  $\stackrel{}{P}=0.964$  ). Nevertheless, there was a signi ﬁ cant difference in TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 308GA heterozygous frequency between the control groups in the 2 ethnic groups (  $\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.\mathclose\bgroup\left.\mathclose\bgroup\left.\mathclose\bgroup\left.\mathclose\bgroup\left.P\!=\!0.000\aftergroup\egroup\right.\aftergroup\egroup\right.\aftergroup\egroup\right.$  ).

− 308G/A polymorphisms and IS was further assessed by multivariate logistic regression, and variables were entered into a logistic regression model if they showed statistical signi ﬁ cance after 1 factor analysis. After adjustment for some risk factors, TNF $\upalpha-308\mathrm{CA}$   was still signi ﬁ cantly associated with an increased risk of developing IS, with an overall OR 0.453 (  $0\mathbb{R}95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 0.306 – 0.671,  $P\!=\!0.000$  ) in Han and 0.213 (  $0\mathbb{R}95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 0.074 – 0.615,  $P\!=\!0.004$  ) in Uyghur. Additionally, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, tea drinking, and WHR were also found to be independent predictors of IS among the Han ( Table 3 ). On the other hand, hypertension and WHR were found to be independent risk factors of IS among the Uyghur ( Table 4 ).  

# 4. Discussion  

Ischemic stroke, the most common form of stroke, is mostly caused by atherosclerosis and is the leading neurological cause of death and disability  [18] . The studies of twin and familial aggregation have suggested that the risk of stroke has a substantial genetic component [19 – 21] . The genes underlying this risk in the general population, however, remain undetermined  [22] . In previous studies, we found several genes associated with IS, such as PDGF-D, IGF-1R, eNOS, IL-6 and Hsp70 in the Chinese Han population  [23 – 27] . Nowadays, there is mounting evidence to show the role of in ﬂ ammatory reactions in the ampli ﬁ cation and expression of acute cerebral ischemia  [22] .  

TNF  $\cdot\upalpha$  , a multi functional cytokine which acts as pl uri potent proin ﬂ ammatory mediator during the acute phase and as neuro troph ic mediator between the sub-acute and prolonged phases of IS, have both bene ﬁ cial and destructive potentials  [10 – 12] . In addition, TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   could increase the expression of adhesion molecules on endo the li al cells in the micro vas cula ture of the CNS  [28] . It promotes neuronal cell death in cultures  [29] , increases the risk of CNS reperfusion injury  [30] , and increases the infarct volume and brain edema  [31] . Meanwhile, in IS animal models without TNF $\cdot\upalpha$  , infarct sizes were found to be larger and these animals had lower neuronal survival rates than the controls too [32,33] . These studies suggested that TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   may have a direct role in the course of IS.  

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the positions    $-308$  (rs1800629) and  $-238$   (rs361525) of the promoter region of the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$  gene have been commonly studied. The polymorphisms are   ${\tt G}\!\to\!{\tt A}$  substitutions, and changes in both loci can alter the transcription-binding site and affect the transcription rate  [34] . Indeed,  $-308$   polymorphism could affect gene expression with a rare A allele, resulting in higher TNF $\cdot\upalpha$  production  in vitro  [35,36] . Our results may con ﬁ rm this  ﬁ nding; In the case group, a signi ﬁ cant lower prevalence of the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 308GA genotype was observed in both Han and Uyghur compared with controls, which may indirectly explain the high serum level of the cytokine TNF $\cdot\upalpha$  previously reported in IS cases  [37] . Through these possible mechanisms, TNF $\cdot\alpha-308\mathrm{CA}$   genotype may play a critical role in in ﬂ ammation related to and the pathogen es is of IS. The rare TNF $\cdot\alpha-238\,\mathrm{A}$   allele has also been associated with high TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   production  [13,38] . However, there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 238GA heterozygous frequency and A allele frequency when the IS case and control groups were compared, and so did for both ethnic groups.  

Furthermore, we analyzed the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 308GA heterozygous frequency discrepancies between cases and controls among the two ethnic groups. There was no signi ﬁ cant difference between the cases of the Han and the Uyghur. However, signi ﬁ cant discrepancies between Han and Uyghur controls were found, which indicated that there may exists ethnic variations between Chinese Han and Uyghur populations in terms of genetic background.  

Ourpresent ﬁ ndings con ﬁ rmed and extended previous results on the decrease of the TNF $\upalpha-308\,.$  A allele in patients with IS in the Caucasian population . We found that the risk of IS of the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   − 308 A carriers was about one-half of that of the non-carriers which showed no difference with other studies  [39,40] . Thepresent  ﬁ ndings indicated that the association could be extended to the Chinese 2 ethnics as well. However, the association wasnot replicated in a new case – control study of childhood IS which may suggest that there may exist discrepancy between childhood IS and adult IS  [41] .  

Strengths of the current study are a relative large sample size from the Han population, rigorous methods used to assess IS event (including formal assessment of reliability of interpretations of head CT and/or MRI ﬁ ndings), and a biologically plausible  a priori  rationale for choosing the candidate genes. Our study also has some limitations. First, it was designed as a case – control study and a possible selection bias cannot be excluded for the group of patients with IS. Second, due to the small population of Uyghurs in China and the rehabilitation service usually provided by the community health centers  [42] , the large Uyghur sample size was dif ﬁ cult to  ﬁ nd in the large general hospital, thus the Uyghur sample size was relative small, and might not be a perfect representative of a whole population. In addition, although all controls affected by other diseases potentially related to ischemic disorder were excluded, our population still may have included people with nonmanifesting diseases, and therefore selection bias cannot be completely avoided too. It is also possible that our  ﬁ ndings might apply only to the Chinese population. Finally, the TNF $\cdot\alpha\,-308$   genotypes distribution was not in accordance with the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium in the Han ethnic groups   $\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.\mathclose\bgroup\left.P\!=\!0.042$  ). This might be associated with the sample size, the geographical distribution of the population, or other uncertain factors.  

Based on the above analysis, the conclusion can be drawn that the polymorphism G/A at TNF $\cdot\upalpha-238$   might not contribute signi ﬁ cantly to the susceptibility or to the progression of IS in the 2 Chinese ethnic groups in the study. However, the TNF $\cdot\upalpha$   $\iota\,-308\mathrm{G}/\mathsf{A}$   polymorphism showed a signi ﬁ cant association with IS in our two case – control studies. The GA heterozygous frequency of TNF $\cdot\upalpha-308$   was less signi ﬁ cant in IS patients, indicating that A allele carriers may be associated with a decreased risk of IS. Nevertheless, we believe that conducting additional studies in a larger number of IS patients and in more ethnic populations could help us better understand their precise signi ﬁ cant association.
