We aimed to replicate reported associations of 10 SNPs at eight distinct loci with overall ischemic  stroke (IS) and its subtypes in an independent cohort of Dutch IS patients. We included 1,375 IS patients  enrolled in a prospective multi center hospital-based cohort in the Netherlands, and 1,533 populationlevel controls of Dutch descent. We tested these SNPs for association with overall IS and its subtypes  (large artery atherosclerosis, small vessel disease and card i oem boli c stroke (CE), as classified by TOAST)  using an additive multivariable logistic regression model, adjusting for age and sex. We obtained odds  ratios (OR) with  $\pmb{95\%}$   confidence intervals   $(\pmb{95\%}\,\mathsf{C I})$   for the risk allele of each SNP analyzed and exact  p-values by permutation. We confirmed the association at 4q25 ( PITX2 ) (OR 1.43;  $\pmb{95\%}$  CI, 1.13–1.81,   $\pmb{\uprho}\!=\!\pmb{0.029})$   and 16q22 ( ZFHX3 ) (OR 1.62;  $\pmb{95\%}$   CI, 1.26–2.07,  $\pmb{\uprho}\!=\!\pmb{0.001}\!.$  ) as risk loci for CE. Locus 16q22  was also associated with overall IS (OR 1.24;  $\scriptstyle{\mathfrak{g}}_{5}\%\,\mathsf{C}\,|$  I, 1.08–1.42,  $\scriptstyle{\mathsf{p}}\,=\,0.016.$  ). Other loci previously  associated with IS and/or its subtypes were not confirmed. In conclusion, we validated two loci (4q25,  16q22) associated with CE. In addition, our study may suggest that the association of locus 16q22 may  not be limited to CE, but also includes overall IS.  

A substantial proportion of the etiology of acute ischemic stroke (IS) is thought to be attributable to (common)  genetic variation 1 . Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have estimated that the proportion of phenotypic  variance of IS explained by common variants ranges between 16 and  $40\%$  , depending on subtype 1 . Thus far,  GWAS have identified a small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with overall IS or its  subtypes large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), small vessel disease (SVD) and car dio embolism   $\mathrm{(CE)^{2-11}}$  . These loci  have been suggested to be mostly or entirely subtype specific. Discovery of common variants influencing stroke  is hindered by many challenges, including but not limited to the heterogeneity of the phenotype, high lifetime  risk of stroke, late disease onset, and limited statistical power in studies performed to date. Thus, replication of  presumed risk loci in independent cohorts is emphatically recommended before initiating fine-mapping efforts  in search of causal variants and functional studies to discern the functional consequences of these variants 12 . We  aimed to replicate the associations of eight loci with IS and/or its subtypes as previously reported in an independent set of patients with IS drawn from a Dutch cohort.  

# Methods  

Participants.  We included 1,375 patients with IS of Dutch descent who were enrolled in the Dutch Parelsnoer  initiative (PSI) Cerebro vascular Disease 13 . This study represents an ongoing collaboration of eight university  medical centers in the Netherlands in which clinical data, imaging and bio materials of patients with stroke are  prospectively and uniformly collected 13 . The present study includes patients with IS enrolled between September  2009 and November 2014. IS was defined as focal neurologic deficits of sudden onset originating from the brain  and persisting for more than 24 hours, in the absence of hemorrhage as confirmed by imaging. We further

classified IS subtypes according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST), LAA, SVD, CE,  and stroke of other and of undetermined cause 14 . We used 1,533 population-level controls of Dutch descent 15 .  Information on ancestry in patients and controls was obtained by self-report. The Medical Ethics Committee of  the University Medical Center Utrecht approved the study and all patients provided written informed consent.  The research described was conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.  

Genotyping.  DNA of the cases and controls was extracted from peripheral blood. We genotyped 10 SNPs of  eight loci (1p13.2 ( TSPAN2 ), 4q25 ( PITX2 ), 6p21.1 ( SUPT3H/CDC5L ), 7p21.1 ( HDAC9 ), 9p21.3 ( CDKN2BAS1 ),  9q34 ( ABO ), 12q24 ( ALDH2 ) and 16q22 ( ZFHX3 )) using KASP assays (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, UK).  

Statistical analysis.  We removed individuals with  ${>}25\%$   missing genotypes (29 individuals; 7 cases and 22  controls). We tested each SNP for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium   $({\tt p}\!<\!0.001)$   and calculated minor  allele frequencies for each SNP in cases and controls. As the design of the study prevented us from performing  principal component analyses to test for ancestral homogeneity, we compared risk allele frequencies with those  from the Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL) Project 16 . GoNL comprises a comprehensive characterization of  genetic variation of 769 individuals of Dutch ancestry as assessed by whole-genome sequencing 16 . Frequencies  were calculated in the unrelated set of individuals in GoNL   $\mathrm{(N\,}\mathrm{=}\,498$  ). Next, we tested these SNPs for association  with IS and its subtypes using an additive logistic regression model, which includes 0, 1 or 2 copies of the risk  alleles, and adjusted for age and sex. We report odds ratios (OR) with  $95\%$   confidence intervals   $(95\%\operatorname{CI})$   for  each risk allele as established in previous studies 2 , . To assess the validity of also including samples with missing  genotypes, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding each individual with at least one missing genotype.  Accompanying exact probability-values for the observed associations were obtained by performing 10,000 permutations. Analyses were performed in Plink version  $1.9\mathsf{b}3.38$  .

# Results  

After quality control, our data set consisted of 1,368 IS patients (803   $(58.7\%)$   men, median age 67.3 years (interquartile range (IQR): 56.5–77.2)) and 1,511 controls of Dutch descent (926   $(61.3\%)$   men, median age 64.4 years  (IQR: 58.0–70.3)). Baseline characteristics of the patients with IS are presented in Supplementary Table S1. All  genotyped SNPs had call rates  ${\mathrm{>}}98\%$   and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Risk allele frequency of all variants showed high concordance with those reported in the Genome of the Netherlands Project (Table  1 ) 16 .  

At the 4q25 ( PITX2)  locus, previously identified by GWAS, we confirmed the association at rs2634074 with CE  stroke   $\mathrm{{OR}}\!=\!1.43$   for the T allele;  $95\%$   CI, 1.13–1.81,  $\mathsf{p}\!=\!0.029$  ), but not at rs2200733   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.30$   for the T allele;   $95\%$   CI, 0.96–1.76;  $\mathrm{{p=}}0.60.$  ) (Table  1 ). We also replicated 16q22 ( ZFHX3 ) as a risk locus for CE   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.62$   for the  T allele;  $95\%$   CI, 1.26–2.07,  $\mathtt{p}\!=\!0.0014)$  ) and found this locus significantly associated with overall IS (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.28$   for  the T allele;  $95\%$   CI, 1.12–1.47,  $\mathsf{p\!=\!}0.002.$  ) (Table  1 ). This association remained significant in a sensitivity analysis  excluding cases with card i oem boli c stroke (  $\mathrm{{OR}}\!=\!1.18$  ;  $95\%$   CI,  $1.03\mathrm{-}1.36,\mathtt{p}\!=\!0.02)$  , and when we only included  patients with LAA stroke or SVD (  $\mathrm{{OR}}\!=\!1.22$  ;  $95\%$   CI, 1.03–1.45,  $\mathtt{p}\!=\!0.02\rangle$  ).  

We could not replicate the previously-established associations at the 1p13.2 ( TSPAN2 ), 6p21.1 ( SUPT3H/ CDC5L ), 7p21.1 ( HDAC9 ), 9p21.3 ( CDKN2B-AS1 ), 9q34 ( ABO ) and 12q24 ( ALDH2 ) loci with overall IS or its  subtypes. However, all of the effect directions were consistent with the observed directions of the initial association reports except for the C allele of rs556621 at locus  $6\mathsf{p}21.1$   ( SUPT3H/CDC5L ) (Table  1 ).  

Results did essentially not differ when individuals with missing genotypes were excluded (Supplementary  Table S2).  

# Discussion  

In a well-defined cohort of patients with IS, we confirmed the 4q25 ( PITX2 ) and 16q22 ( ZFHX3 ) loci to be significantly associated with the IS subtype CE. We also found locus 16q22 to be significantly associated with overall IS.  We were not able to replicate the previously-established associations at the 1p13.2 ( TSPAN2 ), 6p21.1 ( SUPT3H/ CDC5L ), 7p21.1 ( HDAC9 ), 9p21.3 ( CDKN2B-AS1 ), 9q34 ( ABO ) and 12q24 ( ALDH2 ) with overall IS or its subtypes although, barring locus 6p21.1 ( SUPT3H/CDC5L ), the effect direction of their associations were consistent  with expectation 2 – 11 .  

Previous studies have consistently demonstrated the association between variants at 4q25 ( PITX2 ) and 16q22  ( ZFHX3 ) with atrial fibrillation both in patients with and without   $\mathrm{IS}^{3,10}$  , and additionally with card i oem boli c  stroke 2 – 4 . In the  $4\upmu25$   locus, we only replicated rs2634074, but not rs2200733, despite moderate linkage disequilibrium   $({\bf r}^{2}\!=\!0.51)$  ) and a comparable effect size as established previously 2 – 4 , . This finding is likely explained by  the difference in the power to detect a statistically-significant signal at each SNP (  $95\%$   and  $56\%$  , respectively), a  difference that results from their  ${\sim}10\%$   frequency difference. After the initial report of the association 10 , other  studies found locus 16q22 to be specific for  $\mathbf{\bar{C}}\mathrm{E}^{2,4}$  , whereas our findings point to a possible association with both  CE and overall IS. The association with overall IS remained significant after excluding cases with card i oem boli c  stroke, possibly suggesting a partially shared genetic architecture across different stroke subtypes 17 .  

Variants near  PITX2  that encode for a transcription factor have convincingly been implicated in sinoatrial  node development and regulation of cardiac action potentials 18 . Little is known about the role of  ZFHX3  in  ischemic stroke. Besides atrial fibrillation, this gene has also been implicated in the regulation of myogenic and  neuronal differentiation, and as a tumor suppressor gene in multiple cancers. Additionally, sequence variants in  the locus have been linked to Kawasaki disease 10 . These lines of evidence may suggest that the role of this locus  in IS might not be restricted to those of cardiac origin, and therefore may explain its potential association with  overall IS.

While recent publications have suggested that implicated variants are likely subtype specific 2 , , it is noteworthy  that some genetic overlap between diagnostic IS subtypes has also been reported 17 . Given the repeated discovery  of this locus in card i oem boli c stroke in large-scale GWAS, it is likely that the observed association of locus 16q22  with overall IS in this study is driven by a subset of patients with another IS subtype that may also have as yet  undiscovered atrial fibrillation or card i oem boli c stroke. In addition, significant associations of genetic risk scores  for atrial fibrillation with overall IS were recently found to be almost entirely explained by an association with  card i oem boli c stroke 19 .  

Several factors may have prevented us from being able to replicate all associations investigated here. First, we  had limited power to discover (nominal) associations in a relatively limited cohort size; our power was particularly limited for lower-frequency variants or variants with modest effect, a characteristic true of the vast majority  of loci discovered through genome-wide association studies (stroke loci included). Thus, it is entirely possible  that non-replicated loci are truly associated with overall IS and its subtypes and would replicate in larger sample  collections. Second, failure to replicate may also be due to phenotypic heterogeneity; subtyping approaches vary  across studies, and subtyping is imperfect, as many samples are categorized as ‘undetermined,’ thus allowing  for potentially incorrectly subtyped cases (and consequently, reducing power). However, to decrease diagnostic  uncertainty we excluded patients with transient ischemic attacks. Despite these limitations, most variants showed  comparable effect sizes in the same direction as reported previously.  

In conclusion, we validated two loci (4q25, 16q22) associated with IS caused by CE. In addition, our study may  suggest that locus 16q22 may also be associated with overall IS or another subtype for which the current study  may lack power to demonstrate a significant association. Future studies should search for the causal variants  underlying these loci by fine-mapping and further discerning which genes within the loci may have functional  consequence for disease.
