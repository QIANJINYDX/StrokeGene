# Abstract  

Background— Relationships of thrombin generation (TG) with cardiovascular disease risk are  under-evaluated in population-based cohorts.  

Objectives— Evaluate the relationships of TG influenced by the contact and tissue factor  coagulation pathways ex vivo with common SNPs and incident cardiovascular disease and stroke.  

Patients/Methods— We measured peak TG (pTG) in baseline plasma samples of  Cardiovascular Health Study participants   $(n{=}5,411)$  ), both with and without inhibitory anti-FXIa  antibody (pTG/FXIa − ). We evaluated their associations with   ${\sim}50\mathrm{K}$   SNPs using the IBCv2  genotyping array, and with incident cardiovascular disease and stroke events over a median followup of 13.2-years.  

Results— The minor allele for a SNP in the coagulation factor XII gene   $(F I2)$  , rs1801020, was  associated with lower pTG in European-Americans   $(\upbeta\mathrm{=-}34.2\;\mathrm{nm}\pm3.5\;\mathrm{nm}$  ;  $p{=}3.3{\times}10^{-22}$  ; minor  allele frequency (MAF)  $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\!0.23\mathsf{\Gamma}$  ) and African-Americans   $(\upbeta\mathrm{=}\mathrm{-}31.1\ \mathrm{nm}\pm7.9\ \mathrm{nm}$  ;  $p{=}9.0{\times}10^{-5}$  ;   $\mathrm{MAF}{=}0.42$  ). Lower FXIa-independent pTG (pTG/FXIa − ) was associated with the F12 rs1801020  minor allele, and higher pTG/FXIa −  was associated with the ABO SNP rs657152 minor allele   $(\upbeta{=}16.3\;\mathrm{nm}$  ;  $p{=}4.3{\times}10^{-9}$  ;  $\mathrm{MAF}{=}0.37$  ). The risk factor-adjusted ischemic stroke hazard ratio   $95\%$    confidence interval) was 1.09 (1.01, 1.17;  $p{\small=}0.03)$   for pTG, 1.06 (0.98, 1.15;  $p{\!=\!0.17)}$   for pTG/

  $\mathrm{FXIa^{-}}$  , and 1.11 (1.02, 1.21;  $p{\=}0.02)$  ) for FXIa-dependent pTG   $\mathrm{\Delta[pTG/FX]a^{+}}$  ), per 1-SD increment 

 (  $\scriptstyle{n=834}$   ischemic strokes). In a multi-cohort candidate gene analysis, rs1801020 was not associated  with incident ischemic stroke   $\upbeta\!\!=-0.02$  ;   $(\mathrm{SE=}0.08)$  );  $\mathsf{p{=}0.81}$  ).  

Conclusions— These results support the importance of contact activation pathway-dependent  TG as a risk factor for ischemic stroke and indicate the importance of   $F I Z$  SNPs on TG ex vivo  and in vivo.

#  Introduction  

The pro teo ly tic conversion of pro thro mb in to thrombin is the central event of hemostatic  activation [1]. Thrombin plays an essential role in clot formation by converting soluble  fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin and regulating coagulation by activating platelets, protein C,  thrombin act iv a table fi bri no lysis inhibitor, and coagulation factors V, VIII, and XI [1].  Therefore, inter-individual differences in thrombin generation (TG) may be important for  hemorrhagic or thrombotic risk.  

Increasing evidence suggests TG measurements are useful in assessing hemophilia [2, 3],  von Willebrand disease [4], thr ombo philia [5, 6], and venous thr ombo embolism (VTE) [7,  8]. Some evidence suggested higher TG was associated with increased risk of ischemic  stroke [9] and myocardial infarction (MI) [10]. The relationships of TG with cardiovascular  disease risk, however, are currently under-evaluated in population-based studies. The genetic  associations with TG are also limited.  

Currently, a majority of evidence suggests the tissue factor (TF)-VIIa-mediated coagulation  pathway is the most relevant for hemostatic activation in vivo. Accumulating evidence  implicates the coagulation factor XIIa (FXIIa)-dependent contact pathway in fibrin clot  structure and stability [11, 12], and suggests elevated coagulation factor XI (FXI) may be a  risk factor for VTE and ischemic stroke [13, 14]. The importance of the contact activation  pathway towards cardiovascular disease risk remains uncertain.  

We used a commercial assay to measure peak thrombin generation (pTG) in baseline plasma  samples of European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) older adults from the  Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). The contributions of the contact and FVIIa-TF  coagulation pathways were evaluated using an inhibitory anti-FXI antibody to measure pTG  generated independent of FXIa and to calculate a pTG phenotype that was dependent on  FXIa. We conducted SNP association scans with these pTG phenotypes, evaluated their  cross-sectional relationships with cardiovascular disease risk factors, and examined their  associations with incident cardiovascular disease and stroke during up to 22-years of followup.  

#  Methods  

#  Study Population  

The CHS is a prospective population-based cohort study of cardiovascular disease risk  factors in older American adults [15]. CHS recruited 5,201 men and women (original cohort,  1988-1989) aged 65 years and older from 4 U.S. field centers: Forsyth County, NC;  Sacramento County, CA; Washington County, MD; and Pittsburgh, PA. An additional cohort  of 687 primarily AA participants was recruited in 1992-1993, for a total cohort of 5,888  participants. Baseline evaluation included demographic information, standardized clinic  examination, lifestyle and medical histories, fasting blood collection, and assessment of  sub clinical atherosclerosis by carotid ultrasound [16].  

Additional experiments were performed using plasma samples from apparently healthy local  volunteers. All subjects gave written informed consent for participation and all procedures  were conducted under institution ally approved protocols at each center.  

#  Thrombin Generation Assay  

Citrated blood was collected at the CHS baseline exam using standardized protocols. All  technicians completed centralized training and certification [17]. Timing between  veni puncture and plasma processing (  ${\le}15$   minutes) and between plasma processing and  aliquot storage at  $-70^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   (  ${\le}10$   minutes) were standardized [17]. Plasma was processed and  aliquoted at room temperature to limit the cold-activation of FVII [18].  

Three different estimates of thrombin generation were evaluated: pTG was determined by  the peak height on the thrombin generation curve. We defined pTG/FXIa −  as pTG measured  in the presence of inhibitory FXI antibody. The anti-FXI antibody completely inhibited FXIa  [19], therefore this phenotype represented pTG minus any contribution of FXIa. pTG/FXIa +  was defined as the residual pTG after subtracting pTG/FXIa −  from pTG   $\mathrm{(pTK/FXIa^{+}}=\mathrm{pTG}$    - pTG/FXIa − ), and represented pTG that was primarily dependent on the contribution of  FXIa.  

TG was measured in three analytical batches by the Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA)  (Techno clone, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The first batch  included a random subset of 998 EA baselines samples; the second batch included 600  samples from the primarily AA cohort; and, the third batch included 3,813 remaining  baseline samples. Assay standardization across batches was achieved using control samples  provided with the TGA and with pooled normal plasma (George King Bio-Medical, Inc.;  Overland Park, KS).  

Plasma aliquots were thawed and e qui lib rated to room temperature. Techno clone Reagent C  Low was used as a source of recombinant human TF   $(71.6\,\mathsf{p M})$   and phospholipid micelles   $(3.2\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$   [7, 8]. Reagent C Low   $(10\,\mathrm{uL})$  ) and Techno clone flu orogenic substrate   $(50\,\mathrm{uL})$  ) were  added to  $40\,\mathrm{uL}$   plasma on a microtiter plate, resulting in a final tissue factor concentration of   $7.2\,\mathrm{pM}$  . Flu orogenic substrate cleavage was measured immediately using a Polarstar Optima  microplate reader (BMG Labtech; Ortenberg, Germany) analyzed in 1-minute intervals for  60 minutes at  $37^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  . Data were assessed by Techno thro mb in TGA evaluation software  (Techno clone) using a thrombin calibration curve reference. All samples were run in  duplicate. The assay coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from   $10.9\%{-}29.0\%$   (Supporting  Information Table S1). We evaluated the correlation between thrombin peak height and  endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) using TGA measurements from local volunteers   $(n{\!\!=\!\!47)}$  . The correlation was   $\mathit{r}\!\!=0.80$  . Given the strong correlation, we did not analyze both  parameters in CHS.  

The pTG/FXIa −  phenotype was evaluated in 4,340 re-frozen and thawed samples from  Batches 2   $\scriptstyle(\mathbf{n}=575$  ) and 3   $\scriptstyle(\mathfrak{n}=3,765)$  ) by the addition of a monoclonal inhibitory anti-human  FXI antibody to the plasma during the TG assay (Hae mato logic Technologies, Inc.; Essex  Junction, VT). No samples were remaining from Batch 1 (  $\mathrm{{(n{=}998}}$  ) to allow experiments with  the anti-FXI antibody. Anti-FXI antibody was diluted in TGA buffer (Hepes-NaCl buffer  containing   $1.0\%$   BSA; Techno clone) and added to   $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of plasma at a final concentration  of  $0.1~\mathrm{mg/mL}$  . The CV of the assay with the addition of anti-FXI antibody ranged from   $32.5\%–66.0\%$   (Supporting Information Table S1).  

In additional experiments performed in plasma samples from local volunteers   $(n{=}47)$  ), FXIIa  was inhibited by the addition of corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI)   $(50\,\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{mL})$  ) (Hae mato logic  Technologies, Inc.) [20] to the TG assay as described above for anti-FXI antibody. CTI was  added alone or together with anti-FXI antibody. An equivalent volume of TGA buffer  without inhibitors was used as a control.  

Blood was also collected into citrate veni puncture tubes containing  $50\,\upmu\mathrm{g/mL}$   CTI 

 (Hae mato logic Technologies, Inc.) and into citrate tubes with a manual addition of CTI (50 

  $\upmu\mathrm{g/mL)}$  ) performed 30-seconds post-draw   $(n{=}8)$  ). CHS veni puncture and sample processing  protocols were followed for all experiments with local volunteers.  

#  Cardiovascular Disease-Related Biomarkers and Genotyping  

Biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation were measured at baseline [17, 21-24].  Fibrinogen was measured in a BBL fibrometer (Becton Dickinson, Co c keys ville, MD), CV   $3.4\%$  ; FVIIc and FVIIIc were measured on the Coag-A-Mate X2 (Organon-Teknika,  Durham, NC), CVs   $5.9\%$   and   $10.4\%$  . Interleukin-6 (IL-6)   $(\mathrm{CV}\,6.3\%)$  ), C-reactive protein 

 (CRP)   $(\mathbf{CV}\;8.9\%)$  ), and D-dimer (CV   $7.0\%$  ) were measured by ELISA using commercial 

 (Quantikine IL-6, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and in-house assays [21, 22, 24],  respectively. IL-6 and D-dimer were measured only in subjects enrolled in a case-cohort  sub-study   $\mathbf{(n{=}2,}454\mathbf{)}$  ). FVIIa was measured in  $\it{m=3,486}$   citrated plasma samples collected at  the 1992-1993 (CHS year 5) clinical exam using the Staclot VIIa-rTF assay (Diagnostic a  Stago, Inc.) (inter-assay CV   $8.7\%$  ). Hematocrit, hemoglobin, and platelet count, were  measured on automated instruments at local laboratories.  

Genotyping was performed on  ${}^{3,673\;\mathrm{EA}}$   and 676 AA CHS participants who provided  informed consent for participation in DNA studies using the ITMAT-Broad-CARe  genotyping array version 2 (IBCv2) (Illumina; San Diego, CA) containing  ${\sim}50{,}000\;\mathrm{SNPS}$     $(\sim\!2,\!100\operatorname{loc})$  ) selected for their relevance to cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory  syndromes [25]. Individuals were excluded due to inadequate DNA samples or missing TGA  data. SNPs were excluded when mono m orphic, the call rate was   ${\tt<}95\%$  , or when significant  departures from expected Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) genotype proportions were  observed   $(\mathsf{p}\!<\!10^{-5}$   in EAs). Given the genetic admixture in AAs, there was no HWE filter  used for these samples. After these exclusions were applied, data remained on 42,011 SNPs.  

#  Event Ascertainment and Definitions  

Incident cardiovascular disease and stroke events were reported during semiannual telephone  contacts by participant or proxies or at clinical visits. The primary clinical endpoints for this  study were: incident non-medical-procedure-related fatal or nonfatal MI; incident fatal or  nonfatal ischemic stroke; incident fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD; defined as  MI, coronary artery angioplasty or bypass grafting, or angina); and cardiovascular disease-or stroke-related mortality. Medical records were obtained to confirm the diagnosis, and  events were adjudicated by a physician review panel [26, 27]. For suspected stroke events,  information was collected from the participant or proxy, medical records, the participant's  physician, and CT and/or MRI scans when available. Final adjudication was performed by  vascular neurologists at a consensus conference using all available information [28]. For this  analysis, hemorrhagic strokes   $\scriptstyle(\mathbf{n}=114)$  ) and strokes of unknown subtype   $\mathrm{(n{=}73\Omega)}$  ) were  excluded. Censoring date was defined as death, loss to follow-up, study drop out, or event  date, occurring through December 31, 2011.  

#  Statistical Analysis  

Cross-sectional relationships were evaluated using linear regression with pTG phenotypes  modeled as the outcome variable, adjusted for age, sex, and race. Independent variables were  analyzed per standard deviation (SD) increment higher. Triglycerides, CRP, IL-6, and Ddimer had a non-normal distribution and were natural log-transformed. To correct for  multiple testing, results were considered statistically significant if  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.005$  . T-tests were  used to compare unadjusted pTG means by sex.  

Associations of pTG phenotypes and IBCv2 SNPs were performed using linear regression,  implemented in PLINK [29], stratified by race with covariate adjustment for age, sex, clinic,  and TGA analytical batch (EAs) or the first 10 ei gen vectors derived from principal  components analysis (AAs). SNPs were analyzed under an additive model. Results were  considered statistically significant if  $p\!\le\!2.2\!\times\!10^{-6}$   [30]. To evaluate whether FVIIa mediated  any of the association of rs1801020 with pTG, separate linear regression models were  analyzed with FVIIa included as a covariate (modeled per 1-SD increment higher).  

Relationships of pTG phenotypes with incident cardiovascular disease, stroke, and  cardiovascular- or cerebro vascular-related mortality were evaluated using Cox proportional  hazards ratios, modeled per SD increment higher or by quartiles of the distribution.  Participants with adjudicated disease at baseline relevant for each outcome were excluded  (  $\scriptstyle{\mathit{I}}_{n=516}$   participants with MI;  $_{n=223}$   with stroke, and   $\scriptstyle{n=1045}$   with CHD at baseline).  Demographic-adjusted models included age, sex, and race. Risk factor-adjusted models  included age, sex, race, smoking status, diabetes status (defined as the use of insulin, oral  hypoglycemic medications, or a fasting glucose level   $126\ \Sigma\mathrm{m}\mathrm{g/dL})$  ), hypertension status  (defined as systolic blood pressure  ${>}140\;\mathrm{mmHg}$  , diastolic blood pressure  ${\times90}\,\mathrm{mmHg}$  , or  current use of anti hypertensive medication), systolic blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol.  Mortality models included adjustment for prevalent MI, stroke, and CHD at baseline.  

#  Genetic Analyses in GAIT-2 and CHARGE  

SNPs identified as statistically significant in CHS were genotyped in the Genetic Analysis of  Idiopathic Thr ombo philia (GAIT)-2 study cohort [31] and evaluated with pTG, ETP, TG lag  time, activated partial th rom bop last in time (aPTT), FXIIc, FXIc, and FIXc using linear  regression. Thrombin generation in GAIT-2 was measured in plasma as described by  Hemker et al. [32] using the Fluoroskan Ascent assay (ThermoLab systems, Helsinki,  Finland) with  $5\,\mathrm{pM}$   TF and  $4\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   phospholipids.  

A candidate gene look-up of rs1801020 with ischemic stroke risk was assessed within the  Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium  [33, 34]. Genomewide association data generated from four prospective cohorts, including  CHS, was used to impute to the 2.5 million non mono m orphic, autosomal SNPs described in  the HapMap’s Centre d’Etude du Polymorphism e Humain collection panel among a  discovery sample of 19,602 EA participants. Analyses were performed using linear  regression adjusted for age and sex.  

#  Results  

#  Associations of peak thrombin generation (pTG) with cardiovascular disease risk factors  and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  

Baseline characteristics of CHS participants are summarized in Supporting Information  Table S2. pTG values   $\scriptstyle{(n=5,411)}$  ) were approximately normally distributed with a mean (SD)  of  $495~\mathrm{nM}$     $_{.142\;\mathrm{nM})}$  ) in the overall study population. pTG was higher in women than men,  and among participants with younger age. The unadjusted mean (SD) pTG values in women  was  $500\,\mathrm{nM}$   (  $\mathrm{142\,nM)}$  ) and  $488\;\mathrm{nm}$   (  $142\,\mathrm{nm})$  ) in men   $\left(\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.003\right)$  . In demographic-adjusted  models, pTG was positively associated with BMI, total- and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides,  CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen, D-dimer, FVIIc, FVIIa, FVIIIc, and platelet count, and inversely  associated with HDL-cholesterol, hematocrit and hemoglobin (Table 1).  

In genotyping analyses of 3,673 EA and 676 AA participants, two SNPs were significantly  associated with pTG in EAs: rs1801020   $(p{=}3.3{\times}10^{-22})$  ) and rs2545801   $(p{=}3.1{\times}10^{-21})$  ) (Table  2). The two SNPs are located in the  $F I Z$  gene encoding FXII and are in strong linkage  d is equilibrium (LD)   $(\mathrm{r}^{2}\!=\!0.96)$  . Rs1080210 is a functional SNP located four bases upstream  of the  $F I2$  transcriptional start site [35]; rs2545801 is a non-coding SNP located in the  $5'$    region upstream of the transcriptional start site.  

The mean (SD) pTG value was   $501\;\mathrm{nm}$   (  $133\;\mathrm{nm})$  ) for rs1801020 major allele homozygotes,   $477\;\mathrm{nm}$   (  $.134\,\mathrm{nM})$  ) for heterozygotes, and   $415\;\mathrm{nm}$   (  $.138\;\mathrm{nM})$   for minor allele homozygotes   $\mathsf{\tau}_{\mathrm{p}\mathrm{<}0.0001\mathrm{\tau}}$  ). The same alleles of rs1801020 and rs2545801 were associated with lower pTG  in AAs. However, the allele frequencies and LD patterns were different than those observed  for EAs   $\scriptstyle(\mathrm{r}^{2}=0.48)$  , and the associations were of nominal significance. An additional  $F I2$  SNP, rs17876032, was also associated with higher pTG in AAs   $\upbeta{=}45.0\;\mathrm{nm}$  ,  $p{=}2.0{\times}10^{-5}\$  ) 

 (Supporting Information Table S3). The associations of rs2545801   $(p{\!\!=\!\!0.22)}$   and rs17876032 

  $(p{\!\!=\!\!0.10)}$   were not conditionally independent of rs1801020 in AAs.  

#  Contributions of coagulation factor XIIa and factor XIa to pTG  

Associations of F12 SNPs with pTG suggested activated FXII (FXIIa) was important for TG  ex vivo. To test this hypothesis, we performed the TG assay in plasma samples   $(\mathit{n}\!\!=\!\!47)$  ) with  the addition of CTI to the assay   $(50\,\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{mL})$  . The addition of CTI had no effect on pTG  (Figure 1), suggesting a potential role of FXIa, a coagulation factor further downstream in  the contact coagulation pathway. To evaluate this, we performed the TG assay with the  addition of inhibitory anti-human FXIa antibody  $(\pm\;\mathrm{CTI})$   to the assay. Inhibition of FXIa  resulted in a mean  ${\sim}30\%$   reduction of pTG; co-treatment with CTI had no additional effect  (Figure 1). These results indicated the importance of FXIa on TG ex vivo.  

To determine the influence of FXII activation during sample collection and processing prior  to inhibition during the TG assay, we collected blood directly into CTI-containing  phlebotomy tubes   $\mathit{(n=8)}$  ). We also collected blood into citrate tubes and manually added CTI   $(50\,\upmu\mathrm{g/mL})$  ) 30-seconds post-draw, prior to processing and freezing   $(n{=}8)$  ). Collection into  CTI-containing tubes resulted in an   ${\sim}80\%$   reduction of pTG; the post-draw addition of CTI  resulted in an  ${\sim}27\%$   reduction (Supporting Information Figure S1). These data indicated the  immediate activation of FXII in vitro during sample collection. These results also suggested  the FXIIa-dependent activation of FXIa during sample collection and processing.  

#  Associations of FXIa-independent pTG (pTG/FXIa − ) and FXIa-dependent pTG (pTG/FXIa + )  with cardiovascular disease risk factors and common SNPs  

We next performed the TG assay in 4,340 available CHS baseline samples with the addition  of inhibitory anti-FXIa antibody to the assay. Since the addition of anti-FXIa antibody to the  assay completely inhibited FXIa [19], this phenotype represented pTG minus any  contribution of FXIa. The mean (SD) value of pTG/FXIa −  in the overall study population  

was   $165\;\mathrm{nm}$   (  $_{.119\;\mathrm{nM})}$  ); mean values were higher in women [171 nM (SD 124 nM)] than  men   $[156\;\mathrm{nm}$   (SD 110nM)]   $\mathsf{\tau}_{\mathrm{p}\mathrm{<}0.0001\mathrm{\tau}}$  ) (Table 1).  

A third phenotype,  $\mathrm{pTK/FXTa^{+}}$  , was calculated by subtracting pTG/FXIa −  from pTG. This  phenotype represented the fraction of the total pTG that was dependent on contributions of  FXIa. In the overall study population, the mean (SD) pTG/FXIa +  value was  $333~\mathrm{nM}$   (85  nM). pTG/FXIa +  was higher with older age, with minor sex differences [women:  $331~\mathrm{{nM}}$    (SD  $86\,\mathrm{{nM}}$  ); men: 338   $\mathrm{SD}\,83\,\mathrm{nM})$  )]   $(\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.006)$  ).  

The cross-sectional correlates of pTG/FXIa −  and pTG/FXIa +  phenotypes with  cardiovascular disease risk factors are shown in Table 1. Notably, current smoking and  higher BMI, total- and LDL-cholesterol, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were associated with  lower pTG/FXIa − , but higher pTG/FXIa + . Higher common carotid intima media thickness,  hypertension, and diabetes were associated with pTG/FXIa + , but not pTG/FXIa −  (Table 1).  

Three SNPs were significantly associated with pTG/FXIa −  in EAs (Table 3), including  rs1801020   $(p{=}3.9{\times}10^{-14})$  ) and rs2545801   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!5.2\!\times\!\!10^{-14})$  ), the  $F l2\,\mathrm{{SNPS}}$   associated with  pTG; and, rs657152   $(p{\!\!=\!\!4.3\!\!\times\!\!10^{-9}})$   a tag SNP for blood group O [36], located in an intronic  region in the  $A B O$  gene encoding a g lycos yl transfer as e (Table 3). Among AAs, the strongest  association of pTG/FXIa −  was with rs1801020   $(p{\!\!=\!\!2.9\!\!\times\!\!10^{-8}})$   (Table 3). No SNPs were  significantly associated with pTG/FXIa +  in either EAs or AAs (Supporting Information  Table S4).  

In analyses of EAs, associations of rs1801020 with pTG phenotypes were not attenuated by  adjustment for FVIIa. With FVIIa included in the models (adjusted for age, sex, and clinic),  the associations of rs1801020 with pTG (  $\upbeta{=}{-}33.1\ \mathrm{nm}$  ;  $\mathrm{SE}{=}4.0\;\mathrm{nm}$  ;  $p{<}0.0001\$  ) and pTG/ FXI −    $\upbeta\mathrm{=}\mathrm{-}24.2$  . nM;  $\mathrm{SE}{=}3.6\;\mathrm{nm}$  ;  $p{<}0.0001)$  ) were not substantially altered. These results  suggested the relationships of F12 SNPs with pTG were not mediated by FVIIa.  

#  Associations of pTG phenotypes with incident cardiovascular disease and ischemic  stroke  

Of the 5,411 CHS participants with pTG measurements, there were 944 incident MI, 834  incident ischemic strokes, 1,665 incident CHD, and 1,705 cardiovascular- or  cerebro vascular-related deaths over a maximum 22.5-years of follow-up (median 13.2  years). In demographic-adjusted Cox models, pTG was positively associated with incident  ischemic stroke risk, but not MI, CHD, or event-related mortality. The stroke hazard ratio  (HR) (  $95\%$   confidence interval (CI)) per SD higher pTG was 1.10 (1.03, 1.19;  $p{=}0.006)$  ).  Results were not materially altered after adjustment for risk factors (Table 4). Comparing the  fourth to the first quartile in risk factor-adjusted models, the pTG HR for ischemic stroke  was 1.25 (1.02, 1.54;  $p{=}0.04\$  ) (Supporting Information Table S5).  

In demographic-adjusted models, pTG/FXIa +  was positively associated with incident  ischemic stroke, CHD, and event-related mortality. After adjustment for risk factors, pTG/  $\mathrm{FXTa^{+}}$   remained significantly associated with ischemic stroke. The ischemic stroke HR (  $95\%$  CI) per SD higher   $\mathrm{pTa^{+}}$   was 1.11 (1.03, 1.21;  $p{\=}0.02)$  ). Comparing the fourth to the  first quartile, the stroke HR (  $95\%$   CI) was 1.17 (0.93, 1.47;  $p{\!\!=\!\!0.19},$  ). pTG/FXIa −  was not  

significantly associated with cardiovascular or stroke events (Table 4; Supporting  Information Table S5).  

In a candidate gene look-up performed in CHARGE   $\scriptstyle{\mathit{n}}=19,602)$   [34], the rs1801020 SNP  was not associated with incident ischemic stroke   $._{n=1164}$  )   $(\upbeta\!\!=\!-0.02$  ; (  $\mathrm{SE=}0.08)$  );  $\mathtt{p}{=}0.81$  )  (adjusted for age and sex).  

#  Assessment of associations in GAIT-2  

In analyses performed in GAIT-2 [31], rs1801020 was associated with lower FXIIc (  $\upbeta\!\!=$   $-30.9\%$  ;  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!1.3\!\times\!\!10^{-45}\!\!.$  ), lower FIXc   $\upbeta{=}{9.0\%}$  ;  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!9.0\!\!\times\!\!10^{-6}\!\!$  ), and longer aPTT   $\mathrm{{\backslash\beta}}{=}0.06~\mathrm{{s}}$  ; 

  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!1.4\!\!\times\!\!10^{-15}\big)$  ), but not pTG, ETP, or TG lag time   $_{(p\,>0.40)}$  . Rs657152 was associated with  higher pTG   $\upbeta{=}16.3\ \mathrm{nm}$  ;  $p{\!\!=\!\!0.01.}$  ), shorter aPTT (  $\upbeta{=}{0.03}\mathrm{\;s}$  ;  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!9.8\!\!\times\!\!10^{-8}\!\!.$  ), and higher FXIc   $\mathrm{\backslash}\upbeta{=}0.03\%$  ;  $p{\mathrel{=}}0.02)$  ), but not ETP or TG lag time   $_{(p\,>0.40)}$   (Supporting Information Table  S6).  

#  Discussion  

We have demonstrated that pTG was associated with incident ischemic stroke risk. pTG/  $\mathrm{FXTa^{+}}$  , but not pTG/FXIa − , was associated with ischemic stroke suggesting an important  contribution of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Further, we identified two SNPs in the  gene for coagulation FXII associated with lower pTG.  

Our findings are consistent with the Three-City Cohort study which demonstrated higher TG  was associated with increased risk of acute ischemic stroke, but not CHD [9]. These  consistent associations may suggest the potential utility of TG assays in stroke risk  assessment. To the best of our knowledge, by measuring both standard and FXIa-inhibited  TG, our study is the first to provide evidence that TG influenced by the intrinsic coagulation  system was prospectively associated with ischemic stroke risk in a population of older  adults. Our observational study, however, cannot establish causality.  

There is accumulating evidence implicating the intrinsic coagulation system in  at hero thrombosis. Mice with genetic ablation of FXII or FXI were protected from carotid  arterial occlusion [37, 38] and cerebral artery ischemia-reperfusion injury [39].  Epidemiological ly, higher levels of FXI were associated with increased stroke risk [40, 41]  and FXI deficiency was associated with reduced risk [13]. FXI was associated with risk of  MI in some studies [42], but not all [43, 44]. The relationships of FXII with arterial  thrombosis are uncertain [45], although recent evidence supports a role of FXII in the  regulation of fibrin clot structure and stabilization [11, 12, 46]. Relationships of F12 SNPs  with thrombotic outcomes are conflicting [47].  

We identified associations of two SNPs located in the F12 gene, rs1801020 and rs2545801,  with pTG. Rs1801020 is a well-studied common variant causing a C to T transition 4  nucleotides upstream of the transcription start codon. Carriers of the T variant lack a Kozak  consensus sequence, resulting in decreased translation and lower circulating FXII [35];  rs2545801 is in strong LD with rs1801020. Our findings are consistent with previous studies  identifying relationships of F12 SNPs with pTG [48, 49] and aPTT [49-52], and support the  importance of F12 SNPs on TG ex vivo. Associations of rs1801020 with TG measurements  were not replicated in GAIT-2. This discrepancy may reflect the different TG assays utilized  by CHS and GAIT-2. The associations of rs1801020 with FXIIc, FIXc, and aPTT in  GAIT-2, however, are consistent with a role of  $F I Z$  in coagulation ex vivo.  

Our results demonstrated that while inhibition of FXIIa by CTI during the TG assay did not  effect pTG, inhibition by CTI during blood collection had a significant effect. Inhibition of  FXIa during the TG assay also significantly reduced pTG. These data suggested the rapid  activation of FXIIa and subsequent FXIIa-dependent activation of FXIa in vitro during our  standardized sample collection and processing steps. Associations of F12 SNPs with lower  pTG indicated that genetic variation in FXII influenced levels of FXIa ex vivo [53], which in  turn effected thrombin generation ex vivo. Unexpectedly, the pTG/FXIa +  phenotype was not  associated with F12 SNPs. These null results are likely the consequence of variable  inhibition of FXIa by plasma serpins during phlebotomy and sample collection prior to  inhibition during the assay [19], and may also reflect variability resulting from pTG/FXIa +  being a calculated phenotype.  

F12 SNPs were also associated with the pTG/FXIa −  phenotype. These results implicated  FXIIa and/or FXIa in influencing activation of TF-FVIIa-mediated coagulation pathway  components ex vivo. Our results indicated relationships of F12 SNPs with pTG were not  mediated by FVIIa. Possible mechanisms explaining these relationships may include FXIadependent activation of FIX or in activation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor [54] during  sample collection and processing prior to FXIa inhibition during the assay.  

The rs1801020 SNP was not associated with stroke in CHARGE. These null results do not  implicate casual relationships between  $F I2$  and ischemic stroke. Relationships among F12,  pTG, and stroke, may be mediated by factors further down the coagulation pathway or  reflect co inheritance with other functional variants [55], and interpretation of the complex  relationships of the F12 rs1801020 SNP with thrombosis remains difficult [47].  

FXIIa and FXIa were not inhibited during blood collection in CHS and the potential for  residual activity prior to their inhibition during the assay is a technical limitation of our  study. Despite this limitation, blood collection and processing in CHS were standardized,  comparable to standardized protocols for many clinical and research assays. We used a  commercially available TG assay which contained a TF concentration that allowed for a low  sensitivity to the intrinsic coagulation pathway [56]. As such, our associations with the  intrinsic pathway are likely underestimates.  

pTG/FXIa ±  measurements were performed in 1,000 fewer samples than pTG, preventing  direct comparisons of stroke hazard ratios. We may have been underpowered to detect  associations of pTG/FXI −  with stroke and cannot rule out its potential importance. The TG  phenotypes were also highly correlated and caution is warranted in the interpretation of the  results. Information regarding ischemic stroke subtypes, and levels of FXII, FXI,  pre kalli k re in, and high-molecular-weight-kininogen are not available in CHS. Finally, we  could not evaluate racial differences due to the TG data being generated in separate  analytical batches.  

Strengths of our study include the field center technician training, standardization and  quality-assurance methods for blood collection, processing, shipping, and storage in CHS  [17]. The prospective study design and use of specific coagulation factor inhibitors are  additional strengths.  

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that pTG was associated with increased risk of  ischemic stroke. Our data suggested contributions of the contact coagulation pathway were  primarily responsible for these relationships. Further, the minor alleles for SNPs in the gene  for coagulation FXII were associated with lower pTG. These data support the importance of  contact pathway-dependent TG as a risk factor for ischemic stroke and indicate the  importance of F12 SNPs on thrombin generation both ex vivo and in vivo.

# Figure 1.  

Inhibition of coagulation factor XIa (FXIa), but not coagulation factor XIIa (FXIIa), during  the thrombin generation assay effects peak thrombin generation (pTG) ex vivo. FXIIa was  inhibited by the addition of corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI;  $50\,\upmu\mathrm{g/mL})$  ) to the plasma samples  during the thrombin generation assay. FXIa was inhibited by the addition of inhibitory  monoclonal anti-human FXI antibody (anti-FXIa;   $100\,\upmu\mathrm{g/mL}$  ) to samples during the assay   $(\pm\,\mathrm{CTI})$  . Data are means (SEM)   $(n{=}47)$  ). PL, phospholipids; TF, tissue factor.  $^{*}<\!0.0001$    compared to   $\mathrm{TF}+\mathrm{PL}$  .

Independent variables were analyzed per standard deviation increment higher (shown in parentheses). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and race  (models of age and sex were only adjusted for the two remaining variables). Triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Ddimer were natural log-transformed (ln).

Analyses using Cox proportional hazards ratios (HR) and  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CI). Peak thrombin generation (pTG) phenotypes were  evaluated per standard deviation (SD) increment higher value (shown in parentheses). Participants with adjudicated relevant disease prevalent at  baseline were excluded from the analyses. The number of measurements varies across TG categories: pTG:   $\scriptstyle{n=5,411}$  ; pTG/FXIa−:   $n{=}4{,}340$  ; pTG/  $\mathrm{FXTa+}$  :  $\it{m=4,339}$  .  

# Model 1: Age, sex, race.  

Model 2: model   $1+$   smoking status, diabetes status, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol; mortality models also included  prevalent MI, stroke, and CHD at baseline. CHD indicates coronary heart disease; CVD-related mortality indicates cardiovascular or  cerebro vascular disease-related mortality; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; MI, myocardial infarction.
