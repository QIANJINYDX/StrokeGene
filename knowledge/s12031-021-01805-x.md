# Abstract  

$\mathbf{N}^{6}$  -Methyl adenosine   $\mathrm{(m^{6}A)}$   methyl ation is the most abundant post-transcription modification in eukaryotes and plays a vital  role in many pathological conditions including cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and vascular inflammation. Moreover,  recent studies have reported that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect the   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   modification. Therefore,  we investigated the relationship between   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   and ischemic stroke (IS) risk through integrative analysis of an IS  genome-wide association study and  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$   list from the m6AVar database. Next, we performed eQTL and differential  expression analysis to support these IS-associated  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  . Finally, using the identified polymorphisms, a PPI network  was constructed using the STRING database, and GO and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID  online tool. Accordingly, we identified 305 IS-associated SNPs that could affect   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   methyl ation. Next, 158 of these SNPs  were determined to have eQTL signals on local genes. We further identified 84 local genes (containing a total of 87 SNPs)  that were differential ly expressed in IS patients. Finally, we identified several biological processes and pathways related to  IS pathogen es is, such as “leukocyte migration” and “focal adhesion.” In summary, our study detected dozens of  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$    as critical functional polymorphisms and novel genetic biomarkers for IS susceptibility and provided a new means of elucidating the biological mechanism underlying IS development.

# Introduction  

As a common neurological disorder, ischemic stroke (IS) is  among the leading causes of permanent disability and mortality worldwide (Donnan et al.  2008 ). Despite the declining  mortality rate of IS, the global IS burden is increasing and  it is estimated that by 2030, the direct and indirect costs  associated with stroke in the USA will exceed  $\S240$   billion  (Hankey  2017 ; Ovbiagele et al.  2013 ). Therefore, identify- ing novel biomarkers and elucidating the underlying biological mechanisms associated with IS are urgently important  to improve IS prevention and treatment and reduce the economic burden of this disease. In recent years, an increasing  number of studies have suggested that inflammation is an  essential process in the pathogen es is of IS (Di Raimondo  et al.  2013 ; Pinto et al.  2006 ; Tutto lomond o et al.  2015a ,  b ). Moreover, traditional risk factors for IS susceptibility,  including hypertension, diabetes, drinking, and smoking,  have been well documented, but much about this disease  remains unexplained (Feigin et al.  2016 ).  

Genetic factors, suggested by twin and family-based  studies, could contribute notably to the development of  IS (Liao et al.  1997 ; Meschia et al.  2011 ). Moreover, very  recently published genome-wide association studies (GWASs)  with large samples have identified dozens of IS-associated  variants (Kilarski et al.  2014 ; Kim and Chae  2009 ; Malik  et al.  2018 ; Network and International Stroke Genetics  2016 ;  Traylor et al.  2012 ). A major focus in the post-GWAS era  is determining whether genetic variants associated with  distinct disease phenotypes are truly functional (causative).  Currently, studies using whole-exome sequencing have  succeeded in identifying some missense variants associated  with IS occurrence (Carrera et  al.  2016 ; Ilinca et  al.  2020 ). However, few researches have focused on genetic  polymorphisms involving RNA-protein interactions, the  splicing sites of exons, and, especially,   $\mathbf{N}^{6}$  -methyl adenosine   $\mathrm{(m^{6}A)}$   methyl ation.  

The   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   RNA modification was first discovered in  1974 and refers to a methyl ation at the N6 position of  adenosine (Desrosiers et al.  1974 ). This modification  not only plays a vital role in fundamental physiological  processes, such as regulating mRNA stability and gene  expression, but also is involved in many pathological  conditions including, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury,  vascular inflammation, and cancer progression (Meyer and  Jaffrey  2014 ; Wang et al.  2020 ; Wu et al.  2019 ; Xu et al.  2020 ). Meanwhile, it has recently been reported that  $\mathrm{{m^{6}A}}.$  - associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms   $\mathrm{(m^{6}A{-}S N P s)}$  )  could affect   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   modification by changing the RNA  sequence of the target site and key flanking nucleotides,  and these SNPs are considered to be critical functional  polymorphisms in the susceptibility of various complex  diseases including coronary artery disease, multiple  sclerosis, and schizophrenia (Mo et al.  2019 ,  2018 ; Qi  et al.  2020 ; Zheng et al.  2018 ). However, to date, the  relationship between  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   and IS susceptibility has  not been elucidated. Thus, at the genome-wide level, we  investigated the impact of  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   on IS risk by using  the largest GWAS dataset and public databases, to identify  novel genetic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets  for IS.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Identification of IS‑Associated  $\pmb{\mathsf{M}}^{\pmb{\circ}}\pmb{\mathsf{A}}$  ‑SNPs  

First, we investigated the impact of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   on IS  using the largest published GWAS meta-analysis by the  MEGASTROKE consortium (Malik et al.  2018 ), which  is publicly available at  https​://www.megas​troke​.org/ downl​oad.html . This trans-ethnic GWAS meta-analysis  included 67,132 IS cases and 454,450 controls, and  the downloaded dataset contained summary results for  7,731,006 SNPs. To identify the specific   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$    that could affect   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   methyl ation among these nearly  8 million SNPs, the   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$   list was downloaded  from the m6AVar database, which currently includes  13,703 high-confidence (miCLIP/PA $\mathrm{{\cdotm^{6}A}}$  -seq), 54,222  medium-confidence (MeRIP-Seq), and 245,076 lowconfidence (transcript ome-wide prediction)  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$    for humans ( http://m6ava​r.renla​b.org/ ) (Zheng et  al.  2018 ). By merging the   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$   list with the GWAS  summary dataset, we screened out the specific   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$    associated with IS risk. Next, the SNPs with  $P$   values less  than 0.05 were considered in the next-step analysis.  

# eQTL Analysis of the Identified IS‑Associated  ­m 6 A‑SNPs  

Regarding the possible effects of the identified IS-associated   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   on RNA modification, regulation of gene  expression and, ultimately, IS pathogen es is, we investigated  their potential functions in the HaploReg tool V4.1, which  integrated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets  from thirteen individual researches conducted using various  human cells or tissues ( http://archi​ve.broad​insti​tute.org/ mamma​ls/haplo​reg/haplo​reg.php ) (Ward and Kellis  2012 ).  We also searched the GTEx database for eQTL analysis,  which included 11,688 transcript ome s across 53 tissues  from 714 donors ( https​://www.gtexp​ortal​.org/ ) (eGTEx  Project  2017 ; GTEx Consortium  2015 ). Next, we obtained  IS-associated   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   showing eQTL effects in at least  one of the above two databases. Moreover, for the   $\mathrm{{m^{6}A}}.$  - SNPs showing eQTL signals, we searched for possible  functions in transcriptional regulation, including changed  motifs and altered protein binding, in the RegulomeDB and  HaploReg databases ( http://regul​ome.stanf​ord.edu/ ).  

# Differential Expression Detection  

Following the eQTL analysis, we attempted to investigate  whether the identified IS-related genes, for which  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  displayed eQTL signals, were changed between stroke cases  and controls. The GEO database is a public database containing a large number of sequencing and microarray data on  disease-related gene expression ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/geo ). We searched the GEO database and downloaded  all three IS-related datasets (GSE16561, GSE22255, and  GSE58294). GSE16561 contained gene expression data  from total RNA in the peripheral whole blood of 39 cases  aged more than 18 years with MRI-diagnosed IS and 24 controls who were non-stroke and neurologic ally healthy (Barr  et al.  2010 ; O’Connell et al.  2016 ). GSE22255 reported  data on gene expression levels observed in peripheral blood  mono nuclear cells from 20 stroke cases and 20 age- and  sex-matched controls using Affymetrix micro arrays (Krug  et al.  2012 ). GSE58294 included gene expression profiles  in peripheral immune cells of 23 IS patients and 23 controls  (Stamova et al.  2014 ). After comparing the gene expression levels from stroke patients and controls, differential ly  expressed genes observed in at least one of the abovementioned researches were adopted, with the significance level  being set at 0.05.

# PPI Network Analysis and GO and KEGG Pathway  Enrichment Analysis  

To perform a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network,  we adopted the STRING 11.0 database ( https​://strin​g-db.org/ ) by setting the minimum required interaction  score at 0.4, employing no more than 10 inter actors and  using four interaction sources (experiments, text-mining,  co-expression, and databases) ( https​://strin​g-db.org/ ).  Gene ontology (GO) analysis is a powerful bio in format ic  tool to annotate genes, while the Kyoto Encyclopedia of  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a suite of databases for the  systematic analysis of information on biological pathways.  

To investigate IS pathogen es is, GO and KEGG pathway  enrichment analyses were performed using the Database  for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery  (DAVID) online tool ( http://david​.abcc.ncifc​rf.gov/ ).  

# Results  

# IS‑Associated ­m 6 A‑SNPs  

First of all, we selected   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   from the MEGASTROKE dataset, including nearly 8 million SNPs, based  on the annotation information of   $300,542\ \mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A-SNPs}$   in  

![](images/50e3d6d07c97f4e63229fdccde3057b7b9008c2c0b08616816d9f721567db9d8.jpg)

the m6AVar database. We detected   $4216~\mathrm{{m^{6}A{-S N P s}}}$   and   $4562\ \mathrm{m^{6}A}$   sites, which were located in protein-coding  genes as well as non-coding RNAs (Fig.  1 ). For these 4,216   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  3422, 656, and  $118\;\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$  -SNPs were classified into the low,  medium, and high confidence levels, respectively. To draw  a Manhattan plot for these  $4216\;\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}{\cdot}\mathrm{SNPS}$  , the R package  qqman was adopted with a suggestive significance threshold set at 0.05 (blue line) (Fig.  2 ). Among the identified   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  ity   $(P\!<\!0.05)$  , of which 254, 43, and 8 were classified into  the low, medium, and high confidence levels, respectively  (Table  S1 ).  

# eQTL Analysis  

In order to explore the potential functions underlying 305  IS-associated  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  , we further studied the relationship  between these SNPs and local gene expression levels by using  the HaploReg and GTEx databases. On the whole, 158 of the  detected IS-associated  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$  -SNPs exhibited eQTL effects on  the genes in which they located (Table  S2 ). Additionally, most  of these   $158\,\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$  -SNPs showed eQTL effects on various cells  and tissues. Furthermore, using HaploReg and RegulomeDB  databases, we investigated the potential function on transcriptional regulation among these SNPs and observed that 148  changed the regulatory motifs or binding ability to one or more  proteins in multiple tissues and cell types (Table  S2 ).  

# Differential Expression Detection  

Regarding these   $158\ \mathrm{m^{6}A}$  -SNPs showing eQTL effects,  we compared the mRNA expression of their local genes  between IS patients and healthy controls in three microarray  studies. In these three expression profiles, 84 differential ly  expressed genes were observed in at least one research. For  example, SPDL1   $(P{=}2.88\mathrm{E}\!-\!06)$  ), UPF3A (  $(P{=}9.17\mathrm{E}\,{-}\,05)$  ),  and LAMA5   $\left(P=1.05\mathrm{E}-03\right)$  ) in GSE165561; LIMD1   $(P\!=\!3.84\mathrm{E}-2)$  ) and ARTN   $(P\!=\!3.01\mathrm{E}-02)$   in GSE22255;  and RBM18   $(P\!=\!2.96\mathrm{E}-05)$  ), HPCAL4 (  $(P\!=\!4.13\mathrm{E}-05)$  ,

and DYRK1A   $(P\!=\!1.43\mathrm{E}-12)$  ) in GSE58294 were involved  (Fig.  3 ). Finally, we identified   $87~\mathrm{{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}}$   that could  change the expression levels of the 84 local genes and subsequently affect IS susceptibility. According to the  $P$   value  for IS risk, the top 20 IS-associated   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   showing  eQTL signals and differential expression levels of their local  genes are listed in Table  1 , and the other 57 SNPs are displayed in Table  S3 .  

# PPI Network Construction and GO/KEGG Pathway  Enrichment Analysis  

To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and  interactive relationships governing the association between  IS and   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  , a PPI network was constructed using  84 genes with differential expression, as shown in Figure  S1 . Next, we performed GO enrichment analysis, and  the results are displayed in Figure  S2 . Specifically, in the  top   $20~\mathrm{GC}$   biological process enrichment analyses, such  GO terms as “MAPK cascade” (GO: 0000165), “3 ′ -UTRmediated mRNA de stabilization” (GO: 0061158), “epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway” (GO:  0007173), and “leukocyte migration” (GO: 0050900)  were significantly enriched (Fig.  4 ). For KEGG analysis,  we also identified 13 KEGG pathways including “PI3KAkt signaling pathway” (hsa04151), “Focal adhesion” 

 (hsa04510), and “ECM-receptor interaction” (hsa04512) 

 (Fig.  4 ).  

# Discussion  

To the best of our knowledge, this report describes the first  systematic study that integrated publicly available GWAS,   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$   functional annotation, eQTL, and microarray gene  expression datasets to identify the  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$  -SNPs that affect IS  susceptibility. First, we identified 305 IS-associated SNPs  that could affect  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   methyl ation. Next, 158 of these SNPs  showed eQTL effects on local genes, and most could change  protein-binding capacity or regulatory motifs. Finally, we  observed that among these 158 SNPs, 84 local genes (87  SNPs) were differential ly expressed in IS patients and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism governing IS  occurrence. Our results further supported that   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$  could be considered to be critical functional polymorphisms  and novel genetic biomarkers for complex human diseases,  including IS.  

As the most abundant post-transcription modification in  eukaryotes,   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   modification can influence the maturation,  transcription, localization, and translation of not only mRNA  but also transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA and non-coding RNA  (Roignant and Soller  2017 ). The  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   are generally very  close to the methyl ation site. Thus, when   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   modification is  changed due to genetic variant, the biological process involved  may be affected (Zheng et al.  2018 ). Besides, when an  $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$    is located in the UTR region, the binding ability to RNA-binding protein or transcriptional regulator may be affected as well.  Similarly, in addition to affecting   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   methyl ation, when an   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}.$  -SNP is annotated as a missense variant, it could alter the  amino acid composition or secondary structure content of the  encoded protein. Thus, the biological effect of  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$  -SNP may be  derived from the accumulation of various functions.  

In traditional GWAS, stringent multiple-testing correction  and significance threshold were required for hypothesis-free  testing to avoid numerous false-positive results (Sham and  Purcell  2014 ). However, when using strict criteria, some  true associations may be masked in the GWAS dataset. In  this study, through the use of a hypothesis-driven analysis  method, we detected dozens of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   that have not  reached the significance threshold of  $5.0\mathrm{E-}08$  . For example,  the  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$  -SNP rs1803439   $P\!=\!0.006$  ) is located in the 3 ′ UTR  region of DYRK1A at chromosome 21. It is expected that  rs1803439 would affect   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   methyl ation and may change  the binding ability to RNA-binding proteins, including  SUPT5H and POLR2A, thereby regulating the expression  of DYRK1A. In the post-GWAS era, it is important to clarify  possible functional polymorphisms that fail to meet a strict  threshold. Our study may provide an effective strategy for  identifying these novel functional SNPs and helping to finemap GWAS signals.  

In the present study, we also identified multiple candidate  genes, GO terms, and KEGG pathways.   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   can  change  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   methyl ation and lead to IS, thereby providing  a new means of elucidating the biological mechanisms  governing IS development. Our systematic analysis noted  out the novel role of DYRK1A in ischemic stroke. First,  DYRK1A encodes a proline-directed serine-threonine kinase  that plays a critical role in signal transduction in various  biological processes (Abbassi et al.  2015 ). Recently, this  gene has been reported to participate in vascular endo the li al  cell proliferation and angiogenic response in  vitro by  regulating vascular endo the li al growth factor–dependent  transcriptional response, which was further confirmed by the  defect of retinal vascular iz ation in DYRK1A heterozygous  mice (Rozen et al.  2018 ). Second, DYRK1A is located  in the critical genetic region of Down syndrome (DS) on  chromosome 21, and its excessive activity is considered a  pathogenic factor in DS. Moreover, DS was associated with  an elevated risk of IS (  $(\mathrm{RR}\,{=}\,2.70$  ,   $95\%$   CI 2.08–3.53), but  not coronary events (Sobey et al.  2015 ). Thus, our findings  combined with the above experimental and clinical data  indicated a causal relationship between DYRK1 and IS  susceptibility. Besides, our study also identified LAMA5  as a potential new target in IS development. LAMA5  encodes one of the vertebrate laminin alpha chains, which  is an important component of the extracellular matrix  (Sampaolo et al.  2017 ). In vitro, LAMA5 was essential  for promoting neuron survival, network formation, and  functional development (Hyysalo et al.  2017 ). Further  studies also identified LAMA5 as a stabilizer of dendritic  spines and synapses in the brain (Omar et al.  2017 ). In vivo,  in mouse brain following intra cerebral hemorrhage, LAMA5  conditional knockout mice showed increased neuronal death  and injury volume and worsening neurological function,  indicating that LAMA5 may have multiple neuro protective  effects (Gautam et al.  2019 ).  

GO enrichment analysis detected an inflammation-related  GO term (leukocyte migration, GO: 0050900), and KEGG  pathway analysis also identified focal adhesion (hsa04510)  in the pathogen es is of IS. Recent prospective cohort studies  indicated that the leukocyte count can predict long-term IS  events, showing that peripheral blood leukocytes, as major  components of the immuno-inflammatory response, may be  a crucial factor in IS development (Elkind et al.  2005 ; Wu  et al.  2013 ). Meanwhile, most known leukocytes are present  and play important roles in human at hero sclerotic lesions  (Galkina and Ley  2009 ). For example, monocyte-derived  macrophages can produce pro inflammatory cytokines,  such as TNF ${\bf\nabla}\cdot{\bf\alpha}$  , IL-6, and IL-1, causing endo the li al cell  injury and vascular wall inflammation (Galkina and Ley  2009 ). Thus, leukocyte migration and focal adhesion to  vascular endo the li al cells can be regarded as a critical  initial step of vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, and  subsequent cerebral thrombus formation. Moreover, our  enrichment analysis demonstrated that   $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   modification  may participate in the development of IS by regulating the  above mentioned biological process and pathway.  

This study has several potential limitations that should  be noted. First, the relationship of the detected   $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}\cdot$  SNPs and IS susceptibility was not confirmed in other  independent studies. Nevertheless, these polymorphisms  have been found in the largest IS GWAS dataset. Thus,  the correlation should be robust. Second, the mRNA  expression microarray analyses of IS were performed on  RNA obtained from peripheral blood cells, while most  of the eQTL signals detected on the HaploReg or GTEx  databases came from other cells or tissues. Thus, in the  same cell or tissue, the relationship of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P}$  , gene  expression level, and IS still needs to be investigated.  Third, the sample size of mRNA expression micro arrays  was significantly smaller than that of the IS GWAS,  indicating that interpretation of these differential ly  expressed genes requires caution. Last but not the  least, most of the detected   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   belonged to low  and medium confidence levels, and the effects of these  polymorphisms, especially on  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   methyl ation, have not  been confirmed through functional studies. Therefore,  further molecular experiments are required to investigate  their specific effects by using animal models and cell lines.  

# Conclusion  

Overall, the results of our study suggest that dozens of   $\mathrm{m^{6}A{-}S N P s}$   may be novel genetic biomarkers and potential  therapeutic targets for IS development. Further studies are  warranted to replicate our findings and clarify how genetic  polymorphisms affect  $\mathrm{m^{6}A}$   modification and subsequent  functions in IS pathogen es is.
