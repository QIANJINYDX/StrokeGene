Background:  Pediatric ischemic stroke is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. As previous studies of children after stroke showed, dys lipid emi as were very common in Polish and other European populations. Thus, looking for genetic factors predisposing to pediatric stroke, its symptoms, and outcome, we have analyzed 2 polymorphisms of the upstream stimulating factor 1 ( USF-1 ) gene.  Materials and Methods:  The study group consisted of 82 children with stroke, 156 parents, and 146 controls. We used 2 alternative methods: the case–control model and the analysis of families using the transmission d is equilibrium test. The 2 polymorphisms, rs2516839 and rs3737787, were genotyped using the TaqMan PreDesigned SNP Genotyping Assay. The Statistica 10.0 software was used in all statistical analyses.  Results:  We did not observe any statistical differences in genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls. There were also no signiﬁcant differences in the transmission of alleles from the parents to the affected children. However, we have observed that the TT genotype of the rs2516839 polymorphism was more common in patients with epilepsy and dysarthria, whereas the TT genotype of the rs3737787 polymorphism was more frequent in the group of patients with a decrease in intellectual functioning.  Conclusions:  Our study did not show any associations between the 2 analyzed polymorphisms of the  USF-1  

gene and pediatric ischemic stroke. However, we have observed an inﬂuence of speciﬁc genotypes on the outcome of stroke, including epilepsy, dysarthria, and a decrease in intellectual functioning.

# Introduction  

Arterial ischemic stroke has a rather low frequency in children compared with adults; however, it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this age group. Additionally, most children after stroke have long-term neurological deﬁcits, which make the disease an important medical and sociological problem. About  $20\%40\%$  of children have recurrent strokes, and a better knowledge of the pathogen es is of the disease may not only sign i cant ly improve its treatment but also help to avoid recurrent incidents. The risk factors of pediatric stroke include congenital heart disease, vas cul op athies, hematologic disorders, and pro thr ombo tic states; however, in many cases, the etiology remains unknown.  

Previous studies of children after ischemic stroke have shown that dys lipid emi as were very common in Polish  $(70\%)$   and other European   $(85\%)$   populations.   In adults, lip o metabolic disorders may be sign i cant ly affected by environmental factors, but in children, due to the young age, genetic variations seem to be a more plausible explanation for such abnormalities. There are very few studies analyzing possible associations between polymorphisms of genes involved in lipid metabolism and pediatric stroke.   Upstream stimulating factor 1 ( USF-1 ) is one of the genes that are largely involved in lipid metabolism. The protein encoded by this gene is a ubiquitously expressed cellular transcription factor, which participates in the regulation of many different genes, such as fatty acid synthase, apo lipoprotein s, and hepatic lipase.  USF-1 is also involved in many other processes, such as stress, immune response, cell cycle, proliferation, and glucid metabolism.  

The aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible role of 2  USF-1  gene polymorphisms, namely, rs2516839 and rs3737787, in the risk, symptoms, and outcome of pediatric ischemic stroke. The rs3737787 polymorphism is located in the   $3^{\prime}$   untranslated region (UTR) and the rs2516839—in the   $5^{\prime}$   UTR region of the  USF-1 gene. The promoter region in  $5^{\prime}$   UTR plays a key role in the initiation of transcription and the recruitment of transcriptional factors. Polymorphisms within the regulatory regions such as  $3^{\prime}$   UTR or  $5^{\prime}$   UTR can affect the transcription and mRNA stability, leading to an abnormal expression of  USF-1 .   Such genotype-dependent  USF-1 expression was found in at hero sclerotic plaques. There are also studies associating these polymorphisms with serum total, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apo lipoprotein B levels, which may suggest their functional role.  

# Materials and Methods  

Participants  

The study group consisted of 384 individuals, including 82 patients, 156 parents of children with stroke, and 147 control children. To collect as large a group of patients as possible, the Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics collaborated with leading national centers for pediatric neurology—the Department of N europa edi at ric s at the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice   $\mathrm{(n=43)}$  , the Department of Developmental Neurology at the Medical University of Gdansk   $(\mathsf{n}=18)$  ), the Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Neurology at the Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow  $(\mathsf{n}=11)$  ), and the Department of Neurology at the Polish Mother’s Memorial Hospital Research Institute in Lodz

  $\mathrm{(n=10)}$  ). The age of the children ranged from .5 to 18 years

 (mean age  $8.8\pm5.6)\$  ) at the time of diagnosis, and from 1 to 27 years (mean age   $13.4\pm6.7\$  ) at the time of the followup. Of the total children,  $47.6\%$   were girls and  $52.4\%$   were boys. The control group was age- and sex-matched, and consisted of children with no history of ischemic stroke or other vascular diseases. The age of the control children ranged from 2 months up to 18 years (mean age  $7.5\pm5.1)$  ). Of the total control children,   $42.2\%$   were girls and   $57.8\%$   were boys. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, and written consent was submitted by the patients’ parents. At the time of stroke diagnosis, the following variables were analyzed: hemiplegia; hemiparesis; nerve VII paresis; consciousness disturbances; headache, vertigo, or dizziness; and aphasia. During the follow-up examination, we observed hemi pares is, epilepsy, other movement disorders, a decrease in intellectual functioning, and dysarthria.  

# Genetic Analysis  

The study was conducted using 2 experimental models: the ﬁrst was a classic case–control analysis, and the second was a family-based approach with the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes using the MasterPure genomic DNA pur i cation kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The USF-1  gene polymorphisms, rs2516839 and rs3737787, were genotyped using the TaqMan Pre-Designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reaction mix   $(20~\upmu\mathrm{L})$  ) included   $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix,   $1\;\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of probe (TaqMan PreDesigned SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems),  $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of a DNA template   $(15\,\mathrm{ng}/\upmu\mathrm{L})$  , and  $8\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of deion- ized water. The probe was diluted with the Tris-EDTA buffer (1:1) before the reaction. Polymerase chain reaction amp li cation was performed according to the manufacturer’s spec i cations. Genotyping was performed using the 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The correctness of genotyping both polymorphisms was checked by regen o typing   $15\%$   of the samples. Repeatability of results was   $100\%$  .  

# Statistical Analysis  

Allele frequencies were assessed on the basis of the genotype distribution. Then, in all groups, the Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the    $\chi^{2}$    test. One of the methods used for the analysis of a possible relationship between the  USF-1  gene polymorphisms and stroke was the transmission–d is equilibrium test.   The test was based on the analysis of the transmission of specific alleles from the heterozygous parents to their children affected by the disease. If there is no association between the allele and the disease, the transmission of this speciﬁc allele from a parent to a child is expected to be  $50\%$  . If there is an association between the allele and the disease, an excess transmission to the offspring is observed. The frequencies of transmitted alleles observed in the study were compared with the expected frequencies using the  $\chi^{2}$    test. The second model we used to evaluate a possible association was the case–control study. The genotype and allele frequencies were compared between patients and children without stroke using the    $\chi^{2}$    test. We also analyzed possible associations between the genotypes, clinical symptoms, and consequences of stroke. In this case, we used a cross-tabulation analysis. Variables were compared using the  $\chi^{2}$    test. As a measure of association between 2 variables, Cramér  $V$   was used. Cramér    $V$   varies between 0 and 1. When close to 0, the Cramér    $V$   shows little association between variables; when close to 1, the Cramér    $V$   indicates a strong association.  

To analyze quantitative variables, we assessed the normality of distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and then a comparison of data was performed by using the Student    $t$   test (because all variables had a normal distribution). The Statistica 10.0 software was used in all statistical analyses.  

# Results  

# General Characteristics  

The main symptoms observed at the time of the diagnosis were central facial nerve paresis   $(81.8\%$   of the children) and hemi pares is   $(74.2\%)$  . More than half of the patients had impaired consciousness   $(56.7\%)$  , aphasia occurred in  $46.3\%,$  , and headaches in  $45.5\%$  . Seizures   $(18.8\%)$  ) and hemiplegia   $(15.6\%)$   were least likely to occur. Regarding the class i cation of ischemic stroke types, partial anterior circulation infarct   $(43.3\%)$   was the most common, then total anterior circulation infarct   $(21.7\%)$  , lacunar infarct  $(20\%)$  , and posterior circulation infarct   $(15\%)$  ).   In the follow-up examination, the main symptom was hemiparesis   $(77.3\%)$  . Worsening of intellectual function   $(21.4\%)$  , poststroke epilepsy   $(17.2\%)$  , dysarthria  $(7.8\%)$  , and other motor disabilities   $(21.9\%)$   were less common.  

# Genotype Analysis  

We have analyzed 50 full families using the transmission– d is equilibrium test for the rs2516839 polymorphism. There were 43 informative trios (families with at least 1 heterozygous parent), which we used to deduce which allele had been transmitted from a parent to the affected child. The transmission of all alleles is shown in the  Table 1 . We observed a tendency to a higher transmission of the C allele. The difference was not statistically signiﬁcant; however, it was on the border of sign i can ce. For the rs3737787 polymorphism, we evaluated 52 families, including 38 informative trios. There were no signiﬁcant differences in the transmission of  $\mathrm{T}$   and C alleles.  

The genotype frequencies in both patients and the control group were consistent with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. We did not observe any statistical differences in genotype and allele frequencies using the case–control model ( Table 2 ). However, there was a tendency to a higher prevalence of CC genotypes of the rs2516839 polymorphism in the stroke children group versus the control group  $(21.9\%$   versus   $13.4\%$  ,    $\chi^{2}=2.77.$  ,    $P=.096$  ).  

The analysis of clinical symptoms did not reveal any associations with speciﬁc genotypes. However, an analysis of the outcome of stroke showed that some characters were genotype dependent ( Table 3 ). In the subgroup of patients with poststroke epilepsy,   $67\%$   were TT homozygotes of the rs2516839 polymorphism; however, the frequency of the TT genotype in patients without epilepsy was only   $29.8\%$  . The same genotype was also more frequent in patients with dysarthria than in those without this disorder   $80\%$   versus  $32.8\%$  ). The TT genotype of the

# Discussion  

Our results did not show any associations between the 2 analyzed polymorphisms of the  USF-1  gene and pediatric ischemic stroke. However, we have observed a tendency to a higher occurrence of CC homozygotes of the rs2516839 polymorphism in patients compared with control children. The result was also conﬁrmed by the TDT. Although no preferential transmission of any allele from parents to affected children was observed, there was a tendency to a higher transmission of the C allele of the rs2516839 polymorphism. Using the 2 models of research, the TDT method and the case–control model, gives more reliable results because the TDT allows avoidance of possible errors associated with the selection of the control group. Similar results obtained in both models seem to conﬁrm that the results are reliable despite the small size of the study group. Taking together these results, we can conclude that, although we did not show an association between the rs2516839 polymorphism and pediatric stroke, it would be worthwhile to repeat this evaluation in a bigger group of patients because some clear tendencies were observable. There are no previous studies determining an association between the analyzed polymorphisms, neither in children nor in adults. However, Wang et al 13   showed that in adults, the rs2516839 polymorphism was associated with a total unstable carotid plaque area in patients with stroke, suggesting it could be a new marker to predict the risk of recurrence for the disease. In another study on young adults, the rs3737787 polymorphism inﬂuenced the carotid artery intima–media thickness, which is a marker of a cardiovascular disease and stroke.  

Although in our study there were no signiﬁcant associations between the analyzed polymorphisms and stroke, we have obtained some very interesting results concerning the inﬂuence of speciﬁc genotypes on the outcome of stroke. The TT genotype of the rs2516839 polymorphism was related to epilepsy and dysarthria, whereas the TT genotype of the rs3737787 polymorphism was associated with a decrease in intellectual functioning. In the brain,  USF-1  is expressed at a particularly high level. Interestingly,  USF-1  knockout mice occasionally develop

spontaneous epileptic seizures, which suggest its potential importance in normal brain function.   It is difficult to say if the association between the studied polymorphisms and stroke outcome may result from their inﬂuence on the level of triglycerides. Although there are studies showing that triglyceride concentration is independently associated with the survival of adult patients with acute stroke,   there are no data on pediatric stroke and other consequences of stroke. We suppose that the inﬂuence of the studied polymorphisms may rather result from the role of the  USF-1  gene in the regulation of some genes involved in the immune response. It is known that differences in concentrations of some in amma tory factors are associated with the degree of neurological deﬁcit or stroke outcome,   and that the  USF-1  transcription factor may regulate genes encoding some of them, for example, interleukin (IL)-10 or IL-6.   What is interesting is that our previous study showed that the IL-6 polymorphism was also associated with poststroke epilepsy.   Obviously, the role of the  USF-1  gene in the transcription regulation is so complex that an interpretation of our data is a big challenge and necessitates further studies. However, if the observed inﬂuence of speciﬁc genotypes on the outcome of stroke is proven, it may have signiﬁcant clinical implications. Perhaps adjusting therapy to speciﬁc genotypes could improve its efficiency.  

The main limitation of the study was the small number of patients, which results from the low frequency of childhood stroke.  

In conclusion, our study did not show any associations between the 2 analyzed polymorphisms of the  USF-1 gene and pediatric ischemic stroke. However, we have observed the inﬂuence of speciﬁc genotypes on the outcome of stroke, including epilepsy, dysarthria, and a decrease in intellectual functioning.
