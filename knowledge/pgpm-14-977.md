Background:  Inflammation proteins play an important role in stroke occurrence.  IL1A,  IL1B, PTGS2, MMP2 , and  MMP9  were the mediators involved in the immune response, and  the association of these genetic variations with ischemic stroke (IS) risk was still unclear.  

Methods:  To investigate the susceptibility of genetic variations of  IL1A, IL1B, PTGS2,  MMP2 , and  MMP9  to IS risk, we performed a case–control study involving 299 patients and  300 controls in a Chinese population. Thirteen genetic variations of investigated genes of all  participants were genotyped using an improved multiplex ligase detection–reaction  technique.  

Results:  No SNP in all genes showed an association with overall IS. However, in subgroup  analysis,  PTGS2  rs689466 (dominant model: CT vs   $\mathrm{TT}\mathrm{~-~}\mathrm{OR}_{\mathrm{advection}}=2.51$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.22– 

 5.16,  $p=0.012$  ; co-dominant model: CT/CC vs TT –   $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSY}}}^{=2.53}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.26–5.07, 

  ${\tt p}=0.009$  ; additive model –   $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSY}}}^{=}\,2.26$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.19–4.28,   $p\,=\,0.013\$  ) and rs5275 

 (dominant model: GG vs AA –   $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSY}}}\!=0.31$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.12–0.80,  $p=0.016$  ; co-dominant  model: GA/GG vs AA –  $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSY}}}^{=0.45}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.21–0.95,  $p=0.036$  ; additive model –   $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSed}}}\!\!=0.60$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.39–0.92,  $p=0.020\$  ) were associated with IS type of small-vessel  occlusion.  

Conclusion:  Our study suggested that  PTGS2  rs689466 C and rs5275 A were potentially  associated with IS subtype of small-vessel occlusion. Our result should be confirmed with  further large sample sized studies.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a neurological disease caused by vascular, leading to considerably high  disability and mortality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors  Study (GBD) showed that stroke and ischemic heart were the top cause of disability  over the age of 50. Depending on regional epidemiology, stroke is classified as  ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke, and the most common of which is IS,  accounting for   $87\%$   of all stroke patients.  

In the clinical setting, according to the etiology of ischemic, five subtypes were  divided for IS, which was developed for the TOAST study: 2  1) large-artery at hero scl ero­ sis, 2) small-vessel occlusion, 3) car dio embolism, 4) other determined etiology, and 5)  undermined etiology. The most common cause of ischemic is due to arterial occlusion,  and the rarer cause is cerebral veins or venous sinuses. There are many causes of stroke,  such as hypertension, diabetes, dys lipid emi a, smoking, and genetic background.  Especially, genetic background accounts for   $30–40\%$   of IS.  

Inflammation contributes across the spectrum of IS. Firstly, inflammation might not only promote thrombus for­ mation but also inhibit endogenous fi bri no lysis to enhance  clot stability. Secondly, the inflammatory mediators pro­ mote immune cells and solutes into the brain parenchyma  and damage the blood–brain barrier further, and contribute  the thr ombo genesis. , Moreover, some inflammatory med­ iators might be the predictor factors of IS clinical  outcome. , Multiple inflammation-associated mediators  are involved in the process. For example, the interleukin  (IL)-1 family, as a highly active pro inflammatory cytokine, is  a main regulator of inflammation and triggers inflammatory  cascade response by binding to the IL1 receptor.  $^{12}I L I A$    and   $I L I B$    are distinct members of  $I L I$    genes and encode  $\operatorname{LL1a}$   and 

  $\mathrm{{IL18}}$  , respectively. Experimental studies show that abnormal 

  $\mathrm{LL1a}$   and   $\mathrm{LL18}$   levels will lead to inflammatory diseases 12  and involve a variety of cellular activities, including adhesion  molecule induction and pro coagulant activity, which present  a higher inflammatory reaction and affect the development of  atherosclerosis resulting in IS. Studies showed   $\mathrm{{IL18}}$   had  14  significantly higher blood levels for stroke and contribute  to the occurrence of stroke. Prostaglandin-endo peroxide  synthase (PTGS2), known as COX2, is an important induced  enzyme in vascular endo the li al cells, smooth muscle cells,  and platelets. It is induced by cytokines and growth factors 16  and is closely associated with the formation of  atherosclerosis. Multiple studies reported an association  between  PTGS2  genetic polymorphisms and IS risk. , Matrix metal lo protein as es (MMPs), as a category of proteo­ lytic zinc-dependent enzymes, play an important role in the  degradation of the extracellular matrix and take part in the  progression of atherosclerosis by triggering the migration  and proliferation of smooth muscle cells and by causing  de stabilization of at hero sclerotic plaques. Previously, stu­ dies have reported that the MMPs protein levels elevate result  in blood–brain barrier dysfunction and impact the extent of  the infarct, and the polymorphisms of  MMP s have been  evaluated in IS. , The association with IS of   $M M P s$    is  focused on  MMP2  and   $M M P9^{26}$  , and the high expression  level of MMP2 and MMP9 has been reported that was  associated  with  increased  risk  of  IS  and  major  , disability.  

Given the putative role of the above gene involved in  the occurrence of IS, to identify the risk of the genetic  background to IS risk, we conducted a case–control asso­ ciation study to assess the association between 13 single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP s ) in  IL1B, IL1A, PTGS2,  MMP9, MMP2 , and risk of IS.  

# Materials and Methods Study Subjects  

A total of 299 patients diagnosed based on clinical symp­ toms, physical examination, and head computed tomogra­ phy or magnetic resonance imaging, and 300 healthy  controls were enrolled in this case–control study. All  patients presented with signs and symptoms lasting more  than 24 hours which sudden onset of focal or global  neurological deficits. Patients with a history of transient  ischemic attacks, hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral trauma,  car dio geni c thrombosis, coagulation disorders, autoim­ mune disease, tumors, or peripheral vascular disease  were excluded. The etiology of IS was classified according  to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment  (TOAST) as large-artery atherosclerosis, car dio embolism,  small-vessel atherosclerosis, and stroke of other etiology.  

Healthy control subjects were recruited during the same  period from the Health Medical Center of Nanjing First  Hospital. The healthy controls were confirmed according to  the routine health examination results. For the controls, the  he mato logic diseases, tumors, autoimmune diseases, liver  ailments, and genetic diseases were excluded. All enrolled  participants come from the same geographic region: Nanjing  City, Jiangsu, China. The patient information was collected  from the hospital information system, and the health control  information was from questionnaires. Declaration of  Helsinki and all procedures were approved by the  Institutional Review Board of Nanjing First Hospital, and  all participants were written informed consent.  

# DNA Extraction and Genotyping  

The SNPs of  IL1A, IL1B, PTGS2, MMP2 , and  MMP9  were selected and retrieved from the National Center for  Biotechnology Information dbSNP database ( https://www.  ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ), and then selected potential genes  based on the following criteria: 1) positioned in exons,  promoter regions, 5ʹUTRs, 3ʹUTRs, or splice sites; 2)  minor-allele frequency  ${\geq}5\%$  ; and 3) had been reported to  be associated with IS risk. Finally, thirteen genetic varia­ tions were selected (see  Table S1  for details). The DNA  extraction and genotyping were performed as previously  described. Genotyping used a method based on an  improved multiplex ligase detection reaction technique  developed by Genesky Biotech (Shanghai, China). In  detail, firstly, genetic-variation loci were amplified by  multiplex polymerase chain reaction, and then the ampli­ fication products were purified with nuclease and shrimp  alkaline enzyme. Finally, each locus contained two 5ʹterm­ inal allele-specific probes and a 3ʹterminal-specific probe  of fluorescent tags, and ligation products were analyzed  with an ABI 3730XL finally.  

# Statistical Analysis  

For the distribution of genotypes, a goodness-of-fit Chi-square test was adopted to test the Hardy–Weinberg equi­ librium (HWE) in the control group. Differences in the  demographic characteristics of the two groups were   $\chi^{2}$    assessed by   $t\cdot$  -test or  test. Logistic regression was  applied to calculate the susceptibility of polymorphisms  to IS risk with ORs and   $95\%$   CIs based on different  genetic models: Dominant model (Rare allele homozygote 

 (RR) or heterozygous (WR) vs wild-type homozygote 

 (WW) genotypes), co-dominant model   $(\mathrm{RR+WR}$   vs  WW), and additive model (WW vs WR vs RR).  $\mathrm{~P~}<$  0.05 was considered statistically significant.  

# Results  

# Characteristics of the Study Population  

A total of 299 patients with IS and 300 healthy controls  were enrolled in this study. Their demographic data and  clinical characteristics are summarized in  Table S2 . There  were no significant statistical differences in sex   $(p{=}0.312)$  , drinking   $(p{=}1.000)$  , or chol   $(p{=}0.623)$  , but  there were significant differences between the two groups  with age   $(p{<}0.001)$  , smoking   $(p{<}0.001)$  , hypertension 

  $(p{<}0.001)$  . For clinical characteristics, levels of TG 

  $(p{<}0.001)$  , GLU   $(p{<}0.001)$  , HYC   $(p{<}0.001)$  ), and CRP 

  $(p{<}0.001)$   were significantly higher in patients than in  controls. In contrast, levels of HDL in patients were  significantly lower than in controls   $(p{=}0.004)$  ). A total of  56 patients were identified as having small-vessel occlu­ sion, 116 having large-artery, 28 having car dio embolism,  and 99 having other etiologies. The HWE result showed  that all genotypes were not derived from controls  ( Table S1 ).  

# Association Between and Risk of Stroke  

Logistic regression analysis revealed that no SNP showed  any association with the risk of IS in all genes ( Table 1 )  and subgroup stratified by sex ( Table 2 ). However, sub­ group analysis by subtypes of IS showed that  PTGS2  rs689466 (dominant model: CT vs TT –   $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSed}}}^{=2.51}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.22–5.16,  $p{=}0.012$  ; co-dominant model: CT/CC  vs TT –   $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSed}}}^{=2.53}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.26–5.07,   $p{=}0.009$  ;  

additive model –   $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{adjuset}}}\!\!=\!\!2.26,$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.19–4.28,   $p{=}0.013)$  ) was associated with increased risk of IS type of  small-vessel occlusion. However, the  PTGS2  rs5275 

 (dominant model: GG vs AA –   $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSed}}}^{=0.31}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 

 0.12–0.80,  $p{=}0.016$  ; co-dominant model: GA/GG vs AA – 

  $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSed}}}^{=0.45}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.21–0.95,   $p{=}0.036$  ; additive  model –   $\mathrm{OR_{\mathrm{RMSed}}}^{=0.60}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.39–0.92,   $p{=}0.020)$  )  were associated with decreased risk of IS type of small-vessel occlusion. Additionally, the SNP  MMP9  rs3918242  was observed to be susceptible to the card i oem boli c sub­ type of IS with dominant model (CT vs   $\mathrm{CC\mathrm{~-~}O R_{a}}$  djusted   $\mathsf{=}0.31$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.11–0.91,  $p{=}0.033$  ) but not other genetic  models ( Table 3 ). No other genotypes were observed sig­ nificant differences in stroke risk.  

# Discussion  

The population-based case–control association study had  not observed associated SNPs with overall IS. However,  PTGS2  rs689466 (C allele) and rs5275 (A allele) were  associated with IS subtype of small-vessel occlusion.  

Inflammatory proteins play an important role in the  pathogen es is of stroke. Inflammatory genes, such as  C-reactive protein   $(C R P)$  , interleukin ( IL ) 6, transforming  growth factor   $\upbeta1$   ( TGFB1 ), were identified to contribute to  stroke risk. , It is well known that the elevated levels  of inflammatory markers may reflect a high burden of  atherosclerosis and thrombosis, which contribute to the  , occurrence of IS.  

PTGS2 , with loci on chromosome 1, is an inducible  enzyme that catalyzes arachidonic acid into prostaglandin s  and plays a vital role in inflammation. The expression of   $P T G S2$    is increased significantly in stroke with inflammatory  cells infiltrating, and relevant studies have reported that it is  associated with IS. The rs689466 ( PTGS2  −1195T>C) is  located in the  PTGS2  promoter, and the   $-1195\mathrm{T}$   allele dis­ plays a higher PTGS2 level than the   $-1195\mathrm{C}$   allele. The  rs5275   $\mathrm{(8473A{>}G)}$  ) is located in  PTGS2   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR, and the  8273A allele could regulate  PTGS2  higher expression by  maintaining the stability of   $\mathit{P T G S2}~\mathrm{mRNA},$  , indicating  rs5275A allele, associated with increased  PTGS2  expression,  induce the risk of IS. According to our study, rs689466 (C  allele) and rs5275 (A allele) were associated with small-vessel occlusion whether dominant model or additive  model, but have no significant difference in all IS. The reason  may be that PTGS2 induces thrombosis 17  which causes  thrombotic occlusion of small vessels. Chen reported that  rs689466 was associated with all IS and the effects were  confined to small-vessel occlusion but not large-artery.

Shan also showed that rs689466 was associated with small  vessel disease, which was consistent with our results.  However, Zhao reported that rs68944 has a higher risk in  LAA was dissimilar to our study, but its gene–gene inter­ actions of three  PTGS  genes including rs689466 were an  association with small vessel occlusion. For rs5275, another  PTGS2 associate gene, few studies have discussed the asso­ ciation between rs5275 and stroke risk to date, but it was  reported that was impacted the IS outcome. Our study  showed that rs5275 was associated with small-vessel occlu­ sion as well as rs689466, so more large sample studies need  to be conducted.  

MMP9  locates on chromosome 20q12–q13, is a member  of the MMP family, and plays a role in the progression of  IS. The  MMP9  rs3918242, within the promoter region   $(-1562\mathrm{~C>T})$  , T allele led to a higher promoter activity of  the  MMP9 . The conclusions of rs3918242 T allele for  stroke risk were controversial. A meta-analysis includ­ ing 14 control studies with 3233 IS patients and 3123 con­ trols showed that  MMP9  rs3918242 variants contributed to  increasing the risk of IS, and the report showed that T allele  carriers of rs3918242 polymorphism probably contributed to  increasing in IS than C allele. However, our study shows that  CT decreases the risk of card i oem boli c stroke than CC. The  reason for the contradiction with previous studies may be due  to smaller patients included in this study in that only 7  patients with CT genes and no TT genes among the patients  with card i oem boli c stroke in this study, which may affect the  statistical power. Moreover, there was no significant differ­ ence under the additive model. For the difference above, our  result should be verified by further large sample sized study.  

A total of thirteen SNPs were also included in this study.  Although these SNPs have been reported to affect the expres­ sion of some inflammatory proteins that contribute to the risk

of IS, no statistically significant association was observed;  thus, large-sample studies should be confirmed in the  Chinese population. Admittedly, there were some limitations  of this study, such as, the genes enrolled in this study may be  affected by many SNPs, here we selected some of them,  therefore our study was not comprehensive enough; more­ over, the study failed to assess the protein expression in  patients, which protein plays a decisive role; finally, the  sample size of this study was relatively small, which may  affect the statistical power.

Note :  a Adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and drinking; the results with a significant difference are in bold.  

In summary, our study suggested that  PTGS2  rs689466  C and rs5275 A were potentially associated with IS sub­ type of small-vessel occlusion risk. Our result should be  confirmed with further large sample sized studies.
