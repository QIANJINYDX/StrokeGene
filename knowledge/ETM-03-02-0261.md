Abstract.  The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily  includes at least 57 genes that encode enzymes with diverse  metabolic and bio synthetic functions. This study was conducted  in order to investigate the associations between polymorphisms  in CYP superfamily genes ( CYP11B2 ,  CYP17A1 ,  CYP2B6 ,  CYP2C9 ,  CYP2E1  and  CYP7A1 ) and ischemic stroke (IS). Six  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP superfamily  genes were selected and genotyped by direct sequencing in  121 patients with IS and 321 control subjects. The genetic data  were analyzed using SNPStats and SPSS 18.0. Multiple logistic  regression models (codominant 1, codominant 2, dominant,  recessive and log-additive) were used to evaluate odds ratios  (ORs),   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. The  rs179998 SNP of  CYP11B2  was significantly associated with  IS   $\mathrm{{p}{=}0.0336}$   in a log-additive model). The rs3813867 SNP  of   $C Y P2E I$   was significantly associated with smoking in IS   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.0336$   in a log-additive model). The rs1799998 SNP of  CYP11B2  and rs3808607 of  CYP7A1  were related to diabetes  mellitus in IS   $\scriptstyle(\mathtt{p}<0.05)$  .  CYP11B2 ,  CYP2E1  and  CYP7A1  SNPs  were associated with IS in the population studied. Further study  is required to confirm these associations and to determine their  biological significance.  

# Introduction  

Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality and disability  in Western countries and a major health problem worldwide.  Almost 800,000 strokes occur annually in the United States,   $80\%$   of which are ischemic (1). Ischemic stroke (IS) results  from the abrupt interruption of focal cerebral blood flow (2).  The causes of IS include an embolic or thrombotic occlusion  or a decrease in cerebral blood flow resulting from the abrupt  occlusion of arteries and arterioles, poor blood circulation,  arteritis, venous occlusion, anemia or hyper viscosity (2-5).  Potent independent risk factors for IS include abdominal  obesity and body mass index (BMI) (6,7). Insulin resistance,  as indicated by elevated waist-to-hip ratios and insulin levels,  may also contribute to IS risk (8). A decrease in blood pressure  during the acute phase of IS is associated with brain injury and  poor stroke outcome (9). A low level of high-density lipoprotein  (HDL) cholesterol is a risk factor for mortality from coronary  artery disease and stroke in advanced age (10). Spousal smoking  may also be a significant risk factor for IS (11).  

The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily comprises  57 genes and these code for enzymes with diverse metabolic  and bio synthetic activities. Mutations in  $C Y P$   genes may cause  inborn errors of metabolism and contribute to clinically defined  conditions (12). The  CYP11B2  genotype significantly affects  the risk of hypertension in association with alcohol consump­ tion (13), and also interacts with BMI and waist circumference  in the Chinese Mongolian population (14). Variants of  CYP17A1   contribute to variations in blood pressure and hypertension  risk (15), and the  CYP17A1 - CNNM2 - NT5C2  region is associ­ ated with hypertension (16). Genetic variants of  CYP2B6  may  be related to the pathogen es is of leukemia (17) and to the  metabolism of nicotine and cotinine (18). Polymorphisms of  CYP2C9  can effect the risk of bleeding complications (19) and  the response to the anti hypertensive effects of losartan (20).  Polymorphisms of  CYP2E1,  together with cumulative smoking  and alcohol consumption, and polymorphisms of  NQO1  and   $A L D H2$   have been synergistic ally associated with lung cancer  in Koreans (21). Polymorphisms of   $C Y P7A I$   have been associ­ ated with baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL  cholesterol levels and risk of coronary artery disease (22).  

Recent studies have shown the relationships between genetic  polymorphisms and IS. The P213S polymorphism in L-selectin  and levels of the gene product sL-selectin have been associated  with IS in a Chinese population (23), polymorphisms in AdipoQ  in a Korean population (24), and variants of the a dip one ct in gene  in a Han population (25). Increased PAI-1 levels in plasma (26),  as well as the  ACE  (DD) genotype and D allele, significantly  increase susceptibility to IS (27). A significantly increased  risk of adverse cardiovascular events has been associated with  polymorphisms of CYP2C19 (28), and the V433M variant of  CYP4F2 has been associated with IS in Swedish males, beyond  its effect on blood pressure (29).  

In this study, we focused on the associations of single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the   $C Y P$   superfamily  genes,  CYP11B2 ,  CYP17A1 ,  CYP2B6 ,  CYP2C9 ,  CYP2E1  and  CYP7A1,  with IS, and with smoking and diabetes mellitus  (known risk factors for stroke) in IS. The aim of this study was  to clarify the relationship between   $C Y P$   polymorphisms and IS.  

# Materials and methods  

Subjects and clinical phenotypes.  Patients with IS who visited  the Stroke Center of the East-West Neo-Medical Center  between October 2007 and December 2010 were enrolled in  this study. A total of 121 IS patients (64 male/56 female) were  recruited. Patients with trauma, vascular malformations, brain  tumors and congenital brain disorders were excluded. Each  patient was diagnosed using cranial computed tomography  (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography or  duplex sonography. Stroke patients were classified by two  physicians with specialized knowledge of stroke into clinical  phenotypes based on the results of the National Institutes of  Health Stroke Survey (NIHSS), the Modified Barthel Index  (MBI) and the presence or absence of complex regional pain  syndrome (CRPS). Neurological deficit on admission was  measured using the NIHSS. The outcome at hospital discharge  was assessed using the MBI. The control subjects   $\mathrm{(n{=}321}$  ,  176 male/145 female) were selected from participants in a  general health check-up program. Participants with transient  ischemic attack, ischemic heart diseases and any other severe  diseases were excluded. The Ethics Review Committee of the  Medical Research Institute, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee  University (Korea) approved the protocol for this study and all  subjects gave written informed consent.  

SNP selection and genotyping.  We searched the SNP data­ base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP, build 131) for promoter  SNPs in the  CYP  superfamily genes. SNPs with unknown  he ter oz y gos it y, minor allele frequency (MAF) below   $10\%$   and  mono m orphic genotypes in Asians were excluded. We selected  the following six promoter-region SNPs:  CYP11B2 , rs1799998,  -344;  CYP17A1 , rs2486758, -190;  CYP2B6 , rs4802100, -1180;  CYP2C9 , rs4918758, -1163;  CYP2E1 , rs3813867, -1272;  CYP7A1 ,  rs3808607, -278. Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole  blood of each subject using the High Pure PCR Template  Preparation kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to  the manufacturer's instructions. Blood samples collected from  each subject were stored at   $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Genotypes were determined  by direct sequencing. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were  performed with the following primers (Table I). The PCR prod­ ucts were sequenced using the ABI PRISM 3730XL analyzer  (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and sequence  data were analyzed using SeqManII software (DNASTAR Inc.,  Madison, WI, USA).  

Statistical analysis.  SNPStats (http://bioinfo.icon co logia. net/index.php?module  $:=$  Snpstats) and SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc.,  Chicago, IL, USA) were used to analyze the genetic data.  Hardy-Weinberg equilibria (HWE) were calculated using  the Chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression analyses  (codominant 1, codominant 2, dominant, recessive and logadditive) were performed to determine odds ratios (ORs), 
  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) and   $\mathrm{p}$  -values. For multiple  comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was performed by  multiplying the p-value by the number of SNPs analyzed   $\mathrm{(n{=}6)}$  ).  The significance level was set at  $\mathrm{p{<}0.05}$  .  

# Results  

The clinical characteristics of IS patients and control subjects  are shown in Table II. The mean ages of patients with IS and  control subjects were   $64.6{\pm}13.1$   [mean  $\pm$  standard deviation,  (SD)] and   $59.1{\pm}11.9\$   years, respectively. Patients were divided  into subgroups according to NIHSS scores for neurological  deficit on admission (  ${\langle}6$   and  ${>}6$  ), MBI scores for outcome at  discharge (  ${\mathord{<}}60$   and  ${>}60$  ), CRPS (present and absent), smoking,  hypertension, diabetes and dys lipid emi a (30).  

The genotype frequencies of the six selected SNPs are shown  in Table III. An association was found between rs1799998, a  SNP of  CYP11B2 , and IS. Multiple logistic regression analysis  was performed for the promoter SNP (rs1799998, -344, T/C)  [codominant 1, T/T (reference) vs. T/C; codominant 2, T/T vs.  C/C; dominant, T/T vs.  $\mathrm{T/C+C/C}$  ; recessive,   $\mathrm{T/T+T/C}$   vs. C/C;  and log-additive, T/T vs. T/C vs. C/C]. The parameters for the  association of SNP rs1799998 with IS are shown in Table III  [  $(\mathrm{p{=}0.018}$  ; OR, 0.29;   $95\%$   CI, 0.11-0.81 in the codominant 2  model),   $\tt(p{=}0.0220$  ; OR, 0.60;   $95\%$   CI, 0.39-0.93 in the domi­ nant model),   $\mathrm{(p{=}0.023\$  ; OR, 0.35;   $95\%$   CI, 0.13-0.95 in the  recessive model) and   $(\mathrm{p}{=}0.0056$  ; OR, 0.61;   $95\%$   CI, 0.43‑0.87  in the log-additive model)]. In allele distribution analysis,  the frequency of the rs1799998 C allele was lower in the IS  group than in the control group (C allele frequency, 32.0 vs.   $23.5\%$ ,  $\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.015$ ; OR, 0.65;  $95\%$  CI, 0.46‑0.92; data not shown). Following Bonferroni correction, the association was also  significant (  $\mathtt{\tilde{p}=}0.0336$  ; Table III).  

We analyzed the genetic data in order to evaluate the inter­ actions of traditional IS risk factors (smoking, hypertension,  diabetes and dys lipid emi a) with the association between IS  and polymorphisms of the CYP superfamily genes ( CYP11B2 ,  CYP17A1 ,  CYP2B6 ,  CYP2C9 ,  CYP2E1  and  CYP7A1 ). When  we assessed the genetic relationships between CYP promoter  SNPs and IS risk by smoking status,  CYP11B2  (rs1799998)  and  CYP2E1  (rs3813867) differed between smoking (-)  and smoking   $(+)$   [(rs1799998:  $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{p}=0.022}$  ; OR, 14.00;   $95\%$   CI,  1.03‑190.90 in the recessive model), (rs3813867:   $\tt p{=}0.019$  ;  OR, 0.28;   $95\%$   CI, 0.09-0.87 in the dominant model) and   $\mathrm{\varphi{p}{=}0.0056}$  ; OR, 0.30;   $95\%$   CI, 0.11-0.79 in the log-additive  model) Table IV]. Following Bonferroni correction, the asso­ ciation of rs3813867 of  CYP2E1  was significant (  $\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.0336$  ;  Table IV). In allele distribution analysis, the frequency of the  rs3813867 C allele of  CYP2E1  was lower in the smoking (-)  than in the smoking   $(+)$   group (C allele frequency, 25.6 vs.   $8.6\%$  ;  $\tt p{=}0.010$  ; OR, 0.28;  $95\%$   CI, 0.10-0.73; data not shown).  The SNPs rs1799998 of  CYP11B2  and rs3808607 of  CYP7A1 were associated with diabetes mellitus in IS [rs1799998:   $(\mathrm{p{=}0.002}$  ; OR, 3.65;   $95\%$   CI, 1.59-8.41 in the codominant 1  model),   $(\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.0011$  ; OR, 3.77;   $95\%$   CI, 1.66-8.56 in the domi­ nant model) and   $\tt(p{=}0.0014$  ; OR, 3.10;   $95\%$   CI, 1.51-6.38 in  the log-additive model)] and [rs3808607:   $\mathrm{{(p{=}0.047}}$  ; OR, 0.41;   $95\%$   CI, 0.17-0.99 in the codominant 1 model),   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.013$  ; OR,  0.23;  $95\%$   CI, 0.07‑0.73 in the codominant 2 model),   $\mathrm{(p{=}0.011\$  ;

Following Bonferroni correction, the associations of  the rs1799998 SNP of  CYP11B2  and rs3813867 of  CYP2E1 were significant (  $\tt(p{<}0.05\$  ; Table  V). In allele distribution  analysis, the C allele of rs1799998 of  CYP11B2  and the G allele  of rs3808607 of  CYP7A1  were also associated with diabetes  mellitus [(rs1799998 of  CYP11B2 :  $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{p}=0.002}$  ; OR, 2.59,   $95\%$   CI,

We used the online program AliBaba2.1 (www.gene‑regu­ lation.com/pub/programs/alibaba2) to evaluate whether the  promoter SNPs affect transcription factor binding at the  promoter site. The results are shown in Table VI.  

# Discussion  

The results of this study reveal that promoter SNPs of  CYP superfamily genes are associated with IS, and suggest that these  polymorphisms may effect the risk of IS in Koreans. Recently,  genetic studies of SNPs from  CYP11B2 ,  CYP17A1 ,  CYP2E1 and  CYP7A1  in several diseases have been reported. Tu  et al reported that the promoter SNP of  CYP11B2  (rs1799998, T/C,  -344) is associated with IS in both a dominant and a recessive  effect in meta-analyses, with a moderate overall effect in the  Han Chinese population (31). They suggest that the rs1799998  variant in  CYP11B2  affects susceptibility to stroke. In an  Indian population, significant associations were found between  the rs1799998 SNP of CYP11B2 and the risk of hypertension  and IS (32).  

The present study reveals an association between the  rs1799998, -344T/C SNP of  CYP11B2  and IS, which suggests  that this SNP may effect susceptibility to IS. The C/C  genotype and C allele distributions of rs1799998 in IS (C/C  genotype,   $4.2\%$  ; C allele,   $23.5\%$  ) were approximately 2.3- and  1.4-fold lower than those in the controls (C/C genotype,   $9.7\%$  ;  C allele,   $32.0\%$  ), respectively. These results may indicate that  the C allele of rs1799998 has a protective effect on IS risk.  

In a Japanese population, the -344T/C polymorphism in  CYP11B2  was identified as an independent genetic factor associ­ ated with hypertension or at hero sclerotic disease (33). However,  we did not find such an association with hypertension in the  present study. Instead, we identified associations with smoking  and diabetes mellitus in IS. An association between -344T/C of  the  CYP11B2  gene and smoking was identified, but it was not  significant. The -1272G/C SNP of  CYP2E1  was significantly  associated with smoking and IS in the present study. CYP2E1  metabolizes endogenous substrates, including ethanol, acetone  and acetal, and exogenous substrates, including benzene, carbon  tetrachloride, ethylene glycol and nitro s amines, which are

pre mutagens found in cigarette smoke. Through its numerous  substrates, CYP2E1 may be involved in such diverse processes,  such as g luc one o genesis, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes and cancer  [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), 124040].  Howard  et al  suggested that CYP2E1 induction in the brain, by  ethanol or nicotine, may influence the central effects of ethanol  and the development of nervous tissue path o logie s observed  in alcoholics and smokers (34). The -344T/C of  CYP11B2  and  -278T/G of   $C Y P7A I$   were associated with diabetes mellitus in  IS. Bellili  et al  found associations of the -344T/C and the 3097   $\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   polymorphisms of  CYP11B2  with hypertension, type 2  diabetes and metabolic syndrome in a French population (35).  Russo  et al  reported that the C allele of the -344T/C variant  of  CYP11B2  increases susceptibility to metabolic syndrome in  European males, but not in females (36). Aldo ster one is one of  the main effectors of the renin-angiotensin-aldo ster one system,  regulating blood pressure. Previous studies have shown that the  aldo ster one synthase promoter polymorphism, -344T/C, affects  aldo ster one levels and is associated with hypertension, a risk  factor for the initiation and progression of diabetic ne phr opa thy.  The -344T/C of  CYP11B2  may also effect glucose homeostasis  and body mass in humans (36,37). CYP7A1 is a rate-limiting  enzyme for cholesterol catabolism and bile acid synthesis, and  may thereby effect cholesterol homeostasis. The -278T/G of   $C Y P7A I$   is associated with sub clinical atherosclerosis, LDL  cholesterol level and gallstone disease.  

In conclusion, this study, carried out in a Korean population,  reveals that variations in the  CYP11B2 ,  CYP2E1  and  CYP7A1   genes are associated with IS and may represent genetic risk  factors in IS. Larger studies are required to confirm these  associations and to evaluate their causal roles in IS.
