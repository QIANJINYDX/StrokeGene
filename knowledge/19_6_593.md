# Association Study Between C-Reactive Protein Genes and Ischemic Stroke in Japanese Subjects  

Akihiko Morita, Tomohiro Nakayama, and Masayoshi Soma Background:  C-reactive protein (CRP) is reported to be involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Elevated CRP levels are considered to be a predictor of ischemic stroke (IS) in elderly individuals. Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are reportedly associated with elevated CRP levels. The aims of this study were to genotype some of the SNP in the human CRP gene and to assess the association between the CRP gene and IS.  

Methods:  Japanese patients with IS   $72.4\pm\:8.2$   years of age,  $n\,=\,152$  ) and elderly Japanese subjects without IS   $78.0\,\pm\,4.2$   years of age,  $n\,=\,304$  ) were genotyped for four SNP of the human CRP gene: rs1341665, rs1800947, rs1130864, and rs1205. Each genotyping was performed using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The haplotype-based association study was assessed with a permutation test.  

I schemic cerebro vascular disease is known to be a multi factorial disorder. Various factors such as aging, hypertension,   diabetes mellitus,   hyperlipidemia,   low levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein,   and smoking 5   are reportedly established risk factors. Atherosclerosis is one of the major causes of ischemic stroke (IS) and is considered to be an in amma tory disease.   C-reactive protein (CRP), widely known to be an in amma tory marker, was detected in at hero sclerotic plaques,   and was recently reported to be involved in the development of atherosclerosis.   Elevated plasma CRP levels may be an a the roth rom bot ic biomarker that provides additive prognostic information about not only coronary heart disease 9 but also peripheral arterial disease, along with standard lipid measures.   Moreover elevated plasma CRP levels Results:  The genotype rs1800947 was statistically signiﬁcant between patients with IS and control subjects  $(\mathbf{CC}+\mathbf{GC}$   versus GG variant,  $P=.016$   by multiple logistic regression analysis). This analysis revealed that the  $_\mathrm{CC+GC}$   variant of rs1800947 was an independent risk factor of IS. All four SNP were located in one haplotype block. The haplotype was constructed using rs1341665, rs1800947, and rs1130864, in that order. There was a signiﬁcant association between IS and the C-C-C haplotype   $(P\,=\,.015)$  ).  

Conclusions:  The rs1800947 SNP and the C-C-C haplotype in the CRP gene appear to be prognostic markers of ischemic stroke and this polymorphism could be a useful genetic marker. Am J Hypertens 2006;19:  $593–600\circledcirc\zeta$  2006 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

could be a marker that predicts the risk of IS in the elderly.  

The human CRP gene is located on chromosome 1q21 to 1q23, spanning approximately   $1.9\ \mathrm{k\mathbf{b}}$   and containing two exons. In the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP ), 29 SNP were recorded (accessed October 20, 2004). Nonsense mutations in the coding region were not recorded and there was one silent mutation named rs1800947.   The SNP rs1130864 was reported to be associated with elevated basal CRP levels, whereas some SNP (ie, rs1205 and rs1800947) were reportedly associated with reduced levels.   The SNP rs2794521 has been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.   The SNP rs1205 has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and anti nuclear auto antibody production.   The SNP rs1130864 has been associated with coronary heart disease requiring surgical treatment with an artery bypass graft.   However there have been no reports assessing the relationship between the variants of the CRP gene and IS.  

The aims of this study were to genotype some of the SNP in the human CRP gene in Japanese subjects and to assess the association between the CRP gene and IS.  

# Subjects and Methods Subjects  

The participants in whom IS was diagnosed were recruited at Nihon University Itabashi Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, and the other neighboring hospitals during a decade (1993 to 2003). We selected 152 patients with IS diagnosed by neurologic examination and the ﬁndings of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or both, and who had neurologic deﬁcit ratings greater than grade 3 on the modiﬁed Rankin Scale.   Patients with hemorrhage stroke diagnosed by CT or MRI or both were excluded in this study group. Patient age ranged from 60 to 99 years (mean  $\pm$   standard deviation [SD],  $72.4\,\pm\,8.2$  years). Japanese subjects   $(n~=~304)$   were enrolled as control subjects. Control subject age ranged from 66 to 94 years (mean  $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$  ,   $78.0\,\pm\,4.2$   years). Because the mean age of the control group was older than that of the IS group, the control group was regarded as a super–control group.   They were members of the New Elder Citizen Movement in Japan who lived in Tokyo and the suburbs of Tokyo and who had vascular risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes mellitus but no history of IS. They were conﬁrmed as having grade 0 on the modiﬁed Rankin Scale. In this study group, participants with cancer or autoimmune disease, including antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, were excluded. The number of participants with a history of atrial brillat ion was 14 in the IS group. Patients with cerebral embolism caused by atrial brillat ion, diagnosed by anamnesis and the ﬁndings of electrocardiograph y, echo car dio graph y, CT, or MRI were excluded. However patients in whom cerebral thrombosis was diagnosed were included. No participant had a history of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Informed consent was obtained from each subject according to a protocol approved by the Human Studies Committee of Nihon University.  

# Genotyping  

According to the information on the NCBI SNP data- base or the Applied Biosystems–Celera Discovery System (ABI-CDS, http://www.applied bio systems.com ) database, the SNP that had a minor allele frequency  ${>}18\%$   or those established by previous articles were chosen. We selected four SNP in the human CRP gene for determination of the genetic association between patients with IS and control subjects. In the present experiment, four SNP were named SNP1 to SNP4 in order of their position from the  $5^{\prime}$  end of this gene. The SNP named SNP1, located in the 5 =  ﬂanking region, was rs1341665. SNP2, located in the intron 2 region, was

rs1800947. SNP3, also known as rs1130864, and SNP4, also known as rs1205, were located in the  $3^{\prime}$   untranslated region of the gene ( Fig. 1 ).  

Blood samples were collected from all participants, and genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes by extraction with phenol and chloroform.  

Each genotyping, except that of rs1205, was performed using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay, which was commercially supplied by Applied Biosystems Inc. (ABI, Foster City, CA). SNP rs1205 was genotyped by using a Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay, which was also commercially supplied by ABI.  

The TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays were applied using the method of  Taq  amp li cation. In the  $5^{\prime}$   nuclease assay, discrimination occurs during the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) because of allele-speciﬁc ﬂuorogenic probes that, when hybridized to the template, are cleaved by the  $5^{\prime}$   n lease activity of  Taq  polymerase. The probes contain a 3 =  minor groove-binding group (MGB) that hybridizes to single-stranded targets with increased sequence-speciﬁcity compared with ordinary DNA probes. This reduces nonspeciﬁc probe hybridization and results in low background u or esc en ce during the   $5^{\prime}$   nuclease PCR assay (TaqMan, ABI). Cleavage results in the increased emission of a reporter dye. Each  $5^{\prime}$   nuclease assay requires two unlabeled PCR primers and two allele-speciﬁc probes. Each probe was dually labeled with reporter dyes at the  $5^{\prime}$  end; in this study VIC and FAM were used as the reporter dyes. The primers and probes in the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (ABI) were chosen from the information on the ABI web site ( http://myscience.applied bio systems.com ).  

Polymerase chain reaction amp li cation was accomplished by using  $6~\mu\mathrm{L}$   of TaqMan Universal Master Mix, No AmpErase UNG   $(2\times)$   (ABI) in   $12\ \mu\mathrm{L}$   ﬁnal reaction volumes, with 2 ng DNA,  $0.22\,\mu\mathrm{L}$   TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay Mix (  $20\times$   or   $40\times$  ) containing  $900\ \mathrm{nm}/\mathrm{L}$   primers, and  $200\;\mathrm{nm}/\mathrm{L}$   ﬁnal concentrations of the probes. Thermal cycling conditions were   $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $2~\mathrm{min}$  ,  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\ \mathrm{min}$  , and then 40 cycles of  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $15~\mathrm{sec}$   and  $62^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $1\ \mathrm{min}$  . Thermal cycling was performed on GeneAmp 9700 systems.  

Each 96-well plate contained 80 samples of an unknown genotype and four reactions with reagents but no DNA (control). The control samples without DNA were necessary for the Sequence Detection System (SDS) 7700 signal processing as outlined in the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Guide (ABI). These plates were read on the SDS 7700 instrument with the end-point analysis mode of the SDS version 1.6.3 software package (ABI). Genotypes were determined visually based on the dyecomponent ﬂuorescent emission data depicted in the X-Y scatter plot of the SDS software. Genotypes were also determined automatically by the signal processing algorithms in the software. Results of each scoring method were saved in two separate output ﬁles for later comparison.  

# Biochemical Analysis  

The plasma concentration of total cholesterol and the serum concentration of creatinine were measured by standard methods in the Clinical Laboratory Department of Nihon University Hospital.  

# Statistical Analysis  

All continuous variables were expressed as mean  $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$  . Continuous variables of IS patients and control subjects were assessed with Mann-Whitney    $U$   test. Categorical variables were assessed with the Fisher’s exact test. Genotypes were classiﬁed into three distinct groups: additive, dominant, and recessive. The distribution of the additive, dominant, and recessive models of genotypes was examined with Fisher’s exact test. The contingency table including 0 was not examined. In addition, multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the contribution of con founders (history of hypertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a, ischemic heart disease, and atrial ﬁbrillation). Based on the genotype data of the genetic variations, linkage d is equilibrium (LD) analysis, and a haplotype-based case-control study were performed using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm,   with the SNPAlyze software program, version 3.2 (Dynacom Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan). The pairwise LD analysis of this study was performed using four SNP pairs. The  $\mathbf{D}^{\prime}$   values  ${\tt>}0.5$   were used to assign SNP locations to one haplotype block. Tagged SNP were selected by omitting one SNP from a SNP pair showing    $r^{2}\mathrm{~}_{>0.5}$   for each haplotype block. In this haplotype-based case control study, haplotypes with a frequency    ${<}0.02$   were excluded. The frequency distribution of the haplotypes was calculated by a permutation test using the bootstrap method. Statistical sign i can ce was established at  $P<.05$  . Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows, version 12 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).  

# Results  

We genotyped four SNP in 152 patients with IS and 304 control subjects.  Table 1  shows the clinical features of the two study populations. The mean age was sign i cant ly higher in the control group than in the IS group. body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate were sign i cant ly higher in the patient group, except for the body mass index and diastolic blood pressure in women. Serum creatinine was sign i cant ly higher in the IS group. However there was no sign i can ce between men and women in the two groups. Plasma concentration of total cholesterol was sign i cant ly higher in the control group. Incidence of of hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and atrial brillat ion were significantly higher in the IS group. Incidence of hyper lipid emi a was sign i cant ly higher in the control group, except in the male control subjects. Alcohol consumption was signiﬁ-

Table 2  shows the distribution of the genotypes of the four SNP. The genotype distribution of each SNP did not show signiﬁcant differences from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium values (data not shown). The Fisher’s exact test showed that the distribution in the dominant model of SNP1   $(\mathbf{CC}+\mathbf{CT}$   versus TT) was sign i cant ly different between the two groups   $(P\,=\,.047)$  ). However this distribution did not show a signiﬁcant difference by multiple logistic regression analysis   $(P~=~.188$  ;   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval [CI], 0.73 to 5.0).  

On the other hand, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the distribution in the recessive model of SNP2 (GG versus  $\mathbf{CC}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{GC})$  ) was statistically signiﬁcant  $\textstyle P=.016$  ;  $95\%$   CI, 1.3 to 10.9) ( Table 2 ).

Patterns of linkage d is equilibrium in the CRP gene are shown with their  $\mathrm{D^{\prime}}$   and  $r^{2}$    values ( Table 4 ).   SNP were located in one haplotype block. Because the  $r^{2}$    of SNP1- SNP4 was large, we constructed the haplotype-based association study using SNP1, SNP2, and SNP3. Four possible haplotypes were predicted and each had a frequency  ${\tt>}0.02$   ( Table 5 ). The overall distribution of these haplotypes was statistically signiﬁcant   $(\chi^{2}{=}~24.7$  , permutation    $P\;=\;.046)$  ). In the H3 haplotype (C-C-C), statistical sign i can ce was shown   $(\chi^{2}{=}~23.4$  , permutation  $P=.015)$  ).  

# Discussion  

Atherosclerosis, one of the major causes of IS, is considered to involve the in amma tory system.   C-reactive protein, a major in amma tory marker, has been detected in at hero sclerotic plaques 7   and may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis.   An elevated plasma CRP level may be an a the roth rom bot ic biomarker that provides additive prognostic information about not only coronary heart disease 9   but also peripheral arterial disease.   Moreover an elevated plasma CRP level could be a marker that predicts the risk of IS in elderly individuals.  

Some SNP in the human CRP gene were reported to be associated with elevated basal CRP levels, while some were associated with reduced levels.   Case control studies have shown that some SNP are associated with coronary heart disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus. However the basal CRP level was easily elevated with an in amma tory stimulus such as bacterial infection, other in amma tory disease, malignancy, and necrosis. In fact patients with IS may have had complications such as pneumonia and deep venous thrombosis that made the basal CRP level difﬁcult to assess. Thus we examined the SNP that were already known to be associated with variable basal CRP level.  

In the present study, we genotyped four SNP of the CRP gene in Japanese subjects and assessed the association between this gene and IS. In this association study, we used a super-control group, consistent with aged and unaffected subjects. Healthy elderly subjects are more suitable than young or middle-aged subjects for the determination of phenotypes of cardiovascular and cerebro vascular diseases related to aging, because many such diseases occur late in life. Ischemic stroke is an age-inﬂuenced disease; therefore it was better to use the super–control group than the age-matched control group. In this study, the level of total cholesterol and the number of subjects with hyper lipid emi a were signiﬁcantly higher in the control group, especially in women. In the control group, many subjects had diagnosed hyper lipid emi a and were treated with diet therapy without anti hyper lip emi c drugs.

 $\mathbf{I}\mathsf{S}=$   ischemic stroke;  $\mathsf{M j}=$   major allele;  $\mathsf{M n\,=}$   minor allele. Mj and Mn indicate haplotypes with major and minor frequencies, respectively. Haplotypes with frequencies  $\mathord{>}0.02$   were estimated using SNPAlyze software.  $^*P$   value was calculated by permutation test using bootstrap method. Overall distribution of these haplotypes was statistically significant  $(\chi^{2}=24.7$  ,  $P=.046)$  );  $\dag{\cal P}<.05$  .  

The multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted by the con founders hypertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a, ischemic heart disease, and atrial brillat ion showed signiﬁcant differences in the distribution of the recessive model (GG versus  $\mathbf{CC}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{GC})$   of SNP2. The result indicated that the risk of IS could be increased in subjects with the C allele of SNP2.  

In general, high CRP levels reportedly promoted a pro at hero sclerotic and pro in amma tory phenotype. The relationship between high CRP levels and the progression of atherosclerosis has been well documented. Although the SNP2 had no function because of its location in the intron, the SNP was reported to be associated with reduced basal CRP levels. However there was no association between SNP2 and the risk of arterial thrombosis.   It has been described that in coronary artery bypass graft patients, stimulated CRP levels were found in patients with the TT genotype of SNP3. However the genotype of SNP3 did not inﬂuence the basal CRP level.   It was considered that the stimulated CRP level could be another predictor of atherosclerosis in addition to the high basal CRP level. Ischemic stroke is a multi factorial disorder and this SNP was only one of its risk predictors. The genetic and environmental factors each importantly contributed to the vascular risk associated with in amma tion. The association between a high stimulated CRP level and IS has not yet been reported and may be a subject for future study. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, hyper lipid emi a was evaluated as a protective factor of IS. Hypertension and diabetes were described to be strong risk factors of IS.   However hyper cho lesteremia was not an established risk factor of IS in the Japanese population.   Moreover in the present study, many control subjects, especially women, had hyperlipidemia that might inﬂuence other con founders.  

The distribution of the dominant genotypes of SNP1 was statically signiﬁcant between the IS patients and control subjects in the Fisher’s exact test. However in the multiple logistic regression analysis, there was no statistical sign i can ce. The con founders might affect the significant difference of SNP1. This SNP is located in the  $5^{\prime}$  ﬂanking region. Nevertheless this SNP is unlikely to inﬂuence transcriptional activity because it is far from the transcriptional initiation site, at approximately 7200 nucleotides.  

The genotype SNP3 was reportedly associated with an elevated CRP level   and the genotype SNP4 was reportedly associated with SLE and anti nuclear autoantibody production.   In the present study, none of the participants had a history of collagen diseases including SLE. Anti–phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), which is often complicated with SLE, was known to be a major risk factor for IS and related to the progression of atherosclerosis and the pathogen es is of thrombosis. A signiﬁcant positive correlation was found between the presence of anti car dio lip in antibody, one of the an tip hos ph olipid antibodies, and an elevated CRP level.   However in the present study there was no statistical sign i can ce by the the Fisher’s exact test and the multiple logistic regression analysis.  

In genes with multiple susceptibility alleles, a haplotype-based association study could have advantages over analysis based on individual SNP, particularly when LD between SNP was weak.   In the present study, haplotypes were constructed using three SNP (SNP1, SNP2, and SNP3), based on results of LD analysis and a statistical sign i can ce was shown in the H3 haplotype (C-C-C). An association study using each SNP showed that the  $\mathbf{CC}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{GC}$   variant of SNP2 could be a predictor of IS. This result was consistent with the result of a haplotype-based association study. The frequency of the H3 haplotype (C-C-C) was found in only  $4\%$   of the IS group. However this was no surprise given the low frequency of the susceptibility haplotype because IS is thought to be a multi factorial disorder.  

In conclusion, the SNP2 and the H3 haplotype (C-C-C) of the CRP gene are genetic markers for IS. Further studies are needed to clarify the causal and susceptibility mutation of IS in the CRP gene or neighboring genes.
