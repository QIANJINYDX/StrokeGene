# Abstract  

Up to date, series of studies on ischemic stroke had resulted in inconsistent conclusion. In this study, we aimed to evaluate which speciﬁc genes were associated with increased predisposition to stroke in a Chinese population. To identify the speciﬁc genes and polymorphisms associated with predisposition to ischemic stroke, we performed high throughput sequenom based next-generation sequencing from 743 patient with history of ischemic stroke. Variants SNPs in nNOS, renalase, MTHFR,

# Introduction  

Population studies involving genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of complex disorders. For the cardiovascular system studies, speciﬁc polymorphisms have been linked to variations of QT interval (1), hypertension (2–4) and predisposition to myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes (5–8)  

CELSR1 and XYLB genes were found sign i cant ly associated with IS, thus suggesting involvement of these loci to IS in Chinese patients. Because of different locations on chromosomes, haplotype analyses were not feasible. Our results demonstrate the top level genes that are related to normal vascular physiology, viz. genes of nitric oxide synthesis, endo the li al health and smooth muscle biology. Further validation studies are awaited.  $\copyright$   2015 IUBMB Life, 67(3):170–174, 2015  

and venous occlusion (9–11). For example, myocardial infarction predominantly results from intra vascular thrombosis; studies have been extended to evaluate relationships of SNPs with predisposition to ischemic stroke (12–24). SNPs have also been associated with cerebro vascular architectural defects including aneurysm and vessel dissection (25–27). As ischemic stroke is presenting feature of a number of single-gene disorders as well, the population studies could provide a better way to give insights of IS.  

Epidemiologic studies have provided insights into mechanistic factors contributing to stroke in population derived from Northwest China (28). In this retrospective study, 489 patients with ischemic stroke were evaluated for association. The clinical outcomes in this study was evaluated by using the modiﬁed Rankin scale (mRS) and grouped as good (score 0–2) or poor (score 3–6) outcomes. Regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of ischemic stroke. After 47 months of follow-up, 244   $(56.2\%)$  ) patients had favorable outcome and 190   $(43.8\%)$   had negative results. The poor outcome was observed more with elderly patients (OR: 3.505; CI   $95\%$  :

 2.100–5.849), had intriguing association with educational level

 (OR: 0.686; CI  $95\%$  : 0.570–0.825), with previous history of CVA (OR: 2.481; CI  $95\%$  : 1.442–4.268), and higher raised total score

 (OR: 2.619; CI  $95\%$  : 1.584–4.330).  

Other studies have linked various gene polymorphisms to predisposition to stroke. For example, certain clades with polymorphism in HDAC 9 gene have linked to stroke in a Han Chinese population (29). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) investigating ischemic stroke (IS) in Caucasian or African population and Japanese have reported inconsistent conclusions (29). Susceptibility loci for IS by exome sequencing in a Chinese Han population was evaluated. In the initial exome sequencing analysis, rs10489177 in c1orf156 gene located on chromosome 1q24   $(P\!<\!1\,\times\,10^{-8})$  ) and rs17118 in XYLB gene located on chromosome 3p21   $(P\!<\!1\,\times\,10^{-6})$   were discovered to be positively correlated with IS (29). Besides these genes reported, predisposition to stroke has also been associated with polymorphisms in angiotensin converting enzyme gene. Especially, a 290 base pair insertion deletion type of polymorphism in intron16 has been linked to stroke risk in Chinese population as well as numerous ethnic regions (12).  

At present, ﬁndings on the relationship between genetic susce pti bil it y to stroke are not perfect, and there are many contradictory ﬁndings. In this study, we wanted to evaluate which speciﬁc genes were associated with increased predisposition to stroke in a Chinese population. To achieve this end, we performed high throughput sequenom based next-generation sequencing to identify speciﬁc genes and related polymorphism that showed a trend towards predisposition to ischemic stroke. We present a rank order list of top ﬁfteen genes under consideration.

# Ethics Statement  

This study’s protocol was performed according to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Committee of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University. All participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.  

# Patient Populations, Samples and DNA Elution  

DNA of 743 patient samples with history of ischemic stroke were used from this study. Power calculation is not included as this was a pilot preliminary study.

# Results  

# Rank Order List of Top Eight Genes Associated with Ischemic Stroke  

A total of 5,761 SNPs were detected, and the top genes that were associated with the 15 detected SNPs in patient blood samples of ischemic stroke, were represented in a network of only eight genes, viz, nNOS, HDAC9, ApoE, ApoE2, CELSR1, MTHFR, XYLB and renalase. Follow the data rank method, the genes and their detection rate are indicated in Table 1. In the single allelic analysis, tests for associations between ischemic stroke and the SNPs revealed these eight variants, which persisted after multiple comparisons.

Speciﬁc functions reported of the selected genes are shown in Table 2. The raw datasets of the signals and the nucleotide variance of different patient samples are presented as Supporting Information ﬁles 1 and 2. Each of these genes was derived on dbSNP and their MAF scores estimated. Allele frequency database (ALFRED, http://alfred.med.yale.edu/alfred/ recordinfo.asp?condition  $\mathbf{\xi}.\overline{{\overline{{\mathbf{\xi}}}}}$  sites.site_uid  $=$  %27SI208734Y) was used for cross-examining results with dbSNP.  

# Discussion  

The main objective of this study was to identify correlative susce pti bil it y SNPs for ischemic stroke (IS) in Chinese, to acheive this, pooled genetic SNP data from GWAS was performed in 753 patient samples. Variants in nNOS, renalase, MTHFR, CELSR1 and XYLB genes were found sign i cant ly associated with IS through high through-put sequencing, the multiple loci involved association suggesting ischemic stroke also presenting feature of multiple genes disorders in Chinese patients. Because of different SNPs’ locations on chromosomes, haplotype analyses were not feasible. Our results demonstrate the top level genes that are related to normal vascular physiology, viz. genes of nitric oxide synthesis, endo the li al health and smooth muscle biology (30–42).  

We found renalase has comparative high relationship with IS; this gene encodes a novel ﬂavin adenine dinucleotidedependent amine oxidase (35–38). This enzyme is secreted by the kidney and functions to catabolize circulating catecholamines, thus having a direct effect on cardiac function and systemic blood pressure (BP). Renalase gene has been shown to harbor genetic variants associated with EH in the northern Han Chinese population. The C allele of rs2296545 SNP of renalase was associated with hypertension in diabetic patients  $(P<0.01)$   (35). For rs10887800 SNP, the differences in the G allele frequencies were seen in hypertensive patients with stroke, with   $66\%$   of patients presenting the GG homozygotes. SNPs of the renalase gene in 507 ischemic stroke patients and 503 gender-matched controls from a northern Chinese Han population revealed signiﬁcant associations. The recessive model demonstrated a strong correlation of rs2296545 with ischemic stroke patients in hypertension subgroups  $[0\mathrm{R}=1.927$  ,   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}=1.012–3.669$  ,  $P=0.046$  ). Therefore, the association of SNPs in renalase and IS provide an evidence that renalase is a key point in cerebral vascular physiology; further research on relanase would extend our understanding about its function and guide the prevention of IS.  

Various other genes like the epsilon-2 variant of ApoE have been shown to be a major risk factor for warfarininduced cerebral hemorrhage. In conclusion, our study reveals that a short cluster of genes that play a major role in cerebral vascular physiology may be associated with inherent susceptibility to poor BP regulation, increased intra vascular coagulation and predisposition to ischemic stroke. The conclusion of our study form a baseline, which may be conﬁrmed with detailed large sample sizes haplotype analyses. The association of SNPs and IS may help to enhance risk strat i cation with the aim to prevent ischemic stroke at an individualized patient basis.
