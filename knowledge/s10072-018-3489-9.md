# Abstract  

Previous studies have shown that CpG-SNPs might have influence on gene function via allele-specific DNA methyl ation (ASM). However, association study between DNA methyl ation and the promoter   $\mathrm{CpG{-}S N P s}$   in  ALOX5AP  gene with IS has not been reported. The present study aims to explore the relationship among CpG-SNPs, methyl ation levels, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of  $A L O X5A P$   gene. Firstly, we made a two-stage association study to identify a potential associated CpG-SNP

 (rs4073259) by SNaPshot genotyping approach (  $\scriptstyle P\,=\,0.015$  ,    $O R\,{=}\,0.672$  ,  $95\%$   CI  0.487 – 0.927;  $P\!=\!0.035$  ,    $O R\,{=}\,0.809$  ,   $95\%$   CI

  $0.664–0.985$  , respectively). In addition, the methyl ation levels of   $17\,\mathrm{CpG}$   sites located in the promoter of  ${}^{;}A L O X5A P$   were tested by Methyl Target sequencing. The methyl ation level of GG genotype carriers is significantly higher than those with the AG and AA genotypes   $(P\!<\!0.05)$  ). And the GG genotype carriers with higher DNA methyl ation levels have a decreased mRNA expression levels of  ALOX5AP  (  $\scriptstyle P\,<\,0.05)$  . Finally, we found that the G allele with higher methyl ation level has got a lower transcription activity than the A allele by luciferase assay (  $P\!=\!0.000$  ).The study provided evidence that IS-associated CpG-SNP rs4073259 may affect the expression level of  ALOX5AP  through allele-specific methyl ation and consequently the phenotype of the disease.

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex brain disease influenced by environmental and genetic factors, with an increasing incidence of morbidity, disability, and mortality in China [ 1 ,  2 ].

The genetic susceptibility of IS might mostly attribute to the genotypic variations [ 3 ,  4 ]. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have unearthed thousands of IS-associated DNA sequence variants in recent years. However, many of these variants were non-coding and their functional roles were much difficult to be identified [ 5 ]. Therefore, how to do the genetic association study of IS in the post-GWAS era faces enormous challenges.  

Epigenetics is based on the alteration of gene expression without changing gene sequence, providing a new perspective for the study of the pathogen es is of IS [ 6 ]. There existed studies elucidating that some epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methyl ation and histone modification were involved in the onset of cerebro vascular diseases [ 7 ,  8 ]. DNA methyl ation mainly takes place at the cytosine in a cytosine-phosphateguanine (CpG) dinucleotide in differentiated mammalian cells [ 9 ]. The higher DNA methyl ation levels of the gene promoter region usually result in the transcriptional silencing [ 10 ]. In addition, some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that located in CpG dinucleotide s might generate or abolish a CpG site, named CpG-SNPs. CpG-SNPs are considered to adjust the interaction of the genetic (SNP), and epigenetic (DNA methyl ation), which affect the underlying mechanisms of gene expression function [ 11 ].  

5-lip oxygen as e-activating protein, encoded by an IS independent risk gene — ALOX5AP , could mediate the biosynthesis of leu kotri ene s, providing a potential connection between inflammation and IS [ 12 – 15 ]. Fan Yet al. previously reported that the SNP (rs17222919) located in the promoter of  $A L O X5A P$   might be a protective factor for IS in Chinese Han population [ 16 ]. Thus, we hypothesized that the promoter CpG-SNPs in the  ALOX5AP  gene may regulate the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of gene via allele-specific DNA methyl ation (ASM), and then affect the genetic susceptibility of IS. To date, association study between the promoter CpGSNPs and DNA methyl ation of  ALOX5AP  gene with IS has not yet been reported.  

In our study, we made a two-stage association study to identify a potential associated CpG-SNP (rs4073259) that located in the promoter region of  $A L O X5A P$   gene by SNaPshot genotyping approach firstly. And then, the methyl ation levels of   $17\ \mathrm{CpG}$   sites located in the promoter of  ALOX5AP  were tested by Methyl Target sequencing. Finally, the in vitro luciferase assay was done to estimate the effect of   $\mathsf{C p G-S N P}$   on gene expression.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study population  

One hundred fifty IS patients recruited from departments of neurology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University and the First People ’ s Hospital of Zhengzhou from March 2015 to March 2016 (76 males and 74 females, mean age of   $60.7\pm12.8$   years) were included in our initial study. And 400 IS patients (200 males and 200 females, mean age of  $60.5\pm12.5$   years) were recruited in the second cohort. IS was diagnosed by the diagnostic criteria of IS revised in the fourth session of national conference on cerebro vascular disease. Brain imaging was carried out by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Ancillary diagnostic investigations and standardized blood tests were also performed. We excluded the patients with cerebral hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, hyperthyroidism, card i oem boli c stroke, venous thrombo- sis, liver disorders, or kidney diseases. All the patients were first ever stroke. Fasting blood samples from the patients were collected within  $24\,\mathrm{h}$   after stroke symptom onset.  

The control groups consisted of 155 (population 1: 78 males and 77 females, mean age of   $60.9\pm13.3$   years) and 400 (population 2: 200 males and 200 females, mean age of  $62.5\pm13.2$   years) selected from the same area. And they were well matched with the IS patients by age and gender. The participants were all from the Henan Han population.  

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research of Zhengzhou University and all the subjects provided written informed consent.  

# SNP selection and identification of CpG-SNPs  

We retrieved the DNA sequences of the variants from the dbSNP database ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ) to determine if the selected SNPs were CpG-SNPs. The SNP that removes or introduces a CpG site was considered to be a CpG-SNP. In the present study, we selected three CpG-SNPs (rs146576796, rs4073259, and rs115053311) in the promoter of  ALOX5AP  gene.  

# Genotyping analysis  

TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) was used to extract genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples according to the manufacturer ’ s recommendations and quantified by NanoDrop 2000. Three potential CpG-SNPs were genotyped by Sanger sequencing in the initial study. To validate the association between the positive associated CpG-SNP with IS, the genotype was done using the SNaPshot genotyping approach. The DNA amplification primers were as follows: forward primer CCAAAGGC TTC ACC T CT GATA and reverse primer GAGAAAAG T CCA GCC AT TCG. A   $15~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   mixture containing   $1~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   template DNA,   $1.5\;\upmu1\;10\times$   buffer,   $1.5\ \upmu1\ \mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$  ,    $0.3\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   dNTP,  $0.3\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   forward primer,   $0.3\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   reverse primer,   $0.3\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   Taq polymerase, and   $9.8\,\upmu\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$   was prepared for each reaction. The cycling program was   $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $3\ \mathrm{min}$  ; 35 cycles of  $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\,\mathrm{~s~}$  ,   $55~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,\mathrm{~s~}$  , and   $72\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,\mathrm{~s~}$  ; and  $72\,\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 3 min. And we designed the primer G GCC T CT GC A CGT GC TC TG CGC for multiplex PCR extension. The reaction mixture contained   $5~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   SNaPshot Multiplex reaction mix (Applied Biosystems, USA),   $2~\upmu\mathrm{l}$  purified PCR product,   $1~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   extension primer mix, and  $2~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O}$  . The cycling program was   $96\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $1\,\mathrm{{min}}$  , 30 cycles of   $96\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\,\mathrm{s}$  ,  $52\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $5\:\mathrm{s}$  , and  $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\:\mathrm{s}$  . Finally, a mixture of  $1\;\upmu\mathrm{l}$   purified extension product,   $1\;\upmu1\,\mathrm{Liz}120$   size standard, and  $8~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   HiDi formamide was denatured at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for  $4~\mathrm{min}$  . Then, the mixture was loaded onto ABI3730xl instrument (ABI, USA). At last, we adopted the Gene Mapper 4.1 (Applied Biosystems, USA) to analyze the results.  

# DNA methyl ation analysis  

We selected   $^{17}\mathrm{~CpG}$   sites in the promoter of  ALOX5AP gene to make DNA methyl ation analysis. TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) was used to extract genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions and quantified by NanoDrop 2000. Bisulfite conversion of DNA was manipulated with EZ DNA methyl ation-gold kit (ZYMO, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer ’ s recommendations. Then,   $2~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   DNA sample in   $20~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   amplification reaction system, including   $1\times$   reaction buffer (TaKaRa),   $2\,\mathrm{\mM}$   $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$  ,  $0.2\ \mathrm{mM}$   dNTP,   $0.1\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$   of each primer, and   $1\,\mathrm{\DeltaU}$  HotStarTaq polymerase (TaKaRa), was amplified with PCR. The cycling program was as the following:   $95\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for   $2\ \mathrm{min}$  ; 11 cycles of  $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20 s,   $63–0.5\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per cycle for  $40~\mathrm{s}$  , and   $72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\ \mathrm{min}$  ; 24 cycles of   $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $20~\mathrm{s}$  ,  $65~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}$  , and  $72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\ \mathrm{min}$  ; and   $72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $2~\mathrm{min}$  . Then, samples were added with a specific tag sequence. A  $20~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   mixture was prepared for each reaction and included  $1\times$   reaction buffer (NEB Q5TM),  $0.3~\mathrm{mM}$   dNTP,   $0.25~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  of F primer,   $0.25~\ensuremath{\,\upmu\mathrm{M}}$   of index primer, 1 U Q5TM DNA polymerase (NEB), and   $1~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   diluted template. The cycling program was   $98\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30s; 11 cycles of   $98\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\textup{s}$  ,  $65\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\;\mathrm{s}$  , and   $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\:\mathrm{s}$  ; and   $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $5\;\mathrm{min}$  , then loaded onto Illumina NextSeq 500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to analyze the results.  

# Quantitative real-time PCR  

RNAprep Pure Blood Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) was used to extract total RNA according to the manufacturer ’ s recommendations and quantified by NanoDrop 2000. Total RNA (  $300~\mathrm{ng}$   for each participant) was reversely transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using FastKing RT Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer ’ s recom mend at ions. RT-PCR amplification was performed with the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The PCR primer pairs were as follows:    $A L O X5A P$  forward primer CC T GAA GC AAA CAT GG AT CA, reverse primer GC TC CAC TTT AT GG GC A A AG and  $\upbeta$  -actin forward primer TG GC A CCC AG CACA AT GAA, reverse primer CTA A GTC AT AGT CC GCC TAG A A GC A. The PCR reaction was performed using 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher) with the following program: a prede natura tion was at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}$   and 40 cycles of   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for   $3\mathrm{~s~}$  ,   $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}$  , and   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $15\mathrm{~s~}$  . The dissolution curve was drawn at  $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}$   and   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $15~\mathrm{s}.$   The internal reference was    $\upbeta$  -actin and the relative expression levels were expressed relative to it, which was calculated with the  $2^{-\Delta\Delta\mathrm{ct}}$    method.  

# Promoter – luciferase constructs and luciferase assay  

Luciferase assay was assigned to detect whether rs4073259 modulated the transcriptional activity of the  ALOX5AP  promoter. Primers (forward primer ACT G GT ACCA AGT G TTC CT CT GC A GC T GC, reverse primer CCGAGATC T CAT GAA AAC A GC ACC CAC GG) were designed to amplify the  ALOX5AP  promoter fragments containing rs4073259   $(379{\mathrm{~\mathsf{b p}}})$  ). Next, the Kpn I and Bgl II restriction end on uc leases (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) were used to insert the target fragment in top GL 3 promoter.Positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Shanghai Sheng Gong, Shanghai, China). For luciferase reporter assays, HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with   $10\%$   fetal bovine se- rum (Hyclone, USA) at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   in a humidified incubator containing   $5\%\,\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  . The HE K 293 T cells were plated at a density of   $2\times10^{5}$    per well in 24-well format, then co-trans fec ted with 4 ng pRL-TK and 80 ng pGL3-promoter construct by  $2~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of Simple-fect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions, cultured for   $48\;\mathrm{h}$  . We used the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to test the relative luciferase activity. And the firefly luciferase activities were adjusted with reference to  Renilla  luciferase activities. Each reporter was examined for three independent experiments.

variables were expressed with mean  $\pm\,\mathrm{SD}$   and analyzed by the Student ’ s    $t$   test. The qualitative variables and allele/ genotype frequencies were analyzed by Pearson ’ s chisquared test. We used the SHEsis software to make the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test. And the   $95\%$  confidence intervals   $(C I{\mathrm{s}})$   and odds ratios   $(O R\mathrm{{s})}$   were calculated to test the association between risk factors and IS. Statistical analyses of the methyl ation levels and mRNA expression among different genotypes were performed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections.    $P$   values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  

# Results  

# Clinical characteristics of subjects  

The two populations ’  clinical characteristics in this study were shown in Table  1 . The results showed no significant difference in age and sex between IS cases and controls in those two populations   $(P>0.05)$  . The IS cases had higher percentage of hypertension in those two populations   $(P<0.05)$  . The total cholesterol and total triglyceride levels in IS cases were significantly higher than that in controls   $(P\!<\!0.05)$  .  

# Association analysis and genetic model analysis  

We made association study between three potential   $\mathrm{CpG-}$  SNPs and IS in the first population. And we found that the frequency of G allele at rs4073259 in IS cases   $(38.3\%)$   was significantly lower than that   $(48.1\%)$   in controls (  $\left.P=0.015\right\}$  ). While there existed no polymorphic of rs 146576796 and rs 115053311 in our initial study (Table  2 ). Then, we made further study with the relationship between rs4073259 and IS.  

The genotype distributions and allele frequencies of rs4073259 in those two populations were shown in Table  3 . The Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium was tested at rs4073259 in the cases and controls and showed no significant deviation

  $(P>0.05)$  . The frequency of G allele at rs4073259 in IS cases

  $(42.2\%)$   was significantly lower than that in controls   $(47.5\%)$  in population 2   $\left(P=0.035\right)$  ,    $O R=0.809$  ,   $95\%$   CI  0.664 –

 0.985), which was consistent with that in population 1   $P\!=$  0.015,    $O R\,{=}\,0.672$  ,  $,95\%\,C I\,0.487{-}0.927)$  . The frequencies of GG genotype individuals in IS cases (  $15.4\%$   and   $17.5\%$  , respectively) were significantly lower than those in controls

  $(21.9\%$   and   $20.8\%$  , respectively) in those two populations

 (  $\left_{\rightmoon}P\!=\!0.024$  ,    $O R=0.467$  ,   $95\%$     $C I\!=\!0.240\!–\!0.907$  ;    $P\,{=}\,0.045$  ,  $O R\,{=}\,0.658$  ,   $95\%$     $C I\!=\!0.437\!\!-\!\!0.991$  , respectively). We made analyses of dominant, recessive, and additive genetic models to assess the effects of rs4073259 on the risk of IS. And the

# CpG-SNP associated with IS affect DNA methyl ation  

The impact of IS-associated CpG-SNP rs4073259 on DNA methyl ation was detected by Methyl Target sequencing. We tested the methyl ation levels of   $17\ \mathrm{CpG}$   sites located in the promoter region of  ALOX5AP . As shown in Fig.  1 , rs4073259 that just located in the  $\mathrm{CpG8}$   site has shown differential DNA methyl ation status   $(P\!<\!0.05)$  . The methyl ation levels of individuals with G allele were significantly higher than those with A allele, presenting the phenomenon of ASM. However, another  $16\,\mathrm{CupG}$   sites were not associated with differential DNA methyl ation (Fig.  2 ).  

# Association between CpG-SNP and mRNA expression  

The higher DNA methyl ation levels of some certain genome regions might result in transcriptional silencing. We therefore  

![](images/b1e2222505c9f37137ce8b35c42a358a7d1dc5a0b04f5ba223edc5f985827a88.jpg)

tested if individuals with G allele which owes a higher DNA methyl ation level have a lower mRNA expression of  $A L O X5A P$   gene. We found that GG genotype carriers that have a higher DNA methyl ation level also have a lower mRNA expression level of  ALOX5AP  (Figs.  3  and  4 ).  

# Promoter activity analysis of rs4073259  

Increased DNA methyl ation might decrease the mRNA expression via decreasing the transcriptional activity of promoter. Therefore, we investigated whether rs4073259 could affect the transcriptional activity of the  ALOX5AP  promoter in HEK293T cells by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. We found that the G allele had got a lower luciferase activity than that of A allele (  $\left.\begin{array}{r l}{\gamma_{P}=0.000}\end{array}\right.$  ; Fig.  5 ), suggesting that the G allele has got a lower transcriptional activity than the A allele.  

# Discussion  

In our study, we made a two-stage association study to screen the positive CpG-SNPs of  ALOX5AP  gene, and then explore the relationship among CpG-SNPs, methyl ation levels, and mRNA expression levels. Our findings showed that CpGSNP rs4073259 associated with IS affected DNA methyl ation and then regulated the mRNA expression via ASM. As far as we know, the study was to evaluate the possible mechanism through which CpG-SNPs affect gene function via epigenetics in IS. The result verified our hypothesis that the promoter CpG-SNPs in the  ALOX5AP  gene might regulate the mRNA expression of gene via ASM, and then affect the genetic susce pti bil it y of IS.

Some SNPs that located in Cp Gdi nucleotides might result in an increase or removal of aC pG site.Forexample,aT-to-C transition on  B T ^ ofCpG dinucleotide s leads to an increase of a CpG site. Thus, we defined those variants as CpG-SNPs [ 17 ]. Firstly, we selected three CpG-SNPs that located in the promoter region of  ALOX5AP  gene to screen the positiverelated CpG-SNPs by Sanger sequencing. Our results showed that rs4073259 polymorphism was significantly associated with IS in the initial study   $(P=0.015\$  ,  $O R=0.672$  ,  $95\%$   CI  0.487 – 0.927), while the other two CpG-SNPs (rs 146576796 and rs 115053311) were not polymorphic. To verify the accuracy of our founding, we genotyped a larger population by SNaPshot genotyping approach. And the association was still existed in the second population    $(P\!=$  0.035,    $O R=0.809$  ,   $95\%$   CI  0.664 – 0.985). Then, we per- formed genetic association analyses with dominant, recessive,and additive models.And the rs 4073259 was associated with IS in dominant and additive genetic models   $\scriptstyle P\,<$  0.05).Our results were consistent with Zhang SYet al. [ 18 ], who showed that  ALOX5AP  rs4073259 was associated with riskofIS.But it was completely different from those reported by Zhang R et al. [ 19 ], who reported that rs4073259 was not associated with IS in a northeastern Chinese Han population. Those controversial results might be due to different populations, phenotype heterogeneity or sample sizes. Therefore, further studies with different populations are required to confirm the findings.  

The removal or introduction of CpG sites, which are possible DNA methyl ation sites, might provide a potential mechanism through which SNPs could affect gene function via epigenetics [ 20 ]. Therefore, we selected   $17\ \mathrm{CpG}$   sites in the promoter region of    $A L O X5A P$   gene to make DNA

methyl ation analysis among different CpG-SNP genotypes of rs4073259. Interestingly, we found that the methyl ation level of CpG8 (CpG-SNP rs4073259) was obviously different from others because of generating a CpG site. CpG-SNP rs4073259 was associated with differential DNA methyl ation, presenting the phenomenon of ASM which might elucidate the phenotypic effects of genetic variants. Gertz J et al. [ 21 ] had identified that the CpG-SNP might have effects on the methyl ation status of adjacent CpG sites because of the presence of some active sites on DNMT3a, which allow for the methyl ation of two adjacent CpG sites at the same time. While Dayeh TA et al. [ 22 ] found not all the CpG-SNPs had association with the DNA methyl ation status of surrounding CpG sites. Our results revealed that there exist no obvious differences among different genotypes in the methyl ation levels of surrounding   $16\;\mathrm{CupG}$   sites.  

As an important way of epigenetic modification, DNA methyl ation at the promoter of a gene is a powerful mechanism of gene expression regulation. And the mRNA expression levels among different genotypes were compared in the study. The results showed that the  ALOX5AP  mRNA expression level was significantly lower in individuals with GG genotype   $(P\!<\!0.05)$  . Previous studies indicated that the hypermethyl ation in the promoter region could result in low mRNA expression level [ 23 – 25 ]. To elucidate the specific mechanism, we adopted the luciferase assay to examine the transcription activity of different allele. Our results revealed that the G allele has a lower transcription activity than A allele, suggesting that the G allele with high methyl ation level could down regulate the gene expression. Previous studies have

identified that the direct combination of methyl-CpG binding proteins (MeCPs) with methylated DNA plays a crucial role in gene suppressing [ 26 ]. Therefore, the G allele with high methylation level might bind to MeCPs easier than A allele, resulting in the transcription suppressing of  ALOX5AP  gene. On the basis of these preliminary results, we proposed a possible molecular mechanism as follows: the G allele of rs4073259 down re gul ated  $A L O X5A P$   transcription via ASM. The decreased  ALOX5AP transcription in activates 5-LO pathway and reduces biosynthesis of leu kotri ene, which might be a protective factor of IS.  

There were several limitations needed to be mentioned in our study. First, the sample size of our study may not be sufficiently large to evaluate gene – environment interactions. Secondly, the selection of the cases and controls might exist some potential selection bias since they were all recruited from hospital.  

# Conclusion  

In conclusion, we made a two-stage study to discuss the relationship among CpG-SNPs, methyl ation levels, and mRNA expression levels of  ALOX5AP  gene. And our study provided a possible molecular mechanism through which IS-related CpG-SNP rs4073259 may affect the expression level of ALOX5AP  through allele-specific methyl ation and consequently the phenotype of the disease.
