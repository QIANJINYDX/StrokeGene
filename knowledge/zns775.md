Brain-derived neuro troph ic factor(BDNF)has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for post-stroke recovery in rodents.Fromthese observations, we and others have hypothesized that a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the pro-domain of  bdnf  that leads to a methionine (Met) substitution for valine (Val) at codon 66 (Val66Met) will affect stroke outcome. Here we investigate the effect of the BDNF genetic variant on ischemic outcome by using mice with a genetic knock-in of the human BDNF variant in both alleles  $(B D N F^{M e t/M e t})$  ).  Compared with wild-type mice,  BDNF Met/Met   mice exhibited reduced CNS BDNF levels without a discern able effect on infarct size. Diminished BDNF levels in  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice were associated with greater deficits in post-stroke locomotor functions. Additionally, the  BDNF Met/Met   mice showed reduced ang io genesis and elevated expression of th rom bos pond in-1 (TSP-1) and its receptor CD36, anti-angiogenic factors. To assess the functional role of CD36 in antagonizing angiogenic response in Met homo zy gos it y at the BDNF locus, we crossed  BDNF Met/Met   mice with CD36 knock-out  mice. The double-mutant mice rescued the angiogenic deficit associated with the  BDNF Met/Met   mice without alterations in BDNF levels, indicating that the behavioral deficit in  BDNF Met/Met   mice after stroke is partly related to an unfavorable balance in pro-angiogenic BDNF and anti-angiogenic TSP-1/CD36. The results suggest that CD36 inhibit ion maybe a viable strategy to enhance ang io genesis and possible recovery in human stroke victims who are Met homozygotes at codon 66 of the BDNF locus.  

# Introduction  

Unlike vas cul o genesis, neo ang io genesis after stroke involves sprouting of new vessels from preexisting vessels (Hayashi et al., 2006). Enhanced ang io genesis in the ischemic penumbra is correlated with increased survival of stroke patients (Krupinski et al., 1994). Furthermore, the promotion of ischemia-induced angiogenesis within the ischemic boundary was suggested as a therapeutic strategy to improve stroke outcome (Rosell-Novel et al., 2004; Slevin et al., 2006).  

Brain-derived neuro troph ic factor (BDNF) promotes neuronal survival, differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and ang io genesis in normal and ischemic tissue (Donovan et al., 2000; Chao, 2003; Kermani et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2005; Tongiorgi, 2008). BDNF expression is up regulated in the boundary of the infarct with much less expression in the infarct core (Kokaia et al., 1995, 1998). Whereas most studies indicate that enhanced BDNF availability and signaling ameliorate ischemic brain damage and functional recovery, some argue against the beneficial effect of BDNF (Gustafsson et al., 2003; Nygren et al., 2006).  

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the  bdnf  gene, which results in the substitution of a valine (Val) to a methionine (Met) in the prodomain of the BDNF protein, was identified. This exclusively human SNP occurs with relatively high frequency (Ventriglia et al., 2002; Egan et al., 2003; Itoh et al., 2004; He et al., 2007). Identified as the first genetic alteration in the neuro troph in system, the BDNF has been implicated in conferring susceptibility to various neuro psychiatric disorders and altered episodic memory in patients with psychiatric disease (Sklar et al., 2002; Egan et al., 2003; Sen et al., 2003). Although studies on the impact of the BDNF polymorphism in the outcome after ischemic stroke are limited, clinical studies suggest a correlation of this BDNF polymorphism with poor outcome in hemorrhagic stroke patients (Siironen et al., 2007; Vilkki et al., 2008).  

Ang io genesis is tightly regulated by factors that promote as well as inhibit vessel formation. Whereas BDNF evokes proangiogenic responses in the ischemic hindlimb (Kermani et al., 2005; Kermani and Hempstead, 2007), ischemia also up regulates the ang io static receptor CD36 in the post-ischemic brain (Cho et al., 2005). CD36 is expressed in the micro vascular endothelium, and the interaction of CD36 with th rom bos pond in (TSP)-1 and TSP-2 mediates a signaling cascade that leads to endo the li al cell apoptosis (JimeÂ´nez et al., 2000; Febbraio et al., 2001), offsetting compensatory ang io genesis-promoting cascades. Although CD36 expression is relatively low in the normal brain, increased expression of CD36 and TSPs has been reported after cerebral ischemia (Hayashi et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2005). The current study investigates the impact of BDNF SNP on ischemic outcome and angiogenic response using mice with a genetic knock-in of the human  bdnf  Val66Met variant. This study clarifies potential interactions between angiogenic and ang io static factors to regulate ang io genesis in the post-ischemic brain. We report that the BDNF SNP contributed to reductions in strokeinduced BDNF release, poorer behavioral outcome, and deficits in angiogenic response. We also determined that the absence of CD36 can rescue the ang io genesis deficit in mice with the BDNF SNP.  

# Materials and Methods  

Animals.  The use of animals and procedures performed were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Experiments were performed in  $B D N F^{+/+}$  wild-type and  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mutant mice generated and housed at Weill Cornell Medical College. These mice were back crossed 10 times into the C57BL/6 strain, and the procedures for heterozygote breeding and genotyping were described previously (Chen et al., 2006). CD36 knock-out (KO) mice were generated by Dr. Maria Febbraio at Weill Cornell Medical College and back crossed seven times into the C57BL/6 strain. The procedures for breeding and genotyping were described previously (Febbraio et al., 1999, 2000).  $B D\check{N}F^{M e t/\hat{M}e t}/\check{C}D36^{-/-}$    double mutants (Dmt) (  $(8\times$   back crossed C57BL/6) and background matching    $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}/$   $C D36^{+/+}$    controls (Dwt) were generated by crossing  $B\bar{D}N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice with CD36 KO mice. All mouse lines were housed at the Burke Medical Research Institute.  

Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.  Procedures for middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were described previously (Cho et al., 2005, 2007). Both male and female mice were used to determine infarct volume and percentage hemispheric swelling. For the rest of the study, only male mice were used. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane/oxygen/nitrogen. A fiber optic probe was glued to the right parietal bone (  $2~\mathrm{mm}$   posterior and  $5~\mathrm{mm}$   lateral to bregma) and connected to a laser-Doppler flowmeter (Periflux System 5010; Perimed) for continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the center of the ischemic territory. For MCAO, a 6-0 Teflon-coated black mono filament surgical suture (Doccol Co.) was inserted into the exposed external carotid artery, advanced into the internal carotid artery, and wedged into the cerebral arterial circle to obstruct the origin of the MCA. The filament was left in place for  $30\,\textrm{min}$   and then withdrawn. Only animals that exhibited both a reduction in CBF  ${>}80\%$   during MCAO and a recovery of CBF  ${>}80\%$   by  $10~\mathrm{min}$   after reperfusion were included in the study. This procedure leads to similar blood flow reduction and reperfusion among the groups and to reproducible infarcts involving both the cerebral cortex and the striatum in the right hemisphere (Cho et al., 2005).  

Behavior testing.  Functional outcome was assessed using a rotarod (Med Associates) and a Noldus Catwalk XT gait analysis system (Noldus Information Technology). These rotarod and Catwalk systems were used to assess functional recovery after stroke and other CNS injury (Hamers et al., 2006; Liauw et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008; Neumann et al., 2009). For the rotarod test, the device was set to accelerate from 4 to  $40\,\mathrm{rpm}$   over the course of  $5~\mathrm{min}$  . The animals were pretrained 6 consecutive days before ischemia, and post-stroke testing was performed 6 d after MCAO. The latency to fall from the rod (performance) was recorded and averaged for five trials. For the Catwalk gait analysis system, mice were pretrained daily for 2 weeks to cross an illuminated glass walkway three consecutive times and then tested at 1 d, 4 d, 7 d, 2 weeks, and 1 month after MCAO. The images from each trial that consist of three consecutive runs were converted into digital signals. After classification of each footprint, spatial parameters based on individual paws (maximum contact area and mean intensity), relative positions between paws [stride length and base of support (BOS)], temporal parameters (stand and swing speed), and parameter related to interlimb coordination (regularity index) were determined.

No difference in ischemic outcomes was found between the genotypes.  $\eta=11{-}15$   per group.  

Tissue preparation.  Mice were killed 3 or 7 d after MCAO. Brains were excised, frozen, and sectioned using a cryostat. Because infarct typically spans  ${\sim}6~\mathrm{mm}$   rost roca u dally starting from  $+2.8\;\mathrm{mm}$   from bregma and extending to  $-3.8\,\mathrm{mm}$  , we used an unbiased stereo logical sampling strategy to collect tissue in this region that included infarct. Tissue sections were collected serially for measurement of infarct volume/immunohisto chemistry   $.20\;\mu\mathrm{m}$   thickness) and for gene expression and ELISA (100  $\mu\mathrm{m})$  ) at a  $600\ \mu\mathrm{m}$   intervals.  

Measurement of infarct volume and swellings.  Infarct volume and percentage hemispheric swelling were determined in serial sections using Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss). The contribution resulting from swelling was corrected using a method described previously (Lin et al., 1993).  

BDNF ELISA.  The BDNF protein concentrations were determined in the brain lysates using the BDNF Emax immuno as say system, recombinant mature BDNF as a standard according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega).  

Immuno his to chemistry.  Brain sections were completely air dried and subsequently fixed in    $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   methanol for  $2{-}3\ \mathrm{min}$   or  $4\%$   paraformaldehyde for  $15\,\mathrm{{min}}$  , then washed three times in PBS at  $\mathrm{pH}\,7.4$  , and incubated in  $0.2\%$   Triton X-100 for  $5~\mathrm{min}$  . After washing with PBS, slides were blocked in  $1\%$   BSA (Sigma) in PBS containing   $5\%$   normal goat serum for  $^{\mathrm{~1~h~}}$   at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies: Ki-67 (cell proliferation marker, 1:000; Abcam), CD31 (endo the li al marker, 1:1000; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents), CD36 (1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocytes marker, 1:3000; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents). Sections were washed with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (1:200; Invitrogen) for  $^{\mathrm{~1~h~}}$   at room temperature, and cover slipped to examine under a florescent microscope or laser scanning confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss).  

Assessment of proliferating endo the li al cells.  Double-fluorescence immu no his to chemistry of Ki-67 and CD31 was performed  $^{3\mathrm{~d~}}$   after ischemia. Using a laser scanning confocal microscope, the number of proliferating endo the li al cells was identified by nuclear staining of Ki-67 juxtaposed CD31-immuno reactive endo the li al cells in the entire infarct area. The density of proliferating endo the li al cells was obtained from the total number of Ki-67/CD31-positive   $\left({\mathrm{CD}}31\right)^{+}$  ) cells divided by the entire infarct area.

Assessment of vessel density.  Double-fluorescence immuno his to chemistry of GFAP and CD31 was performed 7 d after ischemia. To quantify vessel density, we modified our published nonbiased counting method (Cho et al., 1997). A  $10\times10$   grid in a  $0.1\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$    frame was placed along the glial scar that is demarcated by GFAP immuno reactivity as shown in Figure 4 G . For each animal,  ${\mathrm{CD}}31\,^{+}$    vessels that cross grid lines were counted in a section (  $\cdot+1.2\;\mathrm{mm}$   from bregma). The number of intersections within a frame was counted and averaged from 7â10 randomly chosen inner and outer fields along the glial scar. The total number of intersections from the field was averaged to represent an inner and outer vessel density for each animal. Values were presented as number of inter sections per frame area   $(0.1\;\mathrm{mm}^{2}$  ).  

Real-time reverse transcription-PCR for CD36, CD47, and TSP-1/2 gene expression.  Relative mRNA levels of CD36, CD47, and TSP-1/2 were quantified with real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using fluorescent TaqMan technology (Cho et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008). Total RNA

Total RNA from brain tissues was reverse transcribed using oligo-dT primers and the SuperScript FirstStrand Synthesis System (Invitrogen), according to the protocol of the manufacturer.PCRprimers and probes specific for CD47, CD36, and TSP $1/2$   and  $\beta$  -actin were obtained as TaqMan predeveloped assay reagents for gene expression (Applied Biosystems).  $\beta$  -Actin was used as an internal control for normalization of samples. The PCR reaction was performed using Fast Start Universa l Probe Master(Roche)and Applied Bios ystem s 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system,according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Reactions were performed in  $20\;\mu\mathrm{l}$   total volume and incubated at  $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for  $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$  , followed by 40 cycles of  $15\,s$   at  $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   and 1 min at  $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The results were analyzed by 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System software.  

Statistics.  Data are presented as mean    $\pm$  SEM. All analyses were performed, and analyzed data were graphed using GraphPad Software Prism 4.0. Comparisons between two groups were statistically evaluated by the Studentâs  t  test. Multiple comparisons were made using two-way ANOVA. Differences were considered significant at  $p<0.05$  .  

# Results Mice with the BDNF SNP exhibit reduced stroke-induced BDNF levels without affecting injury size  

To investigate the effect of the BDNF Val66Met SNP on ischemic outcome, we first determined whether the BDNF SNP has an effect on stroke-induced BDNF levels in the brain. Because ischemia upregulates BDNF transcript and protein expression (Kokaia et al., 1995; Krikov et al.,  

parameter related to individual paws, showed a progressive de- crease, with the greatest deficits at 7 d after ischemia in all four paws, and returned to baseline levels at 2 weeks and 1 month after ischemia (Fig. 2 B ). Other spatial and temporal parameters, including mean intensity, stride length, stand, swing speed, and regularity index, show a similar temporal pattern except BOS, which increases over 1 month after ischemia (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The gait function between the genotypes was compared at  $7\,\mathrm{d},2$  weeks, and 1 month after ischemia. Compared with  $B D N\!F^{+/+}$  

2008), we initially determined temporal changes in strokeinduced BDNF level using an entire hemisphere of C57BL/6 mice. Stroke-induced BDNF levels were increased at 3â7 d (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Using these time points, tissue was serially sectioned through the infarct territory (see Materials and Methods), and stroke-induced BDNF levels were compared.    $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice exhibited lower BDNF levels relative to wild type at 3 and 7 d after ischemia, with a larger difference at 3 d (Fig. 1 A , B ). Infarct size and hemispheric swelling, assessed at  $3\textup{d}$   after ischemia between two genotypes, were not different in both genders (Fig.  $^{1C,D}$  ). No differences in cerebral blood flow reduction and reperfusion during and 10 min after ischemia suggests that the severity of ischemia was comparable between  $B D N\!F^{\bar{+}\bar{+}}$    and  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e\dot{t}}$    mice (Table 1). The dissociation between BDNF levels and ischemic outcomes indicates that the amount of BDNF in the post-ischemic brain is not a critical factor for acute infarct development.  

mice,    $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice showed greater deficits in maximum contact area in all paws at  $^{7\textrm{d}}$   after ischemia. Reduced pressure exerted on the glass plate (mean intensity) in left and right hindpaws, shorter stride length in left hindpaws, shorter duration for the paw to contact the plate (stand) in left hindpaws and right forepaws, and the slower speed of the paw during swing (swing speed) in left hindpaws were found (Fig. 2 C ). Importantly, several  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice exhibited paw pressure below detection limit during the acute phase   $\scriptstyle(<7\mathrm{~d})$  ), whereas all of  $B D N\!F^{+/+}$  mice were in detection range, indicating that    $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice exhibited a greater deficit. Within  $B D\bar{N}F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice, we were unable to detect paw pressure in three of nine for forepaws and one of nine for hindpaws at the contra lateral side at  $^{7\mathrm{~d~}}$  . This indicates greater deficits in the forepaw than hindpaw at this time. For data presentation, instead of arbitrarily assigning zero for these undetected animals,we performed statistical analysis only in animals

Post-ischemic motor function was assessed in  $B D N F^{+/+}$    and  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice. There was no difference between the genotypes in rotarod performance before ischemia. Compared with  $\dot{B D N F}^{+/+}$    mice,  $\hat{B}D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice showed a significantly larger deficit 6 d after stroke (Fig. 2 A ).

that registered enough paw pressure. Thus, this quantitative comparison underestimates the deficit of forepaw. No difference was found in BOS (a parameter for the relative positions between paws)  $(B D N F^{+/+}$    vs  $B\bar{D}N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$  : forepaws,  $5.8\ \pm\ 2.1$   vs  $7.2\,\pm\,1.4~\mathrm{mm}$  ; hindpaws,  $12.7\pm4.2$  vs  $14.2\pm2.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  ;NS).Although  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$  mice showed a reduced regularity index (a parameter for degree of interlimb coordination), it did not reach statistical significance  $(B D N F^{+/+}$  vs  $,B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$  t :  $67.2\pm7.2$  vs  $40.6\pm10.9\%;p=0.0515)$  ). All these deficits in the paws contra lateral to the stroked side in  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice are indicative of unstable and impaired gait in the acutestage.Although  $B D N\boldsymbol{F}^{+/+}$  mice returned to baseline at 2 weeks after ischemia,  $B D\bar{N}F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice showed deficits in maximum contact area in left hindpaw and mean intensity in left forepaw and left hindpaw (Fig.  $2D$  ). There were no behavior differences at 1 month after ischemia. These behavior results showed that  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice exhibited greater deficits in locomotor functions in an acute stage and delayed functional recovery compared with  $B D N\!F^{+/+}$    mice.  

# Mice with BDNF SNP exhibit reduced proliferating endo the li al cell and vessel density in the peri-infarct area  

To assess the effect of BDNF SNP on stroke-induced ang io genesis, the density of proliferating endo the li al cells was determined in the entire infarct area at  $3\textup{d}$   after ischemia as an index of ang io genesis. Confocal images of double immuno fluorescence showed that nuclear localization of Ki-67, a marker for proliferating cells, is juxtaposed to endo the li al  ${\mathrm{CD}}31^{\mathrm{~+~}}$    cells (Fig.  $^{3A,B,}$  , arrows). Quantitative analysis showed that the density of proliferating endo the li al cells was

To link the stroke-induced neo ang io geni c response to vessel formation, vessel density was determined in the infarct core and inner and outer margin of the infarct border 7 d after ischemia (Fig. 4 G ). No difference in vessel density was found between genotypes in naive controls (data not shown) or the contra lateral side 7 d after ischemia(supple- mental Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci. org as supplemental material). There was a strong GFA P immuno reactivity in the outer margin of the infarct border representing a glial scar in the ischemic hemisphere (Fig.  $^{4A,D,G)}$  ). Vessel densities in the outer margin of the infarct were not different between genotypes (Fig.   $^{4}\!{\cal B},\!E,\!H$  ). In contrast, the number of vessels in the inner margin of the infarct border were significantly lower in  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice compared with  $B D N\!F^{+/+}$  mice (Fig.  $^{4B,E,H}$  ), whereas both genotypes showed similarly reduced vessel density in the core (Fig.  $4C,F,H,$  ). The results show that ischemia induces angiogenesis primarily in the ischemic boundary zone, and BDNF Val66Met SNP influences ischemia-induced vascular iz ation in this area.

# Ang io static factors CD36 and TSP-1 are up regulated in  BDNF Met/Met   mice in response to ischemia  

New blood vessel growth is regulated by a well orchestrated balance between proangiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. To assess the impact of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on the expression of ang io static factors, we determined the expression of CD47, CD36, and TSPs. Ischemia reduced CD47 gene expression at 3 and 7 d to a similar degree between genotypes (Fig.  $5A,B$  ).

Unlike CD47, ischemia increased CD36 expression in both genotypes. Additionally, ischemia-induced CD36 mRNA levels in  $\dot{B D N F}^{M e t/M e t}$    mice were significantly elevated at   $^{3\mathrm{~d~}}$   compared with  $B D N F^{+/+}$    mice, and the increase was even more apparent at 7 d (Fig.  $^{5}\mathrm{C},\!D$  ). The increased CD36 gene expression in the  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice was associated with the increased number of CD36-immuno reactive cells at 7 d after occlusion (Fig.  $^{6,8,}$  ). Subsequent double immuno fluorescence revealed that many of the  ${\mathrm{CD}}36^{\,+}$    cells are endo the li al cells in the post-ischemic brain (Fig. 6 CâE ).  

TSP-1 and TSP-2 show high affinity toward CD36, which mediates a signaling cascade that leads to endo the li al cell apoptosis (JimeÂ´nez et al., 2000). Stroke induced TSP-1 mRNA levels were elevated in both genotypes at  $^{3\mathrm{~d~}}$   after ischemia (Fig. 7 A ). The increase of TSP-1 mRNA levels was sustained in  $\bar{B D N F}^{M e t/M e t}$  mice even at  $^{7\mathrm{~d~}}$   after ischemia, whereas the levels returned to baseline in  $B D N F^{+/+}$    mice (Fig. 7 B ). No significant differences were observed in TSP-2 mRNA levels between genotypes at these times (Fig.   $^{7C,D}$  ). The covariance of reduced BDNF levels and increase of TSP-1/CD36 in  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice shows an unfavor- able balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors that may result in reduced ang io genesis in these mice.

1). Because the tissue used for BDNF protein measurement in the ips i lateral side of the brain included normal non-injured, peri-infarct, and infarct area, the differences in the ischemic infarct territory be- tween the genotypes may be even larger. This finding is interesting in light of previous  in vitro  studies of the variant BDNF demonstrating defects in activity-dependent BDNF trafficking and secretion (Chen et al., 2004, 2005, 2006). Thus, reduced BDNF levels in the  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$  brains after ischemia may reflect the defect in activity-dependent secretion and intracellular trafficking at the site of the stroke.  

BDNF exists as pro and mature forms that use distinct receptors to mediate divergent neuronal actions. Mature BDNF exerts its biological functions via activation of TrkB, leading to endo the li al cell survival/proliferation, whereas proBDNF binds to  $\bar{\mathrm{p}}75^{\,\mathrm{NIR}}$    and can initiate apoptosis through sortilin, a co-receptor of  $\mathrm{p}\bar{7}5^{\mathrm{NIR}}$  (Nykjaer et al., 2004; Teng et al., 2005). Although our study does not distinguish pro from mature BDNF produced in postischemic brain, the positive link of total BDNF levels to ang io genesis between the genotypes suggests the presence of a sufficient amount of mature BDNF to elicit the biological function in the post-ischemic brains.  

cant increase   $(\sim\!10\%)$  ) in vessel density in the brain of Dwt mice relative to  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice. This may be attributable to a difference in their genetic background   $.8\times$   vs  $10\times$   back crossed to C57BL/6) (supplemental Fig. S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Stroke-induced BDNF levels were not different between Dmt and Dwt mice  $^{7}\textrm{d}$   after stroke (Fig.  $8\,D$  ). Dwt mice showed a significant reduction in vessel density in the inner margin of the infarct border but not in the contra lateral side or the outer margin of the infarct border (Fig. 8 A , B ). Notably, Dmt mice rescued the reduced vessel density observed in this region in the Dwt mice (Fig. 8 AâC ), suggesting that CD36 is sufficient to overcome the angiogenic deficit associated with BDNF SNP.  

The role of BDNF in cerebral ischemia is controversial. Whereas decreased expression of BDNF in haplo insufficient  $B D N F^{+/-}$    mice is associated with better motor performance and increased neuroblast number after experimental stroke (Nygren et al., 2006), enhanced BDNF availability and/or downstream signaling resulted in reduction or no effect in infarct size but promoted functional recovery (Endres et al., 2000; Kurozumi et al., 2004; SchaÂ¨bitz et al., 2004, 2007). Our study also shows no discern able differences in infarct size and swelling between the two genotypes. However, the reduced BDNF levels in  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice were associated with greater motor deficits and gait impairment in acute ischemia. In  $B D N F^{+/+}$    mice, the several deficits exhibited during the acute period   $\scriptstyle(<7\,\mathrm{d})$  ) returned to baseline at 2 weeks. However, the deficits in their paw pressure were still present in  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice at that time, indicating delay in functional recovery (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with the report that the presence of BDNF SNP is associated with poor outcome among survivors of hemorrhagic stroke in human study (Siironen et al., 2007). Despite the dissociation of BDNF levels with infarct size, the positive correlation of BDNF levels with locomotor function indicates the presence of underlying BDNFmediated events after stroke.  

# Discussion  

The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism has been linked to human psychiatric diseases. The variant affects the anatomy of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and the carriers of the polymorphism exhibit deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks (Egan et al., 2003; Hariri et al., 2003; Pezawas et al., 2004). Because stroke is a leading cause of disability and  ${>}20\%$  of Caucasians and up to  $70\%$  of the Asian population carry the BD NF SNP,understanding the impact of the genetic variant of BDNF on stroke pathology may offer significant insights into therapeutics to improve recovery for the patients that have this polymorphism.  

In response to ischemic insult and subsequent pathological events, regenerative and repair processes occur in affected tissues (Fan and Yang, 2007). Because enhanced ang io genesis in the ischemic penumbra is correlated with longer survival in stroke patients (Krupinski et al., 1994), the impact of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on ang io genesis in this region was investigated. The findings that  $B D\bar{N}F^{\bar{M}e t/M e t}$    mice have reduced BDNF levels, less proliferating endo the li al cells, and reduced vessel density in  

A mouse line with the BDNF Val66Met allele knocked in was generated that reproduces the phenotypic traits of humans with the variant (Chen et al., 2006). By using a transient focal ischemia in these mice, the present study showed that BDNF levels were much lower in  $B D\dot{N}F^{M e t/M e t}$    relative to the  $B D N F^{+/+}$    brain (Fig.  

the penumbra relative to  $B D N\!F^{+/+}$    mice suggests a causal link between BDNF levels and its functional role in stroke-induced ang io genesis.  

The current study shows an involvement of CD36 in the underlying mechanism(s) by which angiogenic deficits in  $B D N F^{M e t/}$  Met  occurs. CD36 has exhibited anti-angiogenic effects of TSP-1 in the corneal neo vascular iz ation assay, and blocking CD47 has been shown to increase tissue perfusion (Dawson et al., 1997; Isenberg et al., 2007). We found the suppression of the CD47 gene expression in the post-ischemic brain of  $\dot{B}D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    along with wild type, consistent with the report by Jin et al. (2009). The similar degree of reduction in CD47 mRNA levels between  $B D N\!F^{+/+}$    and    $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice indicates a minimal involvement of CD47 in regulating BDNF-induced ang io genesis after stroke. In contrast, we showed that ischemia not only induced the expression of CD36 and TSP-1, as reported by others (Hayashi et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2005), but also that the increase was further potenti a ted in the  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    brain. The relevance of the up regulation of CD36 in stroke pathology is its anti-angiogenic nature, which offsets compensatory ang io genesispromoting cascades in response to tissue ischemia. The reciprocal expression of angiogenic and ang io static factors found in  $B D N\bar{F}^{+/+}$    and  $B D N\breve{F}^{M e t/M e t}$    mice after ischemia thus suggests a possible BDNF-mediated inhibition of the CD36 pathway. The involvement of the CD36 pathway is also supported by the findings that there was a sustained elevation of TSP-1 gene expression in  $\widetilde{B}D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice up to 7 d after ischemia (Fig. 7 B ). Lack of increase in TSP-2 in these mice (Fig.  $^{7C,D}$  ) may be attributable to its delayed expression (Lin et al., 2003). It has been shown that TSP-1 and TSP-2 are also involved in other long-term recovery functions such as syn ap to genesis and axonal sprouting (Liauw et al., 2008). These studies showed a distinct temporal and spatial expression of early TSP-1 and delayed TSP-2 expression after stroke. Consistent with the literature, our study also shows a selective increase of TSP-1 and localization of CD36 in the endothelial cell in the  $B D N\!F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice 3â7 d after ischemia. Therefore, it is conceivable that early TSP-1 expression may be primarily involved in inhibiting ang io genesis via CD36 during an acute post-stroke but TSP-2 in regulating synaptic plasticity in the long-term recovery through CD36 or other membrane receptors, including integrins, fi bron ect in, and gabapentin receptor  $\alpha2\delta{-1}$   (Adams and Lawler, 2004; Bornstein, 2009; Eroglu et al., 2009).  

The sufficiency to inhibit ang io genesis in  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice by elevated CD36 was further addressed. Dmt mice showed a complete rescue in vessel densities of Dwt mice without altering BDNF levels (Fig. 8). The finding that the absence of CD36 does not influence BDNF levels in the post-ischemic brain suggests that the inhibition of CD36 may act downstream of BDNF. Because of an intrinsic phenotype associated with CD36 deficiency, the behavior outcome in Dmt mice was not addressed. Unlike  $B D N\!F^{+/+}$    and  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$    mice that show no discern able difference in infarct volume, CD36 KO mice exhibit a significantly smaller infarct size, and the neuro protection resulted in better behavior outcome (Cho et al., 2005). In addition to its role in inhibiting ang io genesis, CD36 mediates free radical production, inflammation, and innate immunity that would influence the development of brain injury and behavior outcome. Thus, angiogenic rescue alone may not reflect behavior outcome in Dmt mice. Despite these caveats, the findings define a clear mechanistic insight by which elevated CD36 expression in  $B D N F^{M e t/M e t}$  mice is critical to inhibit stroke-induced ang io genesis.  

In summary, using knock-in mouse models of the human genetic variant of the BDNF polymorphism, the present study demonstrates that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism negatively influences post-stroke motor function, reduces angiogenesis, and elevates ang io static factors CD36 and TSP-1. Deletion of CD36 in  BDNF Met/Met   mice rescues the acute angiogenic deficits. This study links the Val66Met polymorphism to diminished stroke recovery and provides support for the notion that BDNF may influence recovery partly through affecting ang io genesis. It provides a potential stroke therapy that aims at promoting angiogenesis via targeting the CD36 pathway for BDNF Val66Met polymorphism carriers.
