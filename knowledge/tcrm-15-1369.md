Background:  Brain-derived neuro troph ic factor (BDNF) is the most abundant neuro troph in, which contributes to the neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity. This study investigated the associations of  BDNF  polymorphisms at the  $3^{\prime}$  -untranslated region with risk and outcome of ischemic stroke in a Chinese Han population.  

Methods:  500 patients and 520 controls were enrolled for  BDNF  rs7124442 genotyping. The binding of miR-922 to  BDNF  rs7124442 was examined by luciferase assay;  BDNF expression was assessed using qRT-PCR.  

Results:  Alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, diabetes, hypertension (all  $\mathrm{P}<0.001$  ) and higher serum triglycerides concentration (  $\mathrm{P}=0.009]$  ) were associated with an increased risk of developing ischemic stroke. After adjusted for age and sex, logistic regression analysis showed that IS patients harbored with rs7124442 TC genotype had a milder initial stroke (Dominant model:   $\mathrm{OR}=0.45$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.25–0.81$  ,  $\mathbf{P}=0.015)$  ), and also showed a better short-term recovery (Dominant model:   $\mathrm{OR}=0.39$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI=}0.24{-}0.68$  ,  $\mathbf{P}=0.003)$  ). Furthermore, we found that co-transfection of hsa-miR-922 mimics with  BDNF  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR containing the mutated allele C changed luciferase activity when compared to co-transfection with  BDNF    $3^{\prime}$  -UTR containing the wild-type allele. Besides, patients carrying  BDNF  rs712444 TC or CC genotype had an increased level of  BDNF  compared with patients with the TT genotype.  

Conclusion:  Our study demonstrates that the SNP rs7124442 in  BDNF    $3^{\prime}$  -UTR, through affecting the regulatory role of miR-922 in  BDNF  expression, might act as a protective factor for the outcome of patients with ischemic stroke.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a major reason for death and disability of people in the world.   Ischemic stroke (IS), which is usually caused by blockage of blood vessels, accounts for about   $80\%$   of all strokes. Previous data demonstrated that 6.9 million patients had ischemic stroke in 2013.   In China, the estimated mortality rate caused by stroke is 157 per 100,000 every year,   and the stroke burden continues to increase. Traditional risk factors of stroke include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, high blood cholesterol, etc., suggesting the important role of genetic factors in stroke.  

Brain-derived neuro troph ic factor (BDNF) is the most abundant neuro troph in, which contributes to the neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, ang io genesis and out,   growth of peripheral and central neurons. In experimental model studies of stroke, both intravenous and intra ventricular BDNF injections could reduce infarct size and showed neuro protective effects.   In addition, evidence showed that  BDNF  is associated with some neuro psychiatric disorders.   The most well-studied BDNF  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6265 has been reported to be related to brain morphology changes   6 and cortical plasticity. In the context of stroke, Qin et al 10   and Vliet et al reported that  BDNF  rs6265 polymorphism was associated with motor recovery of stroke patients. Thus, this study mainly focused on the contributions of  BDNF genetic variants to ischemic stroke.  

Micro RNAs (miRNA) can degrade mRNA by binding to its  $3^{\prime}$  -untranslated region (  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR), which is one of the posttranscriptional gene regulation mechanisms.   Previous studies have reported that SNPs in   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of mRNA were ,   associated with the occurrence of different diseases. In this study, we investigated the unreported SNPs in the  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of  BDNF . With the bioinformatics software ( http://www.bio guo.org/miRNASNP/ ), we predicted all candidate SNPs that may regulate  BDNF  expression. Polymorphism rs7124442 was identi ﬁ ed as the only potential SNP via regulating the binding of miR-922 and its relationship with ischemic stroke was further investigated.  

# Materials and Methods Study Subjects  

In this study, we included 500 ischemic stroke patients from Jiangyin People ’ s Hospital (Jiangyin, China) between June 2010 and August 2016. 520 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were also recruited. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed based on the World Health Organization criteria. A questionnaire was  ﬁ lled by all patients and controls. It contains demographic al information, medical history such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and other vascular risk factors. The de ﬁ nition of vascular risk factors has been detailed described in a previous study.   This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. An informed consent was signed by all participants and the Ethics Committee of Jiangyin People ’ s Hospital approved this study (Project identi ﬁ cation code: 2016 – 011).  

# Stroke Severity and Outcome Measures  

At the time of presentation and 3 months post-stroke, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was scored to measure stroke severity and functional changes of patients. The NIHSS score was skewed and not normally distributed, and thus it was dic hot omi zed for logistic regression analysis.  

The mild and severe IS cutoff score was set at 6, which is ,   consistent with previous studies. The score change from presentation to discharge ( Δ NIHSS) was used to measure the recovery of ischemic stroke. It was also skewed and dichotomized for logistic regression analysis. Its cutoff score was set at 0 and  ${<}0$   means clinical improvement.  

# DNA Extraction and Genotyping  

Total DNA of patients and controls was extracted on the basis of a standard protocol.   The TaqMan allelic discrimination assay was used to genotype the SNP (Applied Biosystems, San Diego, CA, USA). The PCR conditions were   $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 2 mins,  $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for 10 mins followed by 45 cycles of  $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for 15 s and  $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 1 min. The allelic discrimination mode of the SDS 2.3 software was used to calculate the results.  

# Quantitative Reverse  

# Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)  

The  BDNF  mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR. Brie ﬂ y, a Trizol reagent was used to isolate total RNA from 293T cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After that, a TaqMan Reverse Transcription Kit was used to reverse transcribe the RNA into cDNA (ABI, CA, USA). With Realmaster Mix (SYBR Green I) (TAKARA, Dalian, China), the qPCR ampli ﬁ cations were then performed under the following condition:   $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for 10 mins followed by 40 cycles of  $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for  $30~\mathrm{s},$  ,   $55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $40~\mathrm{s}$   and  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30~\mathrm{s},$  , and  ﬁ nally  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 mins.  

# Prediction of miRNAs Binding to the SNP  

The potential miRNAs that could be affected by SNPs in the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of  BDNF  were predicted by a bioinformatics software ( http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/miRNASNP2/ index.php ). In brief, the target sites of SNPs in   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR were predicted using two different methods. Four kinds of results are categorized as SNP targetscan site (ST), SNP miranda site (SM), wild targetscan site (WT), wild miranda site (WM). If a target shows both in ST and SM, but not in WT or WM, we called the gene gained the target site. On the other side, the gene lost the target site.  

# Construction of Plasmids and   $\mathfrak{z}^{\prime}$  -UTR Reporter Assay  

The  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR fragments containing the C or   $\mathrm{T}$   allele were ampli ﬁ ed using PCR and the results were veri ﬁ ed by DNA sequencing. Then, we cloned the PCR productions into the pGL3-promoter less luciferase-based plasmid (Promega, CA, USA) at the cloning site between BamHI and XhoI. For reporter assay, Lip of ect amine 2000 (Invitrogen Corp, CA, USA) was used to transfect cells with   $100\ \mathrm{ng}$   of pGL3- BDNF  wild, pGL3-  BDNF  mutant and miR-922 mimics, respectively. Renilla luciferase vector pRL-SV40   $(5\,\mathrm{\nsim)}$  was co-trans fec ted as a control for transfection ef ﬁ ciency.  

# ELISA of Serum BDNF Levels  

ELISA kit (Green Stone, Bern, Switzerland) was used to measure BDNF levels according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions. Concentrations of serum BDNF were calculated by mean absorbance of each sample at   $460~\mathrm{nm}$  .  

# Statistical Analysis  

Demographic data were compared using two-sample  $t\cdot$  -tests and chi-square  $(\chi^{2})$   test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the relationships between different genotypes and IS risk, severity and outcome. Luciferase activities and serum BDNF levels between different genotypes were compared using independent-sample    $t\cdot$  -test. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata/SE (V.12.0 for Windows; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) and two-tailed  $\mathrm{~P~}<\,0.05$  was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant.  

# Results  

# Demographic Characteristics of Patients and Control Subjects  

Table 1  shows the demographic characteristics of IS patients and controls. Signi ﬁ cantly higher proportion of drinking

  $(\mathrm{P}<0.001)$  , smoking   $(\mathrm{P}<0.001)$  ), suffering from diabetes

  $(\mathbf{P}=0.003)$  ) and hypertension   $\mathrm{P}<0.001\$  ) were observed in patient group compared with control group. As expected, these observations con ﬁ rmed that drinking, smoking, hypertension and diabetes were risk factors for IS. As compared with control group, a signi ﬁ cant higher serum triglycerides concentration was also observed in the patient group   $(\mathbf{P}=0.009)$  ).  

# Identi ﬁ cation of BDNF SNPs in   $\mathfrak{z}^{\prime}$  -UTR  

To identify candidate BDNF SNPs in  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR, NCBI single nucleotide polymorphism database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/snp ) was searched. The following searching parameters were used: Organism (Homo sapiens); Function Class (  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR); Global MAF (0.05 – 0.4); Validation Status (by-1000 Genomes). Finally, three BDNF SNPs were identiﬁ ed ( Table 2 ).

# Associations of BDNF rs7124442 with IS Risk, Severity, Outcome  

We then assessed genotype frequencies of these three  BDNF SNPs in 500 ischemic stroke patients and 520 healthy controls and further investigated their associations with IS severity and outcome in patient group. There were no signi ﬁ cant differences observed in the genotype distributions of the three SNPs between patients and controls before and after adjusting the risk factors including age, sex, smoking, drinking, diabetes, hypertension, total cholesterol, triglycerides. Moreover, when the rs7124442 was further analyzed under dominant and additive models, still no signi ﬁ cant difference was found between patients and controls ( Table 3 ). This suggested that BDNF  rs11030099, rs7124442 and rs11030100 were not risk factors for ischemic stroke. However, when we next investigated the associations of the three SNPs with IS severity and outcome, there was a signi ﬁ cant difference of rs7124442 distribution observed in mild and severe patient groups. After adjusted for age and sex, logistic regression analysis showed that patients harbored with rs7124442 TC genotype

had a milder initial stroke (Dominant model:  $\mathrm{OR}=0.45$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}\;=\;0.25–0.81$  ,   $\mathrm{~P~}=\ 0.015)$  ) ( Table 4 ), and also showed a better short-term recovery (Dominant model:   $\mathrm{OR}=0.39$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI=}0.24{-}0.68$  ,  $\mathbf{P}=0.003\$  ) ( Table 5 ).  

# miR-922 Binding Altered by rs7124442  

We next performed a bioinformatics analysis to determine whether this  BDNF  rs7124442 SNP could have miRNA binding sites. The results showed that rs7124442 polymorphism may potentially alter miR-922 binding to  BDNF  mRNA ( Figure 1A ). Then, a dual luciferase assay was conducted to con ﬁ rm this potential regulation. The results showed that cotransfection of hsa-miR-922 mimics with  BDNF    $3^{\prime}$  -UTR containing the mutated allele C changed luciferase activity when compared to co-transfection with  BDNF  3 ʹ -UTR containing the wild-type allele ( Figure 1B ).  BDNF  mRNA levels in IS patients were then examined. The results showed that patients carrying  $B D N F\,\mathrm{{rs}712444\,\mathrm{{TC}}}$   or CC genotype had an increased level of  BDNF  mRNA when compared to patients carrying TT genotype ( Figure 1C ). Next, we tested the patients ’  serum BDNF concentrations. Mean BDNF serum concentrations of   $21.53\pm6.05\ \mathrm{ng}/\mathrm{mL}$   in the rs7124442 TT group and  $25.06\pm3.27\,\mathrm{ng}/\mathrm{mL}$   in the rs7124442 TC/CC group were measured. Student ’ s    $t$  -test revealed signi ﬁ cantly higher BDNF protein concentrations in the TC/CC group compared to TT group   $(t=5.165$  ,  $d f\!=\!498$  ,  $P<0.001]$  ). Considering the BDNF  rs7124442 polymorphism was associated with IS severity and outcome; we then analyzed the serum BDNF concentrations in patients with different stroke severity and outcome. Mean BDNF serum concentrations of   $27.11\pm7.25$   $\mathrm{{ng/mL}}$   in mild stroke group and   $20.32\pm4.67\,\mathrm{ng}/\mathrm{mL}$   in severe stroke group were measured. Student ’ s  $t.$  -test revealed signi ﬁ - cantly higher BDNF protein concentrations in mild stroke group compared to severe stroke group   $\left(t=10.91\right.$  ,    $d f\!=498$  ,  $P<0.001\big>$  ). In addition, mean BDNF serum concentrations of

  $26.78\pm6.19~\mathrm{ng/mL}$   in IS improvement group and   $19.37\ \pm$   $5.81\ \mathrm{\ns/mL}$   in IS deterioration group were measured. Student ’ s    $t.$  -test revealed signi ﬁ cantly higher BDNF protein concentrations in IS improvement group compared to IS deterioration group   $\begin{array}{r}{t=13.68,}\end{array}$  ,  $d f\!=\!498$  ,  $P<0.001\$  ). These results showed some consistency with previous rs7124442 association analysis.  

# Discussion  

In this study, the relationships between  BDNF  rs7124442 polymorphism and IS risk and outcome were investigated in a Chinese Han population. We observed that drinking, smoking, hypertension and diabetes were all associated with an increased IS risk. We further found that  BDNF  rs7124442 C-carriers had a milder initial stroke and a better short-term

recovery. In addition, our data were  ﬁ rst to show that  BDNF rs7124442 polymorphism could alter the binding of miR-922 to positively regulate  BDNF  expression, thus providing a post-transcriptional mechanism for gene regulation.  

Previously, clinical studies have demonstrated that low circulating concentrations of BDNF are associated with poor long-term functional outcome,   as well as short-term functional outcome and mortality of ischemic stroke.   Genetic studies have revealed that  BDNF Val66Met (rs6265), the most well-studied  BDNF  polymorphism so far, is associated with several neurological disorders. The  BDNF  rs6265 polymorphism involves a G to A substitution at position 196 (G196A), which results in the conversion of valine to methionine in coding area.   Evidence suggests rs6265 is associated with cortical and hippo camp al plasticity, as well as brain morphology changes. , – 22   Clinical studies have also shown that this polymorphism is associated with motor recovery ,   in stroke patients. In addition, the less studied rs7124442 polymorphism is reported to affect acute mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury.  

Mounting evidence suggests that SNPs localize in  $3^{\prime}$  -UTRs may affect the binding of miRNAs to their target genes, causingpost-translational expression changes of target mRNAsand alteration of susceptibility to disease.   For example, previous studies showed that rs4143815 and rs4819388 SNPs in the  $3^{\prime}$  - UTR of B7-H1 and B7-H2 genes, respectively, contribute to development of gastric cancer. – 26   Our study  ﬁ rstly demonstrates the interactions between miR-922 and SNP in  BDNF  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR.  

There are some limitations needing to be considered. Our study only studied the short-term outcome of patients, and the contributions of the SNPs to the long-term recovery and functional outcomes need to be further studied. Our results should therefore be con ﬁ rmed in independent samples or samples from another ethnic population. Moreover, our  ﬁ ndings also need to be further veri ﬁ ed in future studies with larger sample sizes.  

# Conclusion  

In summary, our current study showed that the genetic variant of  BDNF  rs7124442 was associated with milder initial stroke severity, and also with a better short-term recovery after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, miR-922 could regulate SNP rs7124442, resulting in increased BDNF  expression in C-allele mutants. Thus,  BDNF rs7124442 might act as a protective factor for the outcome of patients with ischemic stroke.
