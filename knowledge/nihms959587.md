# Abstract  

The Histone De acetyl as e 9 (HDAC9) polymorphism rs2107595 is associated with an increased  risk for large vessel at hero sclerotic stroke (LVAS). In humans, there remains a need to better  understand this HDAC9 polymorphism’s contribution to large vessel stroke. In this pilot study, we  evaluated whether the HDAC9 polymorphism rs2107595 is associated with differences in  leukocyte gene expression in patients with LVAS. HDAC9 SNP rs2107595 was genotyped in 155  patients (43 LVAS and 112 vascular risk factor controls). RNA isolated from blood was processed  on whole genome micro arrays. Gene expression was compared between HDAC9 risk allele  positive and risk allele negative LVAS patients and controls. Functional analysis identified  canonical pathways and molecular functions associated with rs2107595 in LVAS. In HDAC9 SNP  rs2107595 risk allele positive LVAS patients there were 155 genes differential ly expressed  compared to risk allele negative patients (fold change >|1.2|,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05\big)$  ). The 155 genes separated the  risk allele positive and negative LVAS patients on a Principal Components Analysis. Pathways  associated with HDAC9 risk allele positive status involved IL6 signaling, cholesterol efflux, and  platelet aggregation. These preliminary data suggest an association with the HDAC9 rs2107595  risk allele and peripheral immune, lipid, and clotting systems in LVAS. Further study is required to  evaluate whether these differences are related to large vessel atherosclerosis and stroke risk.

# Introduction  

Large vessel atherosclerosis is an important cause of ischemic stroke. Understanding  genomic differences that place individuals at risk of large vessel stroke could aid in the  development of novel stroke prevention strategies. Histone De acetyl as e 9 (HDAC9) is a  

class IIa histone de acetyl as e located at  $7\mathrm{p}21^{1,\,2}$  . A GWAS study conducted by the  International Stroke Genetics Consortium and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium  2 demonstrated an association between HDAC9 and large vessel at hero sclerotic stroke 3 . The  A risk allele at HDAC9 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2107595, which displays  incomplete penetrance, increases odds for large vessel stroke 4–6 . However, the underlying  functional relationship of rs2107595 to LVAS remains unclear.  

HDAC9 regulates gene expression by removing acetyl groups from proteins that regulate  chromatin state 7 . Hypo-acetyl ation at gene promoters typically leads to transcriptional  repression by restricting accessibility of transcriptional machinery to chromatin .  Balancing acetyl ation/de acetyl ation plays a key role in disease states such as  atherosclerosis .  

HDAC9 is up regulated in human carotid and aortic at hero sclerotic plaques 4 . Cells that  express HDAC9 include monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, vascular endo the li al  cells, and smooth muscle cells 1 . Coronary artery disease patients exhibit significantly  elevated expression of HDAC9 in plasma 6 .  

HDAC9 deletion disrupts lipid homeostasis and genes involved in inflammation 10 . Loss of  HDAC9 increases Histone-3 acetyl ation at macrophage ABCA1, ABCG1, and PPAR $\cdot\gamma$    promoters, resulting in increased HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux and macrophage  polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype 10 . HDAC9 deficiency also reduces  at hero sclerotic lesion size in   $\mathrm{Awp}\mathrm{E}^{-/-}\mathrm{mice}^{1}$  .  

In humans, there remains a need to better understand how HDAC9 SNP rs2107595  contributes to LVAS. In this novel pilot study, we evaluated how HDAC9 SNP rs2107595  relates to blood cell gene expression in patients with LVAS and in vascular risk factor  controls (VRFC).  

# Methods  

# Study Subjects  

LVAS patients and VRFC were prospectively recruited from the University of California,  Davis from 2012-2014. The institutional review board approved the study protocol, and  written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Stroke diagnosis criteria are  available in the Supplementary Methods. VRFC had no clinical history of stroke or  cardiovascular disease, and no recent infection. Controls were of similar age, sex, and  vascular risk factor profile as stroke patients.  

# SNP Genotyping  

Blood collection and RNA/DNA isolation methods are available in Supplementary Methods.  The SNP rs2107595 was genotyped using the Single Tube TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay  per manufacturer protocol (Life Technologies Corporation, NY). PCR amplification was  performed using 50ng of gDNA with the Applied Biosystems-7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR  System. TaqMan Genotyper Software was used to plot  $\mathbf{R}_{\mathbf{n}}$   values based on fluorescence  signals from each sample and used to determine allele representation. Assays were  

performed in triplicate and included positive controls of two homozygotes and one  heterozygote on each replicate. Positive control DNA was obtained from the Coriell  Bio repository (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ). Genotype distribution  of rs2107595 did not significantly deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both LVAS  and control groups   $\mathrm{(p{>}0.05)}$  . Subjects exhibiting one or both of risk alleles were deemed  rs2107595 risk allele positive. Subjects exhibiting two non-risk alleles were deemed  rs2107595 risk allele negative.  

# Gene Expression Array Hybridization and Statistical Analysis  

RNA samples underwent two-cycle target labeling, and cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix  Human Transcript ome 2.0 Arrays per the manufacturer’s GeneChip protocol (Affymetrix,  Santa Clara, CA). These arrays cover all known protein coding genes (Affymetrix GeneChip  HTA Data Sheet). To minimize batch effect and technical variation, each batch contained  equal numbers of randomly allocated stroke and control patients.  

Raw gene expression data was normalized using Robust Multichip Averaging (RMA) and   $\log_{2}$   transformed as previously described 11 . Statistical analysis and principal components  analysis were performed using Partek Genomics Suite 6.6. After removing un annotated  transcripts, 33,007 probe sets were used for analysis. Gene expression of risk allele positive  LVAS patients was compared to risk allele negative LVAS patients. Similarly, gene  expression of risk allele positive VRFC patients was compared to risk allele negative VRFC  patients. Univariate analysis was performed to identify potential confounding variables  including age, sex, race, and vascular risk factors. Variables with  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05$   were then included  in the multivariate model. Probesets with a  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05$   and fold change ≥|1.2| were considered  significant, as previously described 12–15 . Functional pathways represented greater than  expected by chance (Fisher’s exact test) based on the differential ly expressed genes were  identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN, Redwood City, CA,  www.ingenuity.com ) and literature review.  

# Results  

# Patient Characteristics  

A total of 43 LVAS and 112 VRFC patients were included in this study. There were no  statistically significant differences in patient demographics including age, sex, vascular risk  factors, or smoking status between LVAS and VRFC groups (Table 1). Of 43 LVAS patients,  24 were rs2107595 risk allele positive and 19 risk allele negative. Of the 112 VRFC patients,  31 were rs2107595 risk allele positive and 81 risk allele negative. There were significantly  more rs2107595 risk allele positive LVAS patients   $(56\%)$   than rs2107595 risk allele positive  VRFC patients   $(28\%)$     $(\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.001$  , chi square). There were no significant differences between  rs2107595 risk allele positive and risk allele negative LVAS groups (Supplementary Table  1), nor were there significant differences between VRFC risk allele positive and negative  groups (Supplementary Table 2).  

# Differential ly Expressed Genes (DEG)  

In LVAS there were 155 DEG in rs2107595 risk allele positive compared to risk allele  negative patients (Supplementary Table 3). Of these,   $139(89.1\%)$   were up regulated and   $16(10.9\%)$   were down regulated in risk allele positive patients. A principal components  analysis plot of these 155 genes demonstrates separation of rs2107595 risk allele positive  and risk allele negative LVAS by gene expression (Figure 1). In VRFC there were 8 DEG in  rs2107595 risk allele positive compared to risk allele negative patients (Supplementary Table  4). The CHML (Cho roi de remi a-Like Protein) gene was shared by comparisons of risk allele  $+/-$   LVAS to risk allele  $+/-$  VRFC.  

# Functional Analysis  

Pathway analysis for the 155 genes associated with rs2107595 identified canonical pathways  involving IL6 signaling, ERK/MAPK signaling, LXR/RXR activation, and the role of  macrophages, fi br oblasts, and endo the li al cells in rheumatoid arthritis (Table 2). SNP  rs2107595 risk allele positive LVAS was associated with leukocyte recruitment, chronic  inflammation, immune response of macrophages, cholesterol efflux, and platelet aggregation  (Table 2). GMFG (Glial growth factor  $\gamma$  , FC: 1.24,  $\mathtt{p}{=}0.02.$  ) and LRP1 (Low-density  lipoprotein receptor related protein 1, FC: −1.23,  $\tt p{=}0.01$  ) are involved in endo the li al cell  function and ang io genesis  and were differential ly expressed in LVAS risk allele positive  patients.  

Literature review indicates the following genes have previously been associated with  atherosclerosis and were differential ly expressed in a pro-a the rogen ic manner between risk  allele positive and negative patients: CX3CR1, HCAR2, HMGB1, JUNB, LRP1, PDE3B,  PTGS1, S100A8, THBS1, TUBB2A, and VCAN. Of note were HMGB1 (High mobility  group box 1, FC: 1.20,  $\tt p{=}0.03.$  ) and THBS1 (Th rom bos pond in 1, FC: −1.25,  $\tt p{=}0.04)$  ).  

# Discussion  

The HDAC9 risk allele at rs2107595 was associated with differences in blood cell gene  expression in patients with LVAS. Risk allele positive LVAS patients had increased gene  expression involved in inflammation, lipid metabolism and platelet aggregation.  Mechanisms by which these changes occur require further study, but may include HDAC9  risk allele regulation of gene expression in leukocytes, or indirect regulation through  leukocyte interactions with endo the li al cells, or smooth muscle cells affected by the HDAC9  risk allele.  

In this study the risk allele does not seem to alter HDAC9 expression levels. However, a  previous study showed a significant increase of HDAC9 expression in both heterozygous  and homozygous patients with the risk allele 1 . Explanations for why the two studies differ  include: the 2015 study was performed on peripheral blood mono nuclear cells (monocytes,  lymphocytes), whereas the current study was performed on whole blood; and the current  study utilized controls matched for vascular risk factors (hypertension, hyper lipid emi a,  diabetes, and statin therapy) compared to the LVAS group, as opposed to healthy patients.  The different findings do raise the possibility that HDAC9 expression is regulated differently  in different leukocyte subsets. Thus, the risk allele, whether through changes in HDAC9  expression or not, may affect de acetyl as e activity differently than the non-risk allele, leading  to changes in gene expression. Indeed, both HDAC5 and HDAC7 alter gene expression  through de acetyl as e actions on gene promoters . The risk allele at rs2107595 may affect  HDAC9’s de acetyl as e activity and alter gene expression in leukocytes. Alternatively,  HDAC9 could affect endo the li al cells  and/or vascular smooth muscle cells, which could  alter leukocyte interactions with these cells and produce the differential blood cell gene  expression found in this study.  

The risk allele at rs210759 is not causative for LVAS. Many people that exhibit the risk  allele do not have stroke. It is possible that other factors interact with the HDAC9  polymorphism to contribute to stroke risk. The HDAC9 polymorphism displays incomplete  penetrance which may be influenced by polymorphic alleles at other loci, epigenetic  regulation, or environmental modifiers. This has been described in other diseases associated  with a genetic risk such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast cancer . This may explain why  in our study risk allele positive LVAS patients had differential gene expression involved in  lipid metabolism and inflammation while controls did not. Risk allele positive VRFC may  have compensatory mechanisms or a different genetic and environmental background.  Indeed, environmental factors such as diabetes and body mass index are known to influence  risk of coronary artery disease in patients with the rs2107595 risk allele 6 , and microbial  environment can influence HDAC9 de acetyl as e activity 24 . Specifically, statins have been  reported to affect histone acetyl ation 25 , though there were no differences of statin usage in  the risk allele positive and negative LVAS patients (Supplementary Table 1), and no  differences in statin usage in the risk allele positive and negative VRFC patients  (Supplementary Table 2). In addition, it is known that valproate is an HDAC inhibitor .  In our study, no patients were treated with valproate.  

# Inflammation  

HDAC9 SNP rs2107595 may increase risk of LVAS via its effect on leukocyte  $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{reg}}$   function.  HDAC9 de acetyl at es and down regulates FOXP3 (Forkhead Box P3). This impairs Tregulatory cell immunosuppression, resulting in increased inflammation which has been  implicated in atherosclerosis 28 . Down regulation of FOXP3 is associated with increased  HMGB1 (High Mobility Group Box 1) and IL6 (Interleukin 6) expression, which we  observed in rs2107595 risk allele positive LVAS patients (Table 1). This immune activation  may contribute to atherosclerosis and stroke.  

FOXP3 also decreases th rom bos pond in (THBS1) which was down regulated in rs2107595  risk allele positive patients. THBS1 plays a protective role in atherosclerosis, impeding  plaque maturation and rupture and suppressing the inflammatory response . THBS1 is  down regulated in patients with atherosclerosis, promoting plaque inflammation and  maturation . Thus the rs2107595 risk allele may contribute to LVAS via its effect on   $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{reg}}$    function and inflammation.  

# Lipid Metabolism  

ABCA7 and HCAR2 were both up regulated in LVAS HDAC9 risk allele positive patients.  ABCA7 is implicated in macrophage lipid efflux and clearance of apoptotic cells. It also  plays a role in T cell proliferation 32  and is an Alzheimer’s disease risk gene 33 . HCAR2  (hydroxyl-carboxylic receptor 2) is a niacin receptor gene that mediates niacin decrease of  Lipoprotein(a) 34 . Nicotinic acid action on HCAR2 causes atherosclerosis to regress in  humans and mice.  

LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1), is a signaling receptor that was  down regulated in LVAS risk allele positive patients. When expressed on adipocytes, it  protects against diet-induced atherosclerosis and modulates atherosclerosis by regulating  inflammation 35 . LRP1 regulates cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. This is important  as excessive accumulation leads to foam cell formation which are precursors of  atherosclerosis 36 . LRP1 also regulates plasma levels of blood coagulation factor VIII and  other factors affecting coagulation 37  which could predispose to stroke.  

Cal gran ul in S100A8 is a pro inflammatory mediator of atherosclerosis and was up regulated  in LVAS risk allele positive patients. It is a major component of neutrophils, is up regulated  in macrophages and foam cells, and influences leukocyte recruitment and inflammation by  binding TLR4 and/or the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) 38 . Increased  plasma levels of S100A8 predict cardiovascular events in humans, and deletion of this gene  partly protects Apoe  $-/-$   mice from atherosclerosis 39 . Stroke associated carotid plaques have  high levels of S100A8.  

# Platelet Aggregation  

Disabled-2 (DAB2) is an adapter protein that is up-regulated during mega kary o cy tic  differentiation of he ma top oie tic cells. It is abundantly expressed in platelets where it is a key  regulator of platelet signaling 40 . Dab2 is released from platelet granules and controls the  extent of clotting reaction, platelet-fibrinogen interactions and outside-in signaling 40 . DAB2  is required for platelet aggregation, fibrinogen uptake, and integrin  α IIb β 3 activation  stimulated by low concentrations of thrombin. As a result, bleeding time is prolonged and  thrombus formation is impaired Dab2 deficient mice 40 . Moreover, the combination of Arh  and Dab2 is responsible for the majority of adaptor function in LDLR endocytosis and  LDLR-mediated cholesterol homeostasis 41 . Thus, Dab2 could play a role in clotting and  atherosclerosis associated with large vessel stroke.  

PLCG2 (PLCgamma2) is tightly regulated to ensure efficient but limited platelet activation  at sites of vascular injury 42 . Gain of function mutations in PLCG2 cause platelet  hyperactivity and a pro thr ombo tic state 42 . Platelet activation and thrombin generation are  crucial steps in primary and secondary hemostasis. Th rom bos pond in-1 (TSP1) levels in  human blood correlated with monocyte-platelet aggregates and thrombin generation  indicating a pivotal role in regulating thrombosis 43 . Indeed, platelet-derived TSP1 modulates  arterial thrombosis in vivo. Young patients with high cardiovascular risk and atherosclerosis  have high levels of th rom bos pond in-1 platelet microp articles. Th rom bos pond in-1 levels  correlate with carotid at hero sclerotic plaque size and irregularity 44 ; and th rom bos pond in-1  levels immediately after stroke predict six-month mortality and morbidity. Finally, TLN1  (talin 1) plays a role in  α IIb β 3 in activation in pro coagulant platelets 45  and thus also plays a  role in coagulation that could be crucial for outcomes in ischemic large vessel stroke.  

# Limitations  

This is a novel pilot study of human stroke showing a relationship between an HDAC9  polymorphism and whole genome gene expression differences. Sample size was small, thus  evaluation in larger cohorts is warranted to confirm findings. There was no significant  difference in phenotype between the few LVAS patients who were homozygous in  comparison to LVAS patients who were heterozygous for the risk allele. Similarly, there was  no significant difference in phenotype between the few VRFC who were homozygous in  comparison to VRFC who were heterozygous for the risk allele. Due to the limited number  of homozygous subjects   $\mathrm{{(n{=}4})}$  ), we were unable to analyze gene expression differences  between homozygous and heterozygous subjects in the LVAS and VRFC groups. Future  studies are needed to assess the possibility of an allelic dosage effect on gene expression.  Previous studies have shown that the risk allele at rs2107595 associates only with LVAS, and  not with any other stroke subtypes. However, future studies could utilize stroke patients  without LVAS as controls in order to specifically assess the risk allele’s pro-a the rogen ic  effects in comparison to the risk allele’s pro-stroke effects.  

Additional studies are needed to assess the relationship between leukocytes, endo the li al  cells, and smooth muscle cells with the risk allele. We were unable to determine whether  observed changes in leukocyte gene expression relate to HDAC9 risk allele regulation in  leukocytes, or an indirect effect of leukocytes interaction with endothelium or vascular  smooth muscles cells affected by HDAC9 risk allele. We unfortunately do not have data  sufficiently detailed to evaluate whether infarction of the insula or other particular brain  location may affect gene expression. This will be important to consider in future studies  given potential sympathetic effects on the spleen and peripheral cells.  

While HDAC9 risk allele positivity is associated with LVAS, additional genetic or  environmental factors may be required to result in stroke. While not every gene has the same  pattern of expression across LVAS patients, certain pathways are consistently over  represented in these patients. Thus, RAP patients consistently over express genes involved in  IL6 signaling, leukocyte recruitment, chronic inflammation, cholesterol efflux, and platelet  aggregation. However, whether the identified gene genes and pathways directly increase  stroke risk remains unclear. Experimental rodent stroke data support the importance of  HDACs in stroke 46–48  and the need for further studies to evaluate the role of HDAC9 in  stroke.
