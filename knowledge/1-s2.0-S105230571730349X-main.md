Background:  The association of  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus single nucleotide polymorphisms with arterial ischemic stroke in adults was demonstrated in many studies, but there are no studies in pediatric arterial ischemic stroke patients. We investigated whether the   $9\mathrm{p}21.3$  rial ischemic stroke risk in children.  Methods:  The study group consisted of 335 individuals: 80 children with arterial ischemic stroke, their biological parents   $(\mathsf{n}=122)$  ), and 133 children (age and sex matched) without any symptoms of arterial ischemic stroke as a control group. The rs10757278 polymorphism was genotyped using the TaqMan  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems). Two different study design models were used: family-based association test (transmissiond is equilibrium test) and case-control model.  Results:  There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in the distribution of genotypes and alleles of the rs10757278 polymorphism between groups of children with arterial ischemic stroke and controls. The frequency of both transmitted alleles in transmission-d is equilibrium test analysis was identical   $(50\%)$  . The A allele carrier state (  $\mathrm{FA+AC}$   genotype) was more frequent in arterial ischemic stroke children with hemi pares is than in patients without this symptom   $(94.5\%$   versus  $68.0\%$  ,  $P=.004\$  ).  Conclusions:  There is no evidence to consider the  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus polymorphism as a risk factor for childhood arterial ischemic stroke.

# Introduction  

Pediatric arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) most often has a multi factorial and multigenic nature. The main known causes of childhood stroke are cerebral arte rio p athies, heart diseases, chronic and acute systemic conditions, traumas, infections, metabolic and mitochondrial disorders, as well as various other factors.   It is generally accepted that ischemic stroke in children may also result from hyper coagulation, resulting from endo the li al dysfunction and various disorders of the blood coagulation cascade components. Although atherosclerosis is the major cause of cerebro vascular insufficiency in ischemic stroke of adults, its participation in the conditioning of pediatric stroke is rather marginal and limited only to rare monogenic diseases such as familial hypercholesterolemia. Some of the classical risk factors for ischemic stroke of adults, such as hypercholesterolemia or hypertension, however, are relatively common in children.   Although many children have several potential risk factors rather than one causative factor, about   $50\%$   of all cases of pediatric stroke are crypto geni c.  

Genetic basis of pediatric AIS is not known sufficiently, in contrast to ischemic stroke of adults. Although many genetic risk factors of pediatric AIS were identiﬁed, heterogeneity and crypto geni c nature of the disease may incline to believe that there are some additional factors inﬂuencing the AIS phenotype in a way independent of known risk factors. Polymorphisms of the  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus can certainly be considered as such factors. The  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$  locus was originally found to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) by independent genomewide association studies.   Afterwards, the association of  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with CAD and myocardial infarction was conﬁrmed in many populations of European and Asiatic origin.   Many candidate gene studies have also demonstrated an association between polymorphisms of  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus and AIS; however, some of them yielded opposite results. The overall effect size of the  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   risk allele for AIS is rather weaker than that observed for CAD.  

The  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus (53kB in section 21 of the short arm of the 9 chromosome) contains numerous strongly linked SNPs   $(r^{2}>.8)$  .   The SNPs associated with CAD and AIS are located within a gene desert ﬂanked by adjacent cell cycle-regulating genes:  CDKN2A ,  CDKN2B ,  ANRIL  and MTAP .   CDKN2A  gene (cyclic dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) encodes p16INK4A (an inhibitor of CDK4) and p19ARF (a p53-regulatory protein, which binds MDM2). CDKN2B  encodes another CDK inhibitory protein, namely p15INK4B (an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6).  ANRIL  (antisense RNA in the INK4 locus) is a large non-proteincoding gene, regulating expression of  CDKN2A  and CDKN2B,  and  MTAP,  a tumor suppressor gene, encoding ubiquitously expressed S-methyl $.5^{\prime}$  -th io adenosine phosphorylase, which catalyzes the polyamine biosynthesis.  

The  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus is the second densest gene desert for predicted enhancers in the human genome, with 33 identiﬁed enhancers.   One of the SNPs (rs10757278, c.22114477  $\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{G}$  ) is located within binding site for STAT1, a transcription factor activated by interferon  $\upgamma.$   The risk allele (G) disrupts binding of STAT1, altering the cellular response to in amma tion, ang io genesis, and at hero genesis. There are conﬂicting results about an inﬂuence of  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$  polymorphisms on expression of neighboring genes. Some reports found that  CDKN2A  and  CDKN2B  are both jointly decreased with  ANRIL ,   but decrease of  CDKN2A with increase of  CDKN2B  expression has also been reported.   There is evidence that these polymorphisms, through  ANRIL ,  CDKN2A , and  CDKN2B , modulate the expression of many other genes inﬂuencing cell cycle, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and many other processes in cardiovascular system.  

To date, there are no studies analyzing the 9p21.3 locus in the context of pediatric stroke. Lack of association studies of the  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus polymorphisms in pediatric AIS has prompted us to undertake the present study. We investigated whether the  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus polymorphism, namely rs10757278, is associated with the AIS risk in children, using two different methods: family-based association test and case-control model.  

# Methods  

# Participants  

The study group consisted of 335 individuals, including 80 children with ischemic stroke, their biological parents  $(\mathsf{n}=122)$  ), and 133 children without any symptoms of AIS as a control group. There were 44 males and 36 females in the patients group, and the age at the acute phase of stroke ranged from 6 months to 18 years (mean:  $8.79\pm5.56)$  ). Participants were recruited from the Department of Neuro pediatrics at the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice   $\left(\mathsf{n}=40\right)$  , the Department of Developmental Neurology at the Medical University of Gdansk   $(\mathsf{n}=18)$  ), the Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Neurology, Medical College at the Jagiellonian University   $(\mathsf{n}=12)$  ), and the Department of Neurology at the Polish Mother’s Memorial Hospital in Lodz   $(\mathsf{n}=10)$  ). Neurologic examinations and neuro imaging were performed at least twice (at the acute phase and during follow-up). The stroke subtypes were evaluated using the Oxfordshire class i cation.  

The control group was age- and sex-matched (77 males, 56 females, ages ranged from 4 months to 18 years, mean:  $7.82\pm5.21)$  ). One hundred thirty-one control children were recruited in Katowice and 2 in Gdansk. These children had no signs of AIS or other vascular diseases.  

The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, and written consents were submitted by the parents of the patients.  

Genetic Analyses  

Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral lymphocytes using the MasterPure genomic DNA pur i cation kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). The rs10757278 polymorphism of the 9p21.3 locus was genotyped using the TaqMan  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The polymerase chain reaction amp li cation was performed according to the manufacturer’s speciﬁcations. Genotyping was performed using the 7300 RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Correctness of genotyping was checked by re-genotyping   $15\%$   of the samples. Repeatability of results was   $100\%$  .  

# Statistical Analyses  

The role of rs10757278 polymorphism in the AIS has been tested by two independent methods: family-based association test—transmission-d is equilibrium test (TDT) and classical case-control model. TDT analysis was conducted only in informative trios of AIS patient and its parents. Informative trios are families with at least one heterozygous parent. Only in such cases it was possible to deduce which allele had been transmitted from a parent to the child. Transmission of a particular allele from the heterozygous parents to an offspring is expected to be approximately   $50\%,$  , when there is no association of the allele and the disease. If the allele is associated with an increased risk of the disease, an excess transmission to the offspring is expected. The observed frequencies of transmitted alleles were compared with the expected frequencies by the means of the  $\chi^{2}$    test. Similarly the  $\chi^{2}$    test was used in the case-control model. Odds ratios (OR) as well as their  $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for rs10757278 genotypes were computed using multivariate regression model analysis. The  Statistica 10.0  software (STATSOFT, Tulsa, OK, USA) was used in all above analyses. The effective sample size and statistical power of association analyzes were computed using Epi Info™7.1.1.0 developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA).  

# Results  

# Clinical Characteristics  

Clinical characteristics of stroke children are shown in the  Table 1 . The main symptoms of the onset of stroke were cranial nerve VII paresis   $(71.3\%)$  ), hemiparesis   $(68.8\%)$  ), consciousness disturbances   $(50.0\%)$  , and aphasia  $(46.3\%)$  . The most frequent were incidents of partial anterior circulation infarct   $(40.0\%)$  , next were lacunar infarcts   $(23.1\%).$  , total anterior circulation infarcts (21.5), and posterior circulation infarcts   $(15.4\%)$  ). The most fre- quent post-stroke symptoms diagnosed during followup examination were hemi pares is   $(65.0\%)$  , epilepsy and

other motor disabilities   $(31.3\%)$  , and decrease of intellectual functioning   $(16.3\%)$  ).  

# Analysis of rs10757278 Polymorphism and Pediatric AIS Risk  

Genotype frequencies were compatible with the HardyWeinberg equilibrium in both groups (  $P=.39$   in AIS group,  $P=.79$   in control children). Data from genotyping the rs10757278 polymorphism are shown in the  Table 2 . We did not ﬁnd any statistically signiﬁcant differences in the distribution of genotypes and alleles of the rs10757278 polymorphism between groups of children with AIS and controls. There is, however, tendency to more frequent occurrence of the AA genotype, A allele carrier state  $(\mathrm{AA}+\mathrm{AC}$   genotypes), as well as A allele, in the patients group.  

Among 50 full families qualiﬁed to the TDT analysis (both parents and AIS child), 40 trios were informative. The number of both transmitted alleles (A and G) was identical   $\mathrm{{(n=27,}}$  ,   $50\%$  ). The observed frequencies for both alleles did not differ sign i cant ly from expected ( Table 3 ).  

# rs10757278 and Clinical Phenotype  

Genotype variants of the rs10757278 polymorphism were associated with some symptoms of the onset of stroke, such as the presence of hemi pares is ( Table 4 ) and nerve VII paresis ( Table 5 ). The A allele carrier state (  $\mathrm{kA}+\mathrm{AC}$

The power of test was   $87\%$  , with a  $95\%$  two-sided conﬁdence level (CL). The A allele frequency was also higher in patients with hemi pares is   $\left(P=.015\right)$  ). Estimated power was   $66\%$     $95\%$   CL). The A allele carrier state was also associated with the presence of the nerve

VII paresis   $\left(P=.043\right)$  , but the power of this test was relatively low (  $48\%$  ,   $95\%$   CL).  

# Discussion  

In our present study we investigated whether the 9p21.3 locus polymorphism, rs10757278, is associated with pediatric AIS in Polish AIS patients. We did not ﬁnd any statistically signiﬁcant differences between cases and controls in allele and genotype frequencies. Also TDT model did not identify preferentially transmitted allele of the rs10757278 polymorphism. The A allele carrier state of the rs10757278 polymorphism was, however, associated with some symptoms of the onset of stroke, such as the presence of hemi pares is.  

Our work is the ﬁrst that analyzed the association of the  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus polymorphism with AIS in children. In adults, two meta-analyses analyzing the risk of AIS in

relation to the  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   risk allele were performed to date, and their results indicate that the effect size is dependent on ethnicity, stroke subtype, and the source of controls. Sign i cant ly increased risks were found in East Asians  $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.17.$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.05-1.32,    $P<10^{-4},$  , recessive model) and Caucasians   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.26,$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.19-1.31,  $P<10^{-5}.$  , recessive model).   No signiﬁcant associations were found among African–Americans in recessive and dominant models. Restriction of an analysis to a large artery strokes increased the risk size associated with the presence of the   $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   risk allele.   The effect for large artery stroke was the strongest in the recessive model (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.25,$  ,  $95\%$  CI: 1.17-1.29,  $P<10^{-5}$  ). 13   The risk of ischemic stroke was also higher in the case of studies with hospital-based controls   $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.45,$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.18-1.99,    $P=.0008,$  , recessive model) than in studies with population-based controls  $(\mathrm{OR}=1.22$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.17-1.31,  $P<10^{-5},$  , recessive model). 13  

Surprisingly, the A allele associated with symptoms of the onset of stroke (e.g., hemi pares is) in our study has protective values of ORs in case-control studies on CAD and ischemic stroke in adults.   Nevertheless, the result obtained in our study seems not to be accidental due to the power value and the strength of association   $(87\%,$   $95\%$   CL;  $P=.004\$  ). An association of the A allele with hemiparesis is difficult to interpret, primarily because of lack of references in the literature about role of the  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus in pediatric AIS conditioning. Relatively small group of pediatric AIS patients limits reliability of results of the present study. Such number of included cases, however, is limited by the frequency of AIS in children (2-6/ 100,000). It is possible that a signiﬁcant increase in sample size would change the outcome of research. Regardless, knowledge of the role of polymorphism locus 9p21.3 in conditioning cardiovascular diseases, including pediatric AIS, requires additional costly and complex research. At the moment, however, there is no conclusive evidence to consider the  $9\mathrm{p}21.3$   locus polymorphisms as a risk factors for childhood AIS.
