Abstract:  The SNP rs11628722 in the  SERPINA9  gene was previously associated with incident ischemic stroke  in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Centerin, the protein encoded by  SERPINA9 , is involved  in maturation and maintenance of naïve B cells, which play a role in at hero genesis. We investigated whether 21  tag SNPs in the  SERPINA9  gene are associated with features of carotid artery at hero sclerotic plaque measured by  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Carotid MRI data were obtained from 1,282 European Americans and 341 Af­ rican Americans of the ARIC Carotid MRI study, which recruited participants from ARIC by a stratified sampling plan  that over-sampled participants with carotid intima-media thickening. Five MRI measures, focused on carotid wall  volume, wall thickness, and lipid core, were analyzed. Genetic associations between the MRI measurements and  each of the 21 SNPs were analyzed in linear regression models with adjustment for sample weights and traditional  risk factors. Rs11628722 was tested  a priori . In African Americans, rs11628722 was significantly associated with  carotid wall volume   $\mathsf{\Delta}^{\mathsf{\prime}}{\mathsf{p}}<0.05$  ). Among the other 20 SNPs, adjusted for multiple testing, rs4905204, which encodes  an Ala to Val amino acid change, was significantly associated with maximum wall thickness   $(\mathsf{p}<0.000625$  ) and  suggestively associated with total wall volume   $(\mathsf{p}<0.0026)$  ) in European Americans. In conclusion, SNPs in the  SERPINA9  gene showed race-specific associations with characteristics of carotid at hero sclerotic plaques. Replica­ tions in other populations are needed to validate findings of this study and to establish the  SERPINA9  gene as a  candidate in the etiology of carotid atherosclerosis.

# Introduction  

Vulnerable at hero sclerotic plaques are plaques  that have a high risk to rupture and conse­ quently cause cardiovascular complications  such as myocardial infarction or stroke [1].  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of athero­ sclerosis allows direct visualization of diseased  artery walls and characterization of plaque  composition and morphology [1, 2], providing  useful information for identifying vulnerable  plaques. For example, in prospective studies,  MRI identified the following plaque character is­ tics that predicted symptoms of cerebro vas cu­ lar events: presence of a thin or ruptured fibrous  cap, intra plaque hemorrhage, larger mean  intra plaque hemorrhage area, larger maximum  percentage lipid-rich/necrotic core, and larger  maximum wall thickness [3, 4].  

In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities  (ARIC) study, the SNP rs11628722 in the  SERPINA9  gene, which results in an amino acid  change from Val to Ala, was significantly associ­ ated with incident ischemic stroke in both  African Americans and European Americans [5].  

The hazard rate ratio of stroke associated with  each copy of at-risk allele was 1.32 in European  Americans and 1.27 in African Americans after  adjusting for traditional risk factors   $(\mathsf{p}<0.05)$  )  [5]. The  SERPINA9  gene encodes a protein  named SERPINA9, also known as centerin or  GCET1 (germinal center (GC) B-cell-expressed  transcript 1) [6, 7]. Centerin is involved in matu­ ration and maintenance of naïve B cells [6].  Since B cells are involved in at hero genesis [8,  9], it is possible that the association of the  SERPINA9  gene variant and stroke is mediated  via cerebro vascular atherosclerosis. In this  study,  we  investigated  the  associations  between  SERPINA9  gene variants, including  rs11628722, and characteristics of carotid  at hero sclerotic plaques measured by MRI in  1,623 participants from the ARIC Carotid MRI  study.  

# Materials and methods  

# Population  

The ARIC study is a prospective investigation of  atherosclerosis and its clinical events among  15,792 African American and European American adults aged 45 to 64 years at recruitment  in 1987 through 1989, from Forsyth County,  North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; suburbs  of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington  County, Maryland [10]. The Jackson sample  comprised African Americans only; the other  three samples represented the ethnic mix of  their communities. The ARIC Carotid MRI study  recruited 2,066 ARIC participants to undergo  an examination in 2004-2005. A stratified sam­ pling plan was used to over-sample participants  with carotid intima-media thickening on previ­ ous ultrasound exams. The goal was to recruit  1,200 participants with thick carotid artery  walls   $(>85^{\mathrm{th}}$   percentile intima-media thickness  (IMT)) at their last ultrasound examination and  800 participants randomly sampled from the  remainder of the carotid IMT distribution. The  carotid IMT cutpoint was field center-specific  based on the IMT distribution of that site.  Participants who met the following criteria were  excluded: 1) race groups other than African  American or European American; 2) missing  IMT measurements at their most recent exami­ nation in the 1990s; 3) standard contra indica­ tions to the MRI exam or to the contrast agent;  and 4) carotid re vascular iz ation on either side  for the low IMT group or on the side selected for  imaging for the high IMT group. This study was  approved by the institutional review board of  corresponding centers and all participants pro­ vided informed consent.  

# Clinical examination and laboratory measure­ ments  

Questionnaires and in-person interviews were  used to obtain information on medical history,  prescription medication use, and lifestyle risk  factors. Cigarette-smoking status was catego­ rized as current, former, or never. Seated, rest­ ing blood pressure was measured three times  with a random-zero sph yg moma no meter and  the mean of last two measurements was used.  Hypertension was defined as systolic blood  pressure  $\geq140\ {\mathsf{m m}}\ {\mathsf{H g}}$  , diastolic blood pres­ sure   $\geq90\ \mathsf{m m}\ \mathsf{H g},$  , or use of anti hypertensive  medications during the previous 2 weeks.  Diabetes was defined as a fasting glucose level   $\geq126\,\mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{d L}$  , a non-fasting glucose level  $\geq200$    mg/dL, or a history of or treatment for diabetes.  Body mass index (BMI;   $\mathsf{k g}/\mathsf{m}^{2})$  ) was calculated  using measured weight and height. Total and  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol s  were assayed using conventional techniques.  

# MRI protocol  

Contrast enhanced MRI exams, guided by a  standard protocol, were performed on a   $\tt1.5~T$    whole body scanner (Excite platform, GE  Medical Systems, Symphony with Maestro upgrade, or Siemens Medical Solutions) equipped  with a bilateral 4-element phased array carotid  coil (Machnet, the Netherlands). A 3-dimen­ sional time-of-flight MR angiogram (MRA) was  acquired through both extra cranial carotid  bifurcations. Black blood MRI (BBMRI) images  of the thickest 1.6 cm segment were then  acquired through the carotid bifurcation known  to have a thicker maximum wall by the most  recent ultrasound study or the contra lateral  carotid bifurcation wall that appeared thicker  on the MRA to the technologist, using a cardi­ ac-gated, two-dimensional double inversion  recovery fast spin echo sequence with the  inversion time set to suppress the signal from  flowing blood.  

Sixteen transverse T1-weighted, fat-suppress­ ing BBMRI slices (acquired resolution,   $0.51~\times$     $0.58\times2~\mathsf{m m}^{3}$  ; total longitudinal coverage, 3.2  cm), centered at the thickest part of the inter­ nal or common carotid artery wall, were acquired 5 minutes after intravenous injection of  gad odi amide (Omniscan, GE Amersham), 0.1  mmol/kg body weight, with a power injector.  

# Image analysis  

Eight readers were trained to interpret the MRI  images using specialized software (VesselMASS, Leiden University Medical Center,  Netherlands). The readers were blinded to the  characteristics of the study population. All  exams were assigned quality scores by the  readers based on quality of image and protocol  adherence, and exams that failed were not ana­ lyzed. Contours were drawn by each reader to  delineate the lumen, outer wall, lipid core, and  calcification. The fibrous cap contour was auto­ matically generated to approximate the lumen  and lipid core contours. Only eight slices cen­ tering around the thickest part of the plaque  with matching pre contrast and post contrast  images were analyzed.  

Using custom analysis software, vessel walls  were divided into 12 radial segments and mean  minimum and maximum thickness values were  generated for each segment. The fibrous cap  was divided into radial segments at   $\mathtt{15^{\circ}}$   incre­ ments, with mean minimum and maximum  thicknesses generated for each segment. Area  measurements were calculated for the lipid  core and calcification contours. Volumetric  data were computed by integrating area mea­ surements over all slices examined.  

To assess the reliability of MRI measures, 130  scans were re-read by the same or a different  reader and 52 participants were re-scanned  within two months. Reliability of lipid core and  cap measurements was based on persons with  lipid core: 40 repeat readings and 14 repeat  scans. We included in this study four measures  for carotid artery wall thickness and one mea­ sure for lipid core area that have acceptable  consistency and reliability coefficients. The reli­ ability coefficients for repeat readings and  repeat scans of the measures are as follows:  total wall volume (0.76, 0.79), maximum wall  thickness (0.82, 0.77), and maximum lipid core  area (0.72, 0.66) [11].  

Genotyping  

The SNP rs11628722 was genotyped by using  PCR-based amplification of genomic DNA fol­ lowed by an allele specific oli go nucleotide liga­ tion assay as previously described [5]. The  other 20 SNPs in  SERPINA9  were tagSNPs sup­ plemented by non synonymous SNPs with a  minor allele frequency   $({\mathsf{M A F}})\,>\,0.05$  . The tag­ SNPs were selected based on genotype data  from the HapMap European (CEU) and Yoruban  (YRI) populations. The SNPs were selected in a  race specific manner using Haploview’s imple­ mentation of Tagger’s multi-marker algorithm  [12] at an  $\mathsf{r}^{2}\ge0.8$  ,  $L0D\geq2$  , and  ${\mathsf{M A F}}\geq0.05$  . All  tagSNPs selected for the CEU population were  included in the SNP panel. TagSNPs that were  not in blocks, or only tagged themselves in the  YRI population were not included. A custom  designed iSelect Infinium BeadChip with 7,600  bead types was used to generate the genotype  data by Illumina’s FastTrack Genoyping Services  (San Diego, CA). SNPs that were mono m orphic  or had missing data  $>20\%$   were excluded. For  SERPINA9 , 23 SNPs were initially selected for  genotyping and valid genotype data were  obtained for 20 SNPs. For the 20 SNPs, an  average concordance rate of   $99.3\%$   was achieved among 99-101 known replicate samples.  

# Statistical analysis  

We excluded those not consenting to use of  DNA   $(\mathsf{n}\!\!=\!\!8)$  ), missing crucial MRI data   $(\mathsf{n}\!\!=\!\!357)$  ),  missing SNP data   $\mathsf{(n{=}50)}$  ), or American Africans  not from the Jackson center   $\mathsf{\Gamma}(\mathsf{n}\!\!=\!\!28)$  , resulting  1,623 for this study. Since the samples were  collected by stratified random sampling, we  used methods suitable for this sampling  scheme in all the analyses. Specifically, we first  calculated the sample fractions based on the  pool actually screened for participation in the  eight strata (4 communities by 2 IMT groups),  then defined sample weights as the inverse of  the sampling fractions, and finally used these  weights to adjust the variance and confidence  interval estimates of any quantity of interest. All  the analyses using sample weights were car­ ried out by SUDAAN (Research Triangle Park,  NC).  

For each SNP, the weighted genotype frequen­ cies were estimated by SUDAAN CROSSTAB  using sampling weights. Given the estimated  genotype frequencies and the corresponding  covariance matrix, Hardy-Weinberg (HW) equi­ librium was tested using an asymptotic distri­ bution of the tests statistics, which is estimat­ ed by the delta method. Departure from HW  equilibrium was evaluated in both race groups  but the results in African Americans should be  interpreted with caution because population  admixture in African Americans can result in

deviation of genotype frequencies from HW  equilibrium [13, 14]. Significant threshold for  HW test was based on  $\mathsf{p}<0.002$  , accounted for  multiple testing by Bonferroni correction (ie, 21  SNPs).  

All genetic association analyses were assessed  by linear regression in African Americans and  European Americans separately and weighted  by sampling fractions in SUDAAN. The SNP gen­ otypes were coded as categorical variables and  all three genotypes for one SNP were analyzed  with a 2 degree of freedom test. If there were  less than 10 observations in one homozygote  group, we combined it with the heterozygote  group. Two sets of covariate adjustments, basic  and multivariate, were performed. The basic  adjustment included age, gender, and center  as covariates. The center variable was not  needed for analyses within African Americans  because they were all from the Jackson center.  The multivariate model additionally adjusted  for total cholesterol, BMI, current and former  smoking, diabetes, and hypertension.  

The SNP rs11628722 was tested  a priori  given  its previously reported association with stroke  in the ARIC cohort. Therefore, a   $\mathsf{p}<0.05$   was  used to judge significant associations between  this SNP and the carotid MRI measurements.  For the other 20 SNPs, we examined the extent  of linkage d is equilibrium (LD) among them  ( Figure 1 ) to determine the need for correction  for multiple comparisons. Because these SNPs  were selected to be TagSNPs, the extent of LD  is relatively low, with only 5 SNPs in African  Americans and 7 in European Americans hav­ ing   $\mathsf{r}^{2}>0.60$   ( Figure 1 ). At phenotype level, the  correlations were high among the four wall  thickness measures (0.71-0.99 in both race  groups) and moderate between the wall thick­ ness measures and maximum lipid core area  (0.54-0.86 in both race groups). Therefore, the  five measures were counted as two indepen­ dent tests. Using a Bonferroni correction for the  number of hypothesis tests, for the 20 SNPs we  used a   $\mathsf{p}\,<\,0.000625$   (ie,   $0.05/(20^{*}2^{*}2)$   as  the criterion for significant associations and a 
  $\mathsf{p}\,<\,0.0026$   (ie,   $0.2/(20^{*}2^{*}2)_{,}$  ) for suggestive  associations. In addition, genetic associations  were not tested for maximum lipid core area in  African Americans due to limited participants  with presence of lipid core   $(\mathsf{n}<100)$  ).  

In a sensitivity analysis in a subset of 300  African Americans for whom percentage of  African ancestry was estimated in an ancillary  study [15], we repeated the analyses for signifi­ cant associations with additional adjustment  for the percentage of African ancestry.

ences were observed for all four carotid artery  wall thickness measures and maximum lipid  core area.  

Information on the 21  SERPINA9  SNPs are pre­ sented in  Table 3 . According to the   $\mathsf{p}<0.002$    criterion, genotype distribution for rs4905204  in European Americans was not in accordance  with HW equilibrium expectations. Among the  21 SNPs, the following code for amino acid  changes in the  SERPINA9  gene: rs11628722,  rs12879019, rs28583900, rs28618118, and  rs4905204. Allele frequency for rs11628722,  the prioritized SNP, was disparate between  European Americans and African Americans  with opposite minor alleles between the two  groups. This discrepancy is also observed  between samples of European and African  ancestries in the HapMap data (CEU: 0.85, YRI:  0.35).  

Among the five carotid MRI measures,  rs11628722 was associated with total wall vol­ ume in African Americans ( Table 4 ). The G allele  of rs11628722 appeared to have a recessive  effect in that G homozygotes had significantly  greater total wall volume than AA and AG groups  ( Table 4 ). There were no significant associa­ tions between rs11628722 and the carotid  MRI measures in European Americans (p >  0.05, data not shown).  

Among the other 20  SERPINA9  SNPs, accord­ ing to the criteria for significant and suggestive  associations after correcting for multiple test­ ing, rs4905204 in European Americans was  significantly associated with two maximum wall  thickness measures in multivariate adjustment  and suggestively associated with total wall vol­ ume (adjusted) in the multivariate adjustment  model ( Table 5 ). The minor allele homozygote  AA appeared to have a negative association  with the wall thickness and volume measures  compared to AG and GG groups ( Table 5 ). In  African Americans, this SNP was rarer and  there were no AA homozygotes, thus preventing  replication of the associations in African  Americans. There were no other associations

# Discussion  

This cross-sectional study, conducted to followup previously reported associations between  SERPINA9  rs11628722 and stroke in the ARIC  Study, investigated the association between  MRI-measured characteristics of carotid ath­ ero sclerosis and 21  SERPINA9  SNPs in the  ARIC Carotid MRI study. In African Americans,  the G allele of rs11628722 that was associat­ ed with increased risk of stroke, was signifi­ cantly associated with increased total wall vol­ ume   $\mathsf{\Delta}^{\mathsf{\prime}}{\mathsf{p}}<0.05,$  ). This SNP was not significantly  associated with any measures of carotid artery  at hero sclerotic plaques in European Americans.  Among the other 20 SNPs for which adjustment  for multiple testing was considered, the SNP  rs4905204, which encodes a Ala to Val amino  acid change, was significantly associated with  maximum wall thickness measures (p <

SERPINA9 is a member of a large serpins (ser­ ine protease inhibitors) family consisting of at  least 16 clade subfamilies with divergent func­ tions [16]. SERPINA9 belongs to the clade A  subfamily and is located on chromosome  14q32 [17]. Two other members of the clade A,  SERPINA8 (angiotensin o gen) and SERPINA10  (protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor), have  been associated with hypertension and venous  thr ombo embo li c disease, respectively [7].  Northern blot and gene expression analyses of  human tissues showed that SERPINA9 was  detected in immune system including lymph  nodes [6] (www.genecards.org). In lymph  nodes, transcription of centerin was highly  expressed in GC B-cells and was up-regulated  by CD40 signaling, which is fundamental for GC  formation [6]. Therefore, it was speculated that  centerin plays an important role in maturation  and maintenance of naïve B cells [6]. Studies of  transgenic mice given s ple nec to my or bone  marrow transplantation showed that the  involvement of B cells plays a protective role  during at hero genesis [8, 9]. A recent report in  the ARIC Carotid MRI study showed that blood  cell activation is associated with the morpholo­ gy of carotid at hero sclerotic plaques [18]. While  the mechanisms underlying the association  between the  SERPINA9  gene variants and  carotid artery atherosclerosis are unknown, it is  possible that the association is mediated via  the B cell pathway.  

The G allele of rs11628722 was previously  associated with increased risk of stroke in ARIC  [5]. We observed a positive association of the  GG homo zy gos it y with total wall volume. This  finding suggests that this allele might act  through increased plaque burden to increase  the risk of stroke, as larger maximum wall thick­ ness, an index of plaque burden, similarly pre­ dicts symptoms of cerebro vascular events [3].  We searched the database of published  genome-wide association studies (www.gwas­ central.org) for the two associated SNPs  (rs11628722 and rs4905204) with regard to  their associations with atherosclerosis- or  inflammation-related phenotypes. We found  that rs11628722 was nominally associated  with asthma in one study   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.015)$  ) [19] and  rs4905204 associated with insulin resistance  traits in another study   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.03\!\!\cdot\!\!0.04$  ) [20].  

# Strengths and limitations  

The ARIC Carotid MRI study represents a large,  population-based study to examine carotid ath­ ero sclerotic plaques by contrast-enhanced  MRI. To the best of our knowledge, there have  not been other reports of population-based  carotid MRI studies of comparable size. On the  other hand, the uniqueness of the data raised  difficulty in finding replication studies to con­ firm our findings. Departure from HW equilibri­ um was observed for rs4905204, the SNP that  showed significant associations with maximum  wall  thickness  measures  in  European  Americans. Several factors could cause this  deviation, including genotyping errors, inbreed­ ing, population stratification, selection, assor­ tative mating, or chance. Among them, geno­ typing errors and population stratification and  admixture would be the most important to the  validity of our study. Genotyping errors are not  likely, because strict quality control protocols  were implemented for the genotyping. For  rs4905204, the concordance rate of geno­ types between 101 duplicate pairs was   $\mathtt{100\%}$  .  Population stratification is of less concern in  European Americans than in African Americans;  the analysis in European Americans was adjust­ ed for field center, which should reduce the  influence of population stratification on the  observed associations. Also, over-sampling  participants with thick carotid artery walls in  this study might contribute to the HW disequi­ librium because thick carotid artery wall is  associated with atherosclerosis; it has been  shown that a HW test will result in higher false  positive findings of population admixture when  HW test is carried out in cases and controls  together and the test variant is in LD with the  disease locus [14]. Another limitation is that  different SNP- atherosclerosis associations  were observed for African Americans and  European Americans. Differences in genetic  characteristics between the two populations,  such as allele frequency and magnitude of link­ age d is equilibrium, might contribute to the dif­ ferences. For example, the minor allele homo­ zygote of rs4905204 that was mostly res-ponsible for the association between this vari­ ant and the wall thickness and volume mea­ sures in European Americans was not present  in African Americans, making it difficult to repli­ cate this association in African Americans.  More importantly, the size of African American  sample in our study was limited, reducing sta­ tistical power and increasing the possibility of  chance finding   in this sample. Therefore, the  results in African Americans should be inter­ preted with more caution.  

In summary, we found that the rs11628722 of  SERPINA9  previously associated with stroke in  the ARIC study was associated with carotid wall  at hero sclerotic volume in African Americans.  The protein-coding variant rs4905204 was  associated with wall thickness and volume  measures in European Americans. Nevertheless, results from this study need to be rep­ licated in other populations in order to estab­ lish the  SERPINA9  gene as a candidate in the  genetic etiology of carotid atherosclerosis.
