Abstract  Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated various polymorphisms of histone de acetyl as e 9 (HDAC9) gene was strong risk locus for large-vessel stroke, but the results were controversial. This study aims to replicate the association between the previous detected SNPs of HDAC9 and the susceptibility of ischemic stroke. The study population consisted of 262 consecutive patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke and 300 age and gender matched unrelated controls between October 2012 and October 2014. Rs11984041, rs2389995, and rs2240419 of HDAC9 were genotyped and compared between the cases and controls. The SNP rs11984041 of HDAC9 was found non polymorphic in the population involved. The G allele of rs2389995 was found significantly associated with decreased risk of ischemic stroke, no matter with the codominant (AG v.s AA, 0.53 (0.36 – 0.77),  $P\,<\,0.001$  ; GG v.s AA, 0.63 (0.27 – 1.43),  $P<0.001]$  ), dominant   $(\mathrm{AC}+\mathrm{CG}$   v.s AA, 0.54 (0.38 – 0.78),  $P<0.001\$  ), or the recessive model (GG vs AA  $^+$   AG, 0.75 (0.33 – 1.71),  $P<0.001]$  ). On the other hand, The T allele of rs2240419 was found significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, no matter with the codominant (CT v.s CC, 1.75 (1.22 – 2.51),  $P\!<\!0.001$  ; TT v.s CC, 2.67 (1.55 – 4.61),  $P<0.001\big>$  ), dominant   $(\mathrm{CT\mathrm{~+~}T T}$   v.s CC, 1.93 (1.38 – 2.71),  $P<0.001\big>$  ), or the recessive model (TT vs   $\mathrm{CC}+\mathrm{CT},$  , 2.07 (1.23 – 3.47),  $P\!<\!0.001$  ). No linkage d is equilibrium was found between rs2389995 and rs2240419 of HDAC9. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the SNP rs11984041 of HDAC9 was non polymorphic in Chinese Han population. The minor G allele of rs2389995 significantly decreased and the minor Tallele of rs2240419 significantly increased the risk of ischemic stroke.

# Introduction  

Stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD) are one of the most common causes of loss of disability and premature death years worldwide [ 1 ]. About a quarter of all strokes are classified as large-vessel stroke most of which are attributed to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is an important pathological mechanism in the incidence of ischemic stroke. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial vessel wall, with complications such as acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction, and cerebro vascular disease such as stroke [ 2 ,  3 ].  

Large-vessel stroke shares many risk factors with CAD and both conditions have a strong heritable component. Several clinical parameters are associated with common diseases and are helpful for predicting and preventing these common diseases. In a genome-wide association study, the rs11984041 of histone de acetyl as e 9 (HDAC9) gene was identified as the strongest risk locus for large-vessel stroke to date [ 4 ]. Variants at this locus were subsequently shown to be also associated with CAD and common carotid intima media thickness [ 5 ,  6 ], suggesting that the effects of the 7p21.1 region are mediated through atherosclerosis. However, a recent study depended on the Chinese Han population demonstrated the rs11984041 of HDAC9 was not polymorphic at al. Rs2389995 and rs2240419, the two other SNPs of chromosome 7q21.1, were significantly associated with large-vessel stroke risk (  $P$   values of 0.035 and 0.042, respectively) [ 7 ].  

The HDAC9 gene encodes histone de acetyl as e 9, which is known to be involved in heart and muscle tissue development. HDAC9 is a part of the HDAC gene family, which is able to regulate gene expression patterns via de acetyl ate histones, resulting in chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. The present study aims to detect whether the SNPs rs11984041, rs2389995, and rs2240419 of HDAC9 is associated with the risk of large vessel atherosclerosis.  

# Methods  

# Study Population  

The study population consisted of 262 consecutive patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke and 300 age and gender matched unrelated controls between October 2012 and October 2014 at the the general hospital of beijing Militmary region. The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the the general hospital of beijing military region. The diagnosis of ischemic stroke was confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging and/or head computed tomography. Patients with cerebral embolism, arterial inflammation, malignancy, trauma, drugs, blood disease, cerebral infarction caused by vascular malformation or aneurysm, liver and kidney disease, or thyroid disease were excluded from the study. The subjects with cerebro vascular disease, neurological diseases, kidney disease, blood disorders, cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and autoimmune diseases were excluded from the control group. All subjects were of Chinese Han population and informed consent was provided. Population character istics are listed in Table  1 .

# Blood Collection and DNA Extraction  

$2~\mathrm{mL}$   fasting venous blood was taken from the ante cubit al vein and placed in ethylene dia mine tetra acetic acidcontaining tubes. A Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) was used for DNA extraction.  

# Genotyping  

Primers were designed according to the reported sequences on the GenBank database and were synthesized by Shanghai GeneCore Bio technologies Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried out in a total volume of  $25\,\mathrm{{rel}}$   containing  $100\,\mathrm{ng}$   of genomic DNA and 10 pmol of each primer using a 9700 Thermal Cycler System (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) for 35 cycles at  $95\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 40 s,  $58\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 35 s,   $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $40\,\mathrm{s}$  , and a final extension step at   $72\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $5~\mathrm{min}$  . PCR products exhibiting abnormally migrating bands were sequenced using an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc). A sequenced normal control and a negative control (with no DNA sample) were included in every experiment.  

# Statistical Analysis  

The SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS, Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the data. A gene counting method was used to calculate the frequencies of genotypes and alleles in each group and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was analyzed using the    $\chi2$   test. Genotype and allele frequencies in these groups were analyzed using the  $\chi2$   test. The odds ratio (OR) and   $95~\%$   confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Continuous results are expressed as the mean  $\pm\,\mathrm{SD}$   and compared with the Student t-test.  $P$   value  ${<}0.05$   was considered to be a significant difference..  

The linkage d is equilibrium (LD) mapping and the associations between haplotypes of selected SNPs and risk of ischemic stroke were estimated by the HaploView software. The  $P<0.05$   was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.  

# Results  

# Patient Characteristics  

A total of 262 patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke and 300 age and sex matched unrelated controls were enrolled in this study. Demographic data of the population studied and the number of individuals in each group were shown in Table  1 . The cases have a mean age of   $69.9\,\pm\,8.1$  , and the cases  $\mathrm{off}68.8\pm6.8$  . There are 167 males   $(63.7\ \%)$   among the cases and 180 males   $(60.0\ \%)$   among the controls. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age and gender. The smoking rate of the cases is   $47.3\ \%$  , and the alcoholics rate is  $12.6\,\%$  . Hypertension happened in 117 cases and diabetes mellitus happened in 46 cases that developed ischemic stroke. The average total cholesterol of the cases was   $193.9\pm38.9~\mathrm{mg/DL}$  , triglyceride was   $140.0\pm78.2\;\mathrm{mg/}$  dL, HDL-Cholesterol was   $55.0\;\pm\;15.2\;\,\mathrm{mg/DL}$  , LDLCholesterol was   $120.0\,\pm\,38.9\,\mathrm{\mg/DL}$  , uric acid was  $6.5\pm1.5\;\mathrm{mg/FL}$  , and homo cyst eine was   $11.2\pm3.1~\upmu\mathrm{mol/L}$  .  

# Association of HDAC9 Polymorphisms with Ischemic Stroke Susceptibility  

As expected, the distribution of the genotypes of rs2389995 and rs2240419 on HDAC9 conformed to the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium and the genotyping success rate was  $100\,\%$  . However, similar with the previously mentioned study [ 7 ], the present study also found the SNP rs11984041 of HDAC9 was non polymorphic in Chinese Han population.  

The G allele of rs2389995 was found significantly associated with decreased risk of ischemic stroke, no matter with the codominant (AG v.s AA, 0.53 (0.36 – 0.77),  $P\!<\!0.001$  ; GG v.s AA, 0.63 (0.27 – 1.43),  $P<0.001\big>$  ), dominant   $(\mathrm{MG}+\mathrm{MG}$   v.s AA, 0.54 (0.38 – 0.78),  $P\!<\!0.001)$  ), or the recessive model (GG vs AA  $^+$   AG, 0.75 (0.33 – 1.71),  $P\!<\!0.001$  ). On the other hand, The T allele of rs2240419 was found significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, no matter with the codominant (CT v.s CC, 1.75 (1.22 – 2.51),  $P<0.001$  ; TT v.s CC, 2.67 (1.55 – 4.61),  $P\!<\!0.001]$  ), dominant   $(\mathrm{CT}+\mathrm{TT}\,\mathrm{v.s}\,\mathrm{CC}$  ,

 1.93 (1.38 – 2.71),  $P<0.001\big>$  ), or the recessive model (TT vs

  $\mathrm{CC}+\mathrm{CT},$  , 2.07 (1.23 – 3.47),    $P<0.001\$  ). Tables  2  listed the genotyped and allele distributions of the SNPs for the cases and controls.  

The linkage d is equilibrium (LD) analysis between rs2389995 and rs2240419 showed that these two polymorphisms had no linkage d is equilibrium (Fig.  1 ).  

# Discussion  

Stroke is the major cause of adult chronic disability and the third leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease and the malignant tumor [ 8 ]. Approximately   $85\ \%$   of all strokes are ischemic and there are 3 common subtypes of ischemic stroke: small vessel stroke, card i oem boli c, and large artery atherosclerosis, with the last one happened most commonly [ 9 ]. Age, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia have been identified to be the risk factors of stroke. Genetic factors have also been found to be particularly important in the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke, but few associations between genetic factors and ischemic stroke have been replicated.  

The HDAC9 encodes proteins responsible for de acetyl ation of histones and therefore regulation of chromatin structure and gene transcription, and various studies have replicated the role of the HDAC9 gene in stroke [ 6 ,  7 ,  10 – 12 ]. SNP rs11984041, which is within the final intron of the gene HDAC9, was firstly identified by GWAS as a novel risk factor for atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke, with an OR of 1.38(  $95\ \%$   CI, 1.22 – 1.57) [ 4 ]. Another European GWAS study also demonstrated the HDAC9 significantly increased the risk of large-vessel ischaemic stroke, with an OR of 1.42,  $95\ \%$   CI of 1.28 – 1.57 [ 13 ]. Additionally, previous studies demonstrated the polymorphism rs11984041 of HDAC9 gene was not only associated with CAD and common carotid intima media thickness, but also identified as the strongest risk locus for large-vessel stroke to date [ 4 – 6 ]. However, this SNP seems to be non polymorphic at all among the Chinese Han

population based on the data from HapMap. A recent study performed in China also demonstrated the similar resuts, moreover, the other two polymorphisms rs2240419 and rs 2389995 which are 23,271 and 25,442 bp upstream of the above mentioned SNP, were significantly associated with the risk of atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke [ 7 ]. The present study also demonstrated the SNP rs11984041 of HDAC9 was non polymorphic at all in Chinese Han population. And the minor G allele of rs2389995 was found significantly associated with decreased risk of ischemic stroke, but the minor T allele of rs2240419 significantly increased the risk of ischemic stroke.  

The mechanism by which the gene HDAC9 increases the risk of large vessel stroke is still unknown, it may be associated with the accelerate of atherosclerosis [ 14 ]. There are 18 mammalian HDACs, which fall into 4 classes on the basis of their structural and biochemical characteristics [ 15 ]. HDAC9 is expressed in heart, pancreatic islets, neuron, spinal cord, teeth, smooth and skeletal muscles, T lymphocytes, endothelium, and adipose tissues [ 15 ]. The HDAC9 protein is able to inhibit myogenesis, which is involved in the development of heart [ 16 ]. But the deleterious effects on systemic arteries has not been demonstrated yet. On the other hand, it has an effect on neuronal survival by altering brain ischaemic responses. The protein has been shown to protect neurons from apoptosis, both by inhibiting JUN phosphor yl ation and by repressing JUN transcription. Therefore, HDAC inhibitors have been used as a treatment for stroke [ 17 ,  18 ]. Another study also found the macrophage may be involved in atherosclerosis and stroke [ 19 ]. HDAC9 is most abundantly expressed during macrophage differentiation among class IIa HDACs. Systemic and macrophage HDAC9 deficiency reduces at hero scl erosis development in different sites. The molecular mechanisms behind the decreased atherosclerosis are likely multi factorial, including increased macrophage cholesterol efflux and phenotypic switching of macrophages from a pro inflammatory M1 to a less inflammatory M2 state via PPAR  $\cdot\gamma$   [ 19 ]. Also a recent study suggestted that HDAC9 represents the diseaserelevant gene at the stroke and coronary artery disease risk locus on   $7\mathsf{p}21.1$  , and that risk alleles in this region mediate their effects through increased HDAC9 expression. Targeted inhibition of HDAC9 might be a viable strategy to prevent atherosclerosis.  

However, there were some limitation in this study. Firstly is the relative small population number. And a case control study is not of high level of evidence for supporting the conclusion. Second, no functional analysis was performed to understand the mechanism of the association between the SNPs with ischemic stroke. Moreover, besides the SNPs explored in this study, there may have more other polymorphisms in developing atherosclerosis, a genome-wide association study with a large sample size is a better choice for it.  

In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the SNP rs11984041 of HDAC9 was non polymorphic in Chinese Han population. The minor G allele of rs2389995 significantly decreased and the minor T allele of rs2240419 significantly increased the risk of ischemic stroke.
