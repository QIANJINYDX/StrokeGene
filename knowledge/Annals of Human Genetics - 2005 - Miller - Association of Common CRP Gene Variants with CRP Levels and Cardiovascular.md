# Summary  

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-documented marker of at hero sclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. We re sequenced  $C R P$   to identify a comprehensive set of common SNP variants, then studied and replicated their association with baseline CRP level among apparently healthy subjects in the Women’s Health Study (WHS;  $\mathrm{n}=717$  ), Pra vast at in In amma tion/CRP Evaluation trial (PRINCE;  $\mathrm{n}=1{,}110_{c}$  ) and Physicians’ Health Study (PHS;  $\mathrm{n}=509.$  ) cohorts. The minor alleles of four SNPs were consistently associated in all three cohorts with higher CRP, while the minor alleles of two SNPs were associated with lower CRP   $(\mathfrak{p}\,<\,0.05$   for each). Single marker and haplotype analysis in all three cohorts were consistent with functional roles for the   $5^{\prime}$  -ﬂanking triallelic   $\mathrm{SNR}-286\mathrm{C}\!>\!\mathrm{T}\!>\!\mathrm{A}$  and the  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR SNP   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  . None of the SNPs associated with higher CRP were associated with risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke in a prospective, nested case-control study design from the PHS cohort (610 case-control pairs). One SNP,    $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}.$  , was unrelated to CRP levels but associated with decreased risk of MI   $\mathtt{(p=0.001)}$  ). Taken together, these data imply signiﬁcant interactions between both genetic and environmental contributions to the increased CRP levels that predict a greater risk of future a the roth rom bot ic events in epidemiological studies.

# Introduction  

Atherosclerosis is a common high-impact disease inﬂuenced by genetic and environmental factors, and therefore a prototypical complex human disease (Boerwinkle et al.  1996; Frohlich  et al.  2001). In numerous prospective studies, elevated baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been associated with a higher incidence of future cardiovascular events at all levels of LDL cholesterol. For example, in both the Physician’s Health Study (PHS) and Women’s Health Study (WHS), baseline levels of CRP were associated with a two-fold increase in risk of future vascular events, after adjustment for all traditional cardiovascular risk factors (Ridker  et al.  1997, 2002). Other large case-control studies have conﬁrmed the association between CRP and cardiovascular events (Danesh  et al.  2004).  

CRP may act as a marker of in amma tion, or may play a direct role in at hero genesis, but demonstrating a direct effect of CRP has been difﬁcult, as outlined in a recent report (Clapp  et al.  2005). This  $110\mathrm{kDa}$   pentraxin protein appears to be an important component of the innate immune system. CRP promotes agglutination, bacterial capsular swelling, phagocytosis, and complement ﬁxation (Pepys & Hirschﬁeld, 2003; Volanakis, 2001). CRP levels are inﬂuenced by inﬂammatory cytokine levels, and interleukin-6 (IL6) is the primary inducer and regulator of CRP expression (Vickers  et al.  2002; Volanakis, 2001). Levels of CRP may increase by as much as two or three orders of magnitude during the acute phase of infection or injury response (Gabay & Kushner, 1999; Volanakis, 2001). For this reason, CRP levels used for cardiovascular risk prediction are ideally assessed during periods of relative health, and are thus referred to as baseline levels.  

CRP levels are a continuous trait, demonstrating a log-normal distribution with a mean of about   $1.6\,\mathrm{mg/L}$  with a wide variation (Koenig  et al.  1999). The Centers for Disease Control and the American Heart Association have published guidelines to facilitate the application of CRP levels in the determination of cardiovascular risk, such that levels  ${<}1$  , 1 to 3, and  ${>}3\;\mathrm{mg/L}$   correspond to lower, moderate, and higher risk (Ridker, 2003). However, CRP levels predict future vascular events across the full range of levels seen in clinical practice (Ridker & Cook, 2004). Baseline CRP levels are inﬂuenced by a number of factors, including age, smoking status, BMI and ethnicity (Ford  et al.  2003a, 2003b, 2004). They are also a heritable genetic trait, with heritability estimates  $({h_{r}}^{2})$   of 0.40 and 0.39 in two large studies (Pankow  et al. 2001; Vickers  et al.  2002), suggesting that dissection of genetic factors regulating CRP levels is possible.  

Genetic variation at the  CRP  locus has been shown to be associated with CRP levels in prior association studies. However, these studies did not assess genetic variation within    $C R P$   in a comprehensive manner, nor did they assess large numbers of individuals in a replication study design to ensure conﬁdence in the ﬁndings. Three studies have reported no association between  $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   and baseline CRP (Brull  et al.  2003; Chen et al. 2004; Obisesan et al. 2004).  $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$  and $\mathrm{IVS1+29A{>}T}$   were reported to have no association with baseline CRP in one prior study each (Obisesan et al.  2004; Russell  et al.  2004), but each have been associated with higher baseline CRP in more recent studies (Kovacs  et al.  2005; Suk  et al.  2005; Szalai  et al.  2005). Subjects homozygous for a 20 repeat allele of an intronic GT-micro satellite had elevated CRP levels in one previous study (Szalai  et al.  2002).   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$   was associated with lower baseline CRP in three prior studies (Russell  et al.  2004; Suk  et al.  2005; Zee & Ridker, 2002), but was not associated with CRP in three other studies (Brull  et al.  2003; de Maat  et al.  2004; Obisesan  et al.  2004).   $1444\mathrm{{C}\mathrm{{>}T}}$   minor allele homo zy gos it y has been associated with higher baseline CRP (Brull et al.  2003) and higher acute phase CRP (D’Aiuto  et al. 2005). The minor allele of   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   in the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR has been associated with lower baseline CRP (Russell et al.  2004).  

Limited data is available regarding association of    $C R P$  SNPs and cardiovascular events. The minor allele of  $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   was associated with decreased risk of coronary heart disease in a population of Han Chinese (Chen et al.  2004), though not associated with CRP levels in the same population. Possibly as a result of ethnic differences, SNP discovery in that study failed to identify many of the common CRP variants observed in other populations.  

Here, we report re sequencing analysis to comprehensively identify variation within the    $C R P$   locus, followed by genotyping to examine the inﬂuence of such variation on CRP levels in three independent populations. Several  CRP  SNPs are associated with higher or lower CRP values in these individuals, and haplotype analysis permits tentative ident i cation of two SNPs which appear functional in this association. We also examine the inﬂuence of genetic variation at  CRP  SNPs on the risk of future at hero sclerotic cardiovascular events, and ﬁnd that  $C R P$   genetic variation which is associated with higher CRP levels is not associated with a the roth rombotic events.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Subjects  

We evaluated the role of  CRP  SNPs and haplotypes as determinants of plasma CRP levels in three distinct populations, the Women’s Health Study (WHS), the Pra vast at in In amma tion/CRP Evaluation (PRINCE), and the Physician’s Health Study (PHS). In each population sample participants were excluded from analysis if they used post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy, as each of these is known to affect basal CRP levels (Cushman  et al.  1999; Ridker  et al. 1999). Descriptions of each of these three cohorts

∗ Plus-minus values are means  $\pm\,\mathrm{SD}.$  . CRP values are presented as m ith  $25^{\mathrm{th}}\;\&\;75^{\mathrm{th}}$   percentiles. Differences between WHS high or low CRP groups or between PHS matched cases and controls (m.v.  $\mathrm{{(m.v.=}}$   matching variable), are indicated by a  $\mathfrak{p}$   value generated by  $\chi^{2}$    for categorical variables, t-test for continuous variables, and Wilcoxon Rank sum test for CRP. a In the WHS, absence of DM was a selection criterion, BP measures (self-reported) are available only in categorical format.  $^\mathrm{b}\mathrm{In}$   PHS, cholesterol values were recorded categorically without lipid fractions.  

are summarized in Table 1, and have been published previously (Albert  et al.  2001; Ridker  et al.  1997, 2002). As described below, we also evaluated the role of    $C R P$  SNPs and haplotypes as determinants of incident myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke within one of these cohorts, the PHS.  

The WHS cohort comprises an ongoing trial of initially healthy U.S. women who were randomized to aspirin and vitamin E in a two-by-two factorial design and followed over an average period of 10.7 years for incident cardiovascular events. Of these women, nearly 28,000 provided baseline blood samples which had previously been measured for CRP. For the current analysis,  CRP  SNP genotyping in the WHS was undertaken using an extreme phenotype approach among 359 Caucasian women selected for very low CRP levels (CRP  $0.03\mathrm{~-~}0.20~\mathrm{mg/L})$  ), and 358 Caucasian women selected for high CRP levels   $(\mathrm{CRP}>5.0~\mathrm{mg/L})$  ).  

The PRINCE cohort was a multi-centre, community-based trial of the effects of statin therapy on CRP levels, that included a group of 1,702 individuals without known coronary artery disease (primary prevention cohort). For the current analysis, all of these individuals underwent CRP measurement as well as  CRP  SNP genotyping. Of these subjects, 1,437 were Caucasians who were used for studies of linkage d is equilibrium. Of the Caucasians, 1,110 were free of HRT exposure and were used for studies of CRP association.  

Finally, the PHS comprises an ongoing cohort of more than 22,000 initially healthy US men who were randomly assigned to aspirin or beta-carotene and followed over a 14 year period for the occurrence of ﬁrst ever vascular events. For the current analysis we performed a prospective, nested case-control study genotyping each  CRP  SNP among 610 PHS participants who subsequently developed either myocardial infarction   $\mathrm{(n=346)}$  ) or thr ombo embo li c stroke   $\mathrm{{(n=264)}}$  ) during the follow-up period (cases), and among an equal number of study participants who remained free of incident cardiovascular disease during follow-up and were matched to the case participants on the basis of age, smoking status, and time to random iz ation (controls). An additional 86 unmatched controls, making a total of 696 controls, were available for association testing. Of the control subjects 509 also had CRP levels ascertained and thus served as a third reference group for the cross-sectional analyses.  

All human subject research in this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA. In all studies CRP levels were ascertained by validated high-sensitivity assays.  

# Re sequencing Analysis  

Re sequencing was performed on a   $3.5\mathrm{kb}$   contiguous segment of the    $C R P$   gene, starting   $1000{\mathrm{bp}}$   upstream of the transcription initiation site and extending 450bp  $3^{\prime}$  of exon 2. Primers were designed to provide a minimum 180bp overlap between amplicons. Sequencing was performed using standard ABI PRISM TM   BigDye TM Terminator (Applied Biosystems), with electro ph oresis on an Applied Biosystems 3730 Sequence Analyzer. Automated reads were analyzed using Phred, Phrap, Polyphred, and Consed bioinformatics tools (Ewing & Green, 1998; Ewing  et al.  1998). Analysis of protein structure-function for the rare missense SNP identiﬁed in exon 2 was performed according to published methods (Lau & Chasman, 2004).  

# Genotyping  

SNPs were genotyped by either Sequenom ®   matrixassisted laser desorption and ionization-time of ﬂight

 (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry or ABI PRISM ®

  $\mathrm{{TapMan}^{\circledast}}$    assays, according to standard protocols (Leushner & Chiu, 2000; Livak  et al.  1995). A small fraction of these SNPs have been genotyped in previously reported studies:  $\mathrm{IVS1+29A{>}T}$   and   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$   in PRINCE by Taqman (Suk  et al.  2005), and   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$   in PHS (Zee

 & Ridker, 2002) by previously described methods (Cao

 & Hegele, 2000). Mean completion rates were  $96\%$   for WHS;   $99\%$   for PRINCE; and  $96\%$   for PHS. Quality control assays were performed on all sets of samples by blinded repeat genotyping of   $5\%$   of samples. In every case the disc or dance rate was  $\leq1\%$  . Genotyping of the CRP  dinucleotide repeat was performed by PCR using a u ore scent ly labelled primer, with size separation of amp li cation products on an Applied Biosystems 3730 Sequence Analyzer, and comparison to the size marker GeneScan 500 Liz (Applied Biosystems).  

# Statistical Analysis and Haplotype Inference  

Although these three cohorts contain ethnically diverse subjects, and non-Caucasians were included in the sample selection for genotyping, there were insufﬁcient numbers of each non-Caucasian group to perform haplotype inference and association testing, with the exception of limited SNP association testing among PRINCE African-Americans, as presented in the Discussion. The WHS, PRINCE, and PHS cohorts are  $94.0\%$  ,  $85.7\%$  , and  ${\it>}94\%$   Caucasian, respectively. Selecting only Caucasians to avoid confounding from ethnic differences resulted in the following group sizes for association testing: WHS   $\mathrm{(n=717)}$  ), PRINCE   $\mathrm{(n=}$  1,110), and PHS control   $\mathrm{\Omega}(\mathrm{n}\,=\,696$   where 509 had CRP levels measured). Calculation of allele frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) using a    $\chi^{2}$  -test, and pairwise linkage d is equilibrium using the  $r^{2}$    and   $\mathrm{{D^{\prime}}}$  measures were performed in SAS/Genetics ®   v8.2 and 9.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).  

SNP genotypes of WHS subjects   $\mathrm{(n\=\717)}$  ) with low CRP   $(0.03~-~0.20~\mathrm{mg/L}$  ;   $\mathrm{~n~}=\,359$  ) and high CRP   $(>\!5.0\,\mathrm{\mg/L}$  ;  $\mathrm{~n~}=\,358.$  ) were examined by logistic regression to permit calculation of odds ratios for the effect of minor alleles on CRP, both unadjusted and adjusted for BMI, age at random iz ation, and smoking status. In PRINCE   $(\mathrm{n}=1,110)$  ) and PHS controls   $\mathrm{(n=}$  509), tests of individual SNP associations with CRP were performed with linear regression with an additive model of log-transformed baseline CRP against individual SNP genotypes, unadjusted and adjusted for age, BMI, smoking status and gender (for PRINCE). Regressions were performed within the R software system Version 2.0.1 (Copyright 2004, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Genotype frequencies and median CRP were determined for each SNP genotype in the PRINCE and PHS. The effect of genotype on CRP in the PRINCE was also displayed by boxplots, because PRINCE includes samples from both men and women, and across the full range of baseline CRP. Tests for allele and genotype frequency differences for the    $C R P$   dinucleotide repeat between subjects with low or high CRP were performed as a  $\chi^{2}$  -test and Armitage trend test.  

Haplotypes in all three cohorts were inferred only for Caucasians with complete genotyping data using the haplo.em expectation-maximization algorithm allowing for incorporation of covariate data (Schaid  et al.  2002). Only conﬁdently inferred haplotypes (posterior probability    ${\tt>}0.95$  ) with frequency  $\mathord{>}0.01$   in all cohorts were used, leading to a slightly smaller sample size as compared to the SNP association analysis (WHS,  $\mathrm{n}=550$  ; PRINCE,  $\mathrm{n}=1{,}071$  ; PHS,  $\mathrm{n}=446$  ). Tests of haplo- type association were performed in haplo.score (Schaid et al.  2002) to test all haplotypes simultaneously, and then by regression analysis, both unadjusted and adjusted as described for SNP association tests, in the PRINCE and PHS to provide an estimate of the proportion of variance in CRP levels explained by each haplotype. Haplotype regression used H1 (T-G-C-A-G-C-G) as a reference, because it is common and consistently not associated with CRP levels in haplo.score.  

In PHS case-control pairs   $\mathrm{{(n=610)}}$  ), odds ratios,  $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals, and  $\mathfrak{p}$   values are given for the association of genotypes, in the additive mode, with combined incidence of MI and stroke, and each event considered separately, in a conditional logistic regression analysis. Cases and controls were matched by conditioning upon the matching by age, smoking status, and length of follow-up since random iz ation, and further controlling for randomized treatment assignment, history of hypertension, presence or absence of diabetes and BMI. In addition, the relationship between haplotypes and MI and/or ischemic stroke was examined using a haplotype-based conditional logistic regression analysis with stepwise selection procedure conditional on age and smoking, with further adjustments for BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and randomized aspirin/betacarotene treatment assignment after haplotype inference by haplo.em as described.  

# Results  

# CRP Re sequencing  

To comprehensively ascertain both common and rare variants in the    $C R P$   gene that might inﬂuence CRP levels, 192 individuals from the Women’s Health Study (WHS) population were re sequenced. These subjects had extreme discordant baseline CRP levels: WHS Group 1   $(0.5^{\mathrm{th}}$    percentile;  $0.03\mathrm{~-~}0.20~\mathrm{mg/L}$  ;  $\mathrm{n}=48$  ), WHS Group 2   $(86–96^{\mathrm{th}}$    percentile;   $5.0\,\textrm{-}\,10.0\,\textrm{mg/L}$  ;

  $\mathrm{n}=48,$  ), and WHS Group 3   $(>98^{\mathrm{th}}$    percentile; 19.85

  $\mathrm{~-~}174.9~\mathrm{mg/L}$  ;  $\mathrm{n=96}$  ). Initially WHS Group 3 was not going to be studied, to exclude individuals whose CRP levels might be high due to an unrecognized underlying in amma tory state or acute illness. However, during the course of this study newer analyses showed that even the highest levels of baseline CRP correspond to a graded increase in cardiovascular risk (Ridker & Cook, 2004), prompting us to include the 96 subjects from WHS Group 3 for re sequencing and genotyping. Seven common  CRP  SNPs for which the minor allele frequency (MAF) was    $>\,0.05$   were identiﬁed, consisting of three   $5^{\prime}$  -ﬂanking, one intronic, one exonic, and two  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR SNP (Figure 1 and Table 2A). Notably,

  $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   is a triallelic SNP occurring at position

  $-\,286$   relative to the transcriptional initiation site. Initial analyses on the192 re sequenced subjects indicated that the minor allele of 6 out of the 7  CRP  SNPs was associated with higher or lower CRP values (data not shown), prompting further examination of these associations in the WHS and other populations. An intronic micro satellite polymorphism was also identiﬁed by resequencing, as previously described (Szalai  et al.  2002). Multiple novel rare variants were also identiﬁed by  

re sequencing, including: four single nucleotide variants

Structure of human  $C R P$  , located at chromosome band 1q23. Human    $C R P$   consists of two exons (black/gray boxes). The coding regions of exons 1 and 2 (black) correspond to a 204 amino acid peptide, separated by a single    $\sim\!280\mathrm{bp}$  on containing a micro satellite repeat denoted  CRP  $(\mathrm{GT)_{n}}$  . A short  $(104\mathrm{{b}\mathrm{{p})}}$  )  $5^{\prime}$  -untranslated, and relatively longer   $(\sim1.2\mathrm{kb)}$   $3^{\prime}$  -untranslated region (gray) ﬂank the gene. Approximately 1060bp of   $5^{\prime}$  -ﬂanking and 175bp of   $3^{\prime}$  -ﬂanking sequences were included in the re sequencing for SNP discovery. Common SNPs are indicated.

 $^{*}{\mathrm{SNP}}$   major alleles in our study were assigned according to the allele present with respect to the “sense” orientation of the  CRP  gene. In some cases this changes the designation from the way it was originally reported.  

each in the  $5^{\prime}$  -ﬂanking region and   $3^{\prime}$  -untranslated region, and a single non synonymous variant in exon 2 (Table 2B). The non synonymous SNP causes a  $\mathrm{T}45\mathrm{M}$  amino acid substitution and is predicted to be deleterious to protein function according an algorithm designed to predict functional protein variants (Lau & Chasman, 2004). Each rare variant was found in, at most, 3 out of 196 subjects, precluding our ability to examine their effect on baseline CRP in the general population. The effects of these rare variants may be pursued in future studies.  

# CRP Genotyping  

The seven common  CRP  SNPs were genotyped in 717 WHS samples with low   $(0.03-0.20\:\mathrm{mg/L}$  ;  $\mathrm{n}=359$  ) or high   $(>\!5.0~\mathrm{mg/L}$  ;  $\mathrm{n}=358$  ) baseline CRP. Two additional replication populations were then genotyped: the Pra vast at in In amma tion/CRP Evaluation (PRINCE) cohort   $(\mathrm{n}\,=\,1,702)$  ), and case-control pairs from the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS) cohort, in which cases had either MI or ischemic stroke   $\mathrm{(n=610}$   cases and 696 controls). All seven SNP were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium   $(\mathfrak{p}\;>\;0.05$   for    $\chi^{2}$    test) in the full set of samples assayed within each of the three cohorts, as well as in Caucasians only. Minor allele frequencies for the seven  CRP  SNP were similar among Caucasians in the three populations, although signiﬁcant differences in MAF were observed between the low CRP and high CRP WHS groups (Table 3). Genotyping the    $C R P$   intronic GT dinucleotide polymorphism in a smaller set of WHS samples showed three common alleles among

# Linkage D is e quil b rium (LD) Patterns Among Variants in CRP  

Pairwise LD statistics were calculated for seven  CRP SNPs among Caucasians in the WHS, PRINCE and PHS cohorts (Figure 2). Non-Caucasian samples were excluded due to known ethnic differences in LD patterns; the small number of these samples precluded separate analysis among non-Caucasians. In Caucasians, 3 out of the 7  CRP  SNPs shared a pattern of pairwise LD with    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$  , the triallelic SNP (black boxes in Figure 2). The minor allele of    $\mathrm{~-\,757T{>}C}$  was in LD with the A allele of    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$  . The other minor allele of    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   (T) was in LD with   $\mathrm{Ileqslant1+29A>T}$   and   $1444\mathrm{{C}\mathrm{{>}T.}}$   These high pairwise LD relationships were observed in all three cohorts.    $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}.$  ,   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C},$  , and   $1846G{>}\mathrm{A}$   showed only weak LD by the    $r^{2}$    measure. None of the alleles of the    $C R P$   micro satellite showed strong LD with any of the 7  CRP  SNP (data not shown,  $r^{2}<0.3$   for each comparison).  

# Association Between CRP Variants and Baseline CRP  

Association of    $C R P$   genotypes with CRP level was examined with logistic regression (in WHS) and linear regression (in PRINCE and PHS) methods both before and after adjustment for the effects of age, smoking, and BMI. Highly signiﬁcant and consistent associations were seen between the minor allele of  $\mathrm{{SNPs-757T\!>\!C}},$  , high CRP levels across populations with p values ranging as low as   $10^{-7}$    (Table 4). Following adjustment for covariates, similar highly signiﬁcant and strong associations were observed, with some modest weakening of the association in the WHS and strengthening of the association in the PRINCE. In addition, highly signiﬁ- cant and consistent associations were also seen between the minor allele of   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$   and   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   and low CRP levels in all three populations in both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses (Table 4). An association in the PHS population was not seen for   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$  , possibly due to the relatively low minor allele frequency for this SNP (0.06) and the smaller sample size in comparison to the other cohorts. None of the 9 alleles at the intronic micro satellite were associated with baseline CRP   $(\chi^{2}$    for trend 11.95 with 8 degrees of freedom; p for trend 0.15).  

The correlation between genotypes at the  CRP  SNPs and CRP levels in the PRINCE primary prevention subjects is shown in Figure 3. Due to the discordant phenotype design, such results cannot be presented for the WHS; the PHS control population is much smaller and includes only males.  $-\,757\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}$   was associated with an increase in median CRP of   $0.39\mathrm{ms/L}$   compared to the major allele homozygote   $\left({\mathfrak{p}}=0.008\right)$  ; for  $-\,286\mathrm{TT}$  and TA genotypes the increase in median CRP levels was 0.40 and   $1.03\;\mathrm{mg/L}$     $({\mathfrak{p}}=0.009$   and 0.002, respectively). In contrast, the   $1059\mathrm{CC}$   and 1846AA genotypes were associated with a reduction of median CRP levels of 0.35 and   $0.51~\mathrm{mg/L}$  , respectively   $\mathrm{(p=0.007}$  and 0.00001, respectively). Thus, several common    $C R P$  SNPs were associated with CRP levels.

# Haplotype Analysis in the WHS, PRINCE, and PHS Cohorts  

Haplotypes formed by the 7  CRP  SNPs were inferred in Caucasians from the WHS, PRINCE, and PHS populations using haplo.em (Schaid  et al.  2002). The WHS and PRINCE subjects exposed to HRT, and any subjects with incomplete genotyping data, were excluded prior to haplotype inference. Six haplotypes, H1-H6, with a frequency of 0.01 or greater were identiﬁed in all three cohorts (Table 5).  

Two of the six common haplotypes, H2 and H5, were associated with higher CRP in all three cohorts using haplo.score (Table 6). Two others, H3 and H4, were associated with lower CRP across cohorts, with the exception that H4 was not sign i cant ly associated with CRP in the PHS. The two common haplotypes associated with higher CRP each contained a minor allele of the triallelic  $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$  . In contrast, the two common haplotypes associated with lower CRP each contained the minor allele of   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  . In addition, the common H4 haplotype contained the minor allele of  

SNP with baseline CRP. In WHS, where the CRP trait is binary (low vs. high CRP) the effect of CRP is given as an odds ratio. In PRINCE and PHS, where CRP is a continuous trait, genotype frequencies and median CRP levels are provided for each genotype. P values for the association are given unadjusted and adjusted  CRP  Association of Table 4

Variation in CRP level by SNP genotype was determined for Caucasian subjects from the PRINCE primary prevention cohort   $\mathrm{(n=}$  1,110). Results are presented as boxplots to describe variation in log-transformed CRP, where boxes extend from the 25 percentile to 75 percentile (interquartile range). The line within each box marks the median CRP value by genotype, indicated above the line as the non-transformed value in  $\mathrm{mg/L}$  .

the less common   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$   SNP. The association between  $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   minor allele haplotypes and CRP levels were highly statistically signiﬁcant in all three populations, including after adjustment for age, BMI, and smoking in Caucasians, with p values    $<\,10^{-5}$    in simulation testing. The association of the   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   minor allele haplotype H3 with lower CRP was also very consistent in the three populations. The lack of consistency of the H4 association may partially reﬂect that its frequency is lower than H3.  

# CRP SNP Association with A the roth rom bot ic Events in the PHS Population  

Since multiple epidemiologic studies have indicated that elevated CRP levels are associated with increased rates of a the roth rom bot ic events – MI or ischemic stroke – we examined the possibility that CRP genetic variation might also be associated with a the roth rom bot ic risk. We examined 610 PHS subjects with a history of MI or ischemic stroke matched by age and smoking status with PHS controls   $\mathrm{\Omega}_{\mathrm{n}}~=~346$   MI pairs;  $\mathrm{~n~}=\,264$   ischemic stroke pairs). Although increased CRP is known to increase the risk of a the roth rombotic events, and several    $C R P$   genotypes are associated with increased CRP levels, none of the minor alleles of  $\mathrm{-757T{>}C,-286C{>}T{>}A}$  ,   $\mathrm{IVS+29A>T,}$  ,  $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$  , or   $1444\mathrm{{C}\mathrm{{>}T}}$   were associated with development of either MI or ischemic stroke (Table 7). Instead, the minor allele of    $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$  , not associated with CRP levels in any of the populations in this study, except for a marginal association in the WHS (O.R. 0.79,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}~0.63{-}1.00$  ,  ${\tt p}=0.049$  ), was associated with reduced risk of at hero thrombosis (any event: O.R. 0.80,  $95\%$   CI 0.66–0.97,  ${\tt p}=0.020$  ; MI: O.R. 0.66;  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI~0.52-}$  0.85;  ${\tt p}=0.001$  ) in a stepwise conditional logistic regression analysis. In addition, the haplotype deﬁned by the minor allele of  $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$  , H1, was associated with a decreased risk of MI (O.R. 0.64;   $95\%$   CI 0.52–0.90;  $\tt{p}=0.002,$  ) in a haplotype-based conditional analysis with forward-stepwise selection procedure. Even more surprising, the   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   minor allele that had been associated with lower baseline CRP in the PHS and PRINCE was found to be associated with an increased risk of a the roth rom bot ic events in the PHS in the additive mode (O.R. 1.27;   $95\%$   CI 1.04-1.55;  $\mathtt{p}=0.022)$  ). Thus, the association between    $C R P$   variants and baseline CRP did not correlate with the effects of those variants on clinical cardiovascular events.  

# Discussion  

We had two main goals in this study: 1) to comprehensively identify genetic variation within the    $C R P$   locus and examine its potential effects on baseline CRP, and 2) to investigate potential associations of such    $C R P$   variants with adverse cardiovascular events. The WHS and PRINCE cohorts were chosen in pursuit of the ﬁrst goal, while the PHS was chosen in pursuit of the ﬁrst and second goals. The WHS study examined subjects with extreme discordant phenotypes by re sequencing, with the goal of identifying both rare and common variants that might be associated with CRP levels. Several rare variants in  $C R P$  , including a previously undescribed exon 2 missense change, T45M, were identiﬁed. Coding region variation affecting the amino acid sequence of CRP has not been previously described, and an analysis

of protein structure-function (Lau & Chasman, 2004) suggests that the   $\mathrm{T}45\mathrm{M}$   change would have signiﬁcant effects on protein function. However, the low frequency of this and the other rare variants discovered makes analysis of their association with CRP levels difﬁcult.  

This comprehensive re sequencing and genotyping analysis of  CRP  provides deﬁnitive information on the common genetic variants of    $C R P$  , augmenting several more limited analyses that have been published recently (Brull  et al.  2003; Chen  et al.  2004; D’Aiuto  et al.  2005; Kovacs  et al.  2005; Obisesan  et al.  2004; Russell  et al. 2004; Suk  et al.  2005; Zee & Ridker, 2002). Our study also adds information to the CRP re sequencing performed in the Seattle SNPs PGA (Seattle SNPs - accessed April, 2004) by looking at larger numbers of subjects and extreme phenotypes to identify rare variants. In addition, the initial analysis of  CRP  SNP allele frequencies in our re sequenced extreme phenotype populations (data not shown) immediately identiﬁed associations with CRP levels, permitting three levels of replication of these ﬁndings, one based on additional subjects within the same WHS population, and two within the PRINCE and PHS control populations. The associations between the minor alleles of 5 of these  CRP  SNPs and higher or lower CRP levels were remarkably consistent among the three sets of genotyped individuals (Table 4).  

The minor alleles of    $\mathrm{~-\,757T{>}C}$  ,   $\mathrm{IVS1+29A{>}T,}$  ,  $1444\mathrm{{C}\mathrm{{>}T},}$  , and both minor alleles of    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$  were all strongly associated with higher CRP levels in all four analyses. Linkage d is equilibrium and haplotype analyses suggest that    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   is the functional SNP among these, and that the associations seen with the other SNPs are due to strong LD between their minor alleles and one or the other minor allele of  $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$  . There are similar effects and statistical sign i can ce in the association between the minor allele of    $-\,757\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$   and CRP, and the A allele of    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   and CRP, in all three populations (Table 4). This observation correlates with the near perfect LD relationship between these two alleles (Figure 2,  $r^{2}\:\:0.975{-}1.000)$  . Similar observations can be made in regard to the association of each of the minor alleles of  $\mathrm{Ileqslant1+29A>T}$   and   $1444\mathrm{{C}\mathrm{{>}T_{\ast}}}$  , as well as the T allele of    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$  , with high CRP levels (Table 4). In addition, there is high LD among each of these minor alleles (Figure 2,  $r^{2}\!\ge\!0.91\!,$  ). Haplotype analysis indicates that two common haplotypes, H2 and H5, are associated with higher CRP in all three cohorts. H2 consists of the minor alleles of  $\mathrm{IVS1+29A{>}T}$   and   $1444\mathrm{{C}\mathrm{{>}T}}$   and the T allele of    $-\,286\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{A}.$   H5 consists of the minor allele of    $\mathrm{~-\,757T{>}C}$   and the A allele of    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$  . Although it is possible that multiple  CRP  SNPs have independent effects on baseline CRP levels, possibly in an additive fashion, the similar results for single SNP and haplotype associations of    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   and CRP level lead us to favour the more parsimonious explanation that    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   is the functional SNP and that both of the minor alleles lead to high baseline CRP levels through a transcriptional mechanism. In  

addition, our re sequencing analysis eliminated the possibility that some other common variant, within    $C R P$  and in LD with  $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$  , is responsible for the association of    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   and CRP level. Indeed, recent functional studies support the conclusion that  $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   is a functional SNP that modulates transcription factor binding (Szalai  et al.  2005).  

The minor alleles of two  CRP  SNPs,   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$   and  $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  , were associated with lower baseline CRP levels (Table 4). These ﬁndings are similar to those previously reported in smaller series (Brull  et al.  2003; Chen et al.  2004; Kovacs  et al.  2005; Obisesan  et al.  2004; Russell  et al.  2004; Suk  et al.  2005; Zee & Ridker, 2002). Because of different minor allele frequencies, there is only weak LD between these SNP as measured by    $r^{2}$  , suggesting the possibility that each SNP contributes to the effect. Haplotype analysis indicated that two haplotypes, H3 and H4, were strongly associated with lower CRP levels in the WHS and PRINCE populations. However, the association of H4 with lower CRP was not seen in the PHS control population, possibly due to its much smaller size or random chance. H3 contains the minor allele of   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   only, whereas H4 contains the minor allele of both  $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$   and   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  , consistent with the ﬁnding of high LD between   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$  and   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   as measured by  $\mathrm{D^{\prime}}$  , a measure less sensitive to differences in MAF   $(\mathrm{D^{\prime}}=0.758$   in WHS, 0.979 in PRINCE, and 0.919 in PHS). Although it is possible that both SNPs inﬂuence CRP values, we favour the simpler explanation that  $1846G{>}\mathrm{A}$   inﬂuences CRP mRNA stability, thereby affecting CRP levels, and that the association of   $1059\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$   with CRP levels is due to its inclusion on a relatively common haplotype with the minor allele of   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  . A similar hypothesis for the effect of  $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   was made recently (Russell  et al. 2004); further study will be required to explore this possibility.  

Haplotype-based linear regression was also used to investigate the proportion of variance in baseline CRP explained by    $C R P$   genotype. In the unadjusted analysis, the proportion of variance (adjusted  $\mathrm{R}^{2}$    value) in logtransformed CRP levels explained by    $C R P$   haplotypes was 0.021 in the PRINCE, and 0.049 in the PHS. Although overall these are small effects, they must be considered relative to the many factors that likely inﬂuence CRP levels, and are relatively large for a genetic effect in a complex disease setting. Nonetheless, the proportion of variance due to age, BMI, and smoking – about  $21\%$  and   $20\%$   in the PRINCE and PHS – was sign i cant ly higher than that attributable to variation in the  CRP gene – about   $2\%$   and   $5\%$   in the PRINCE and PHS, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of variance explained by these  CRP  SNPs is small relative to the calculated heritability of baseline CRP, estimated at 0.40 and 0.39 in two large studies (Pankow  et al.  2001; Vickers et al.  2002), suggesting the presence of additional, as yet un ident i ed, genetic variants that substantially inﬂuence CRP levels.  

One concern about any cohort-based study is how well the results can be extended to the general population. The replication of these ﬁndings in three independent cohorts provides high conﬁdence in such genera liz ation. However, although these cohorts contain subjects representing multiple ethnic groups, only the Caucasian subset provides enough subjects to perform statistically powerful analyses. The ability to generalize these ﬁndings to other ethnic groups will depend upon the allele frequencies and patterns of LD in the other groups. In an effort to investigate these associations in another ethnic group, we repeated the linear regression of ln(CRP) as a function of    $C R P$   genotypes in African-Americans from the PRINCE primary prevention cohort   $\mathrm{(n=99)}$  ). Too few African-Americans were available from the other cohorts to perform similar analyses. In this small sample,  $-\,286\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}$   was associated with higher CRP in the crude analysis   $\mathrm{(p=0.048)}$   and  $1846G{>}\mathrm{A}$   with lower CRP   $\mathtt{(p=0.050)}$  ). This limited analysis supports the idea that the associations persist in other ethnic groups, but further investigation and replication are warranted. They also highlight the likely importance of    $\mathrm{-\,286C>T>A}$   and   $1846G{>}\mathrm{A}$   in driving effects on CRP levels.  

For investigation of the relationship between  CRP variants and cardiovascular endpoints, we studied 610 PHS case-control pairs for MI or ischemic stroke. None of the minor alleles of the  CRP  SNPs were associated with risk of a the roth rom bot ic events in the direction predicted by the association of SNP genotype with CRP level. Instead, the minor allele of    $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$  was associated with reduced risk of a the roth rom bot ic events in this analysis   $\tt(p\ =\ 0.020$   for any event), particularly for myocardial infarction   $\mathrm{\Lambda}(\mathtt{p}~=~0.001$  , Table 7). This relationship could also be observed in the association between haplotype H1, bearing the minor allele of    $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   only, with reduced risk of MI (O.R. 0.67,   $95\%$   CI 0.51–0.88,  $\mathtt{p}=0.004\mathtt{\rangle}$  ). Furthermore, the minor allele of   $1846\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  , associated with lower baseline CRP and possibly a functional variant in    $C R P$  , was weakly associated with an increased risk of at hero sclerotic events in the PHS population (O.R. 1.27,  $95\%$   CI 1.04-1.55,  ${\tt p}=0.022$   for any event).  

Our results for    $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   and cardiovascular events replicate a recently reported association between the presence of the    $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   minor allele and decreased risk of coronary heart disease (Chen  et al.  2004). The other study reported a signiﬁcant increase in coronary heart disease among Han Chinese carrying the major allele of    $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$  , with no effect on baseline CRP. That study was retrospective and used a less stringent clinical endpoint, which included coronary revascularization in addition to MI and stroke. Replication of this association in an independent prospective cohort with different ethnicity and a more clear clinical endpoint suggests a true association of    $-\,717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   with cardiovascular events, albeit one that cannot be explained on the basis of altered CRP levels. Other studies have also found paradoxical associations between genotypes that predict increased levels of adverse serum markers but decreased risk of cardiovascular events (Keavney  et al. 2004).  

# Conclusions  

In summary, we clearly deﬁne several  CRP  SNPs strongly associated with CRP levels, either positively or negatively, in three separate cohorts of initially healthy men and women. Our prospective nested case-control analysis within the PHS identiﬁed an association between the minor allele of  $\cdot-717\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   and decreased risk of cardiovascular events. Further studies will be needed to explore the mechanism for this association, as we were not able to direction ally link  CRP  SNPs that affect CRP levels to the risk of future a the roth rom bot ic events.  CRP  SNPs explain a much smaller proportion of the variance in CRP   $(2{-}5\%)$  , as compared to environmental exposures and lifestyle factors as well as other genetic loci, and thus the ability of these SNPs to inﬂuence a the roth rom bot ic risk may be obscured by the strong effects of these other factors in aggregate. When other genetic loci that affect CRP levels are discovered, it will be of interest to assess their potential inﬂuence on cardiovascular risk.
