Objective : Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute to complex disorders such as ischemic stroke (IS). Since SNPs could affect IS by altering gene expression, we studied the association of common SNPs with changes in mRNA expression (i.e. expression quantitative trait loci; eQTL) in blood after IS. Methods : RNA and DNA were isolated from 137 patients with acute IS and 138 vascular risk factor controls (VRFC). Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix HTA 2.0 micro arrays and SNP variants were assessed with Axiom Biobank Genotyping micro arrays. A linear model with a genotype (SNP)    $\times$  diagnosis (IS and VRFC) interaction term was ﬁt for each SNP-gene pair. Results : The eQTL interaction analysis revealed signiﬁcant genotype    $\times$   diagnosis interaction for four SNP-gene pairs as  cis -eQTL and 70 SNP-gene pairs as trans -eQTL.  Cis -eQTL involved in the in amma tory response to IS included rs56348411 which correlated with neuro gran in expression ( NRGN ), rs78046578 which correlated with  CXCL10  expression, rs975903 which correlated with SMAD4  expression, and rs62299879 which correlated with  CD38  expression. These four genes are important in regulating in amma tory response and BBB stabilization. SNP rs148791848 was a strong trans -eQTL for anosmin-1 ( ANOS1 ) which is involved in neural cell adhesion and axonal migration and may be important after stroke.  Interpretation : This study highlights the contribution of genetic variation to regulating gene expression following IS. Speciﬁc in amma tory response to stroke is at least partially inﬂuenced by genetic variation. This has implications for progressing toward personalized treatment strategies. Additional research is required to investigate these genes as therapeutic targets.

assessed the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene expression (mRNA levels) following IS. SNPs that affect RNA expression are called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). These are widespread in the genome and account for part of the genetic effects that contribute to complex genetic diseases. eQTLs are divided into those with local effects ( cis -eQTLs), where the genetic variant is located within 1 megabase (Mb) of the affected gene, and those with distant effects ( trans - eQTLs), where the genetic variant is further away or on a   different chromosome. Analysis of eQTL in large cohorts (e.g., GTEx) has shown many diseases associated loci regulate nearby genes, though a substantial fraction of dis8   ease associated loci still remain unexplained and are  

# Introduction  

Gene expression studies of blood have shown different gene proﬁles for ischemic stroke (IS) compared to con  trols, and different proﬁles for IS compared to intracere  bral hemorrhage. There are different proﬁles for varying causes of   $\mathrm{IS}^{3}$    that can predict causes of crypto geni c   strokes where the cause is not otherwise known. Moreover gene expression proﬁles in blood of IS patients prior to administration of tPA predict those who develop hem  orrhagic transformation one day later. These data raise the question of whether some changes of gene expression might be genetically programmed, given that stroke has a   heritability ranging from 0.16 to 0.40. Thus, this study  

likely  trans -eQTL found mainly in noncoding regions of the genome.  

Blood is used here in part because it is readily accessible in humans. More importantly, studying blood following stroke provides an index of the coagulation status of each patient as well as in amma tory and immune response mechanisms following stroke that in part determine outcome.  

In this study, we have explored the inﬂuence of SNP genotype on expression of genes that are different between blood of IS and controls. These eQTLs could provide possible mechanisms by which SNPs inﬂuence IS outcomes and provide prognostic and treatment targets.  

# Materials and Methods  

The research protocol was approved by institutional review boards of the University of California at Davis, University of California at San Francisco and the University of Alberta. All subjects provided written informed consent and RNA and DNA were isolated from blood samples collected from 137 ischemic stroke (IS) patients and 138 vascular risk factor matched controls including diabetes and/or hypertension and/or hypercholesterolemia (VRFC). Gene expression of all protein-coding transcripts 10   was quantiﬁed by Affymetrix HTA 2.0 micro arrays and variants assessed by Axiom Biobank Genotyping microarrays. To identify a linear regression model with a genotype    $\times$   diagnosis interaction term for each SNP-gene pair was utilized and tested for sign i can ce. All the analyses were conducted using the Matrix eQTL package in the R   statistical environment as described previously. Additional detailed information is provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods File.  

# Results  

# Patient characteristics  

Subject characteristics including age, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia) for 137 IS and 138 VRFC subjects are presented in Table 1. The mean age (  $\pm$   standard deviation (SD)) of the male

  $\mathrm{{'n=86'}}$  ) and the female   $(\mathsf{n}=51\$  ) stroke subjects were

  $59.5\,\pm\,12.2$   and   $64.6\,\pm\,14.2$  , respectively. Average ages of the male   $(\mathrm{n}=70)$  ) and female   $\mathrm{(n=68)}$  ) VCRF subjects were   $59.1\,\pm\,14.4$   and   $62.8\,\pm\,11.9$  , respectively. There were no signiﬁcant differences in subject demographics for age, sex, race, smoking status, alcohol consumption or vascular risk factors including diabetes and/or hypertension and/or hypercholesterolemia between IS and VRFC groups (Table 1).

# Analysis of genotype (SNP)    $\times$   diagnosis effect on gene expression  

The SNP-gene pair interactions show the impact of genotype (SNP) on gene expression when the interaction signiﬁcantly differs between IS and VFRC subjects. These SNP-gene pairs from the interaction analysis can indicate one of three different biological properties. First, they can represent eQTL in VFRC or IS but not both. Second, eQTLs can indicate an opposite directional effect between VFRC and IS. Third, eQTL may be in the same direction but of sign i cant ly different magnitude of impact between VFRC and IS. More formally, the interaction term assesses whether there is a signiﬁcant difference in the slope of the genotype-expression regression line between VRFC individuals and IS patients (Figure 1).

Linear interaction between genotype   $(x\cdot$  -axis) of rs56348411 and diagnosis (IS and VRFC) on gene expression of  NRGN    $\left(y\cdot\right.$  -axis). Mean gene expression from the signal space transformation, in conjunction with regular robust multiplearray average normalization method (SST-RMA)   $(y$  -axis) with standard error bars are plotted by SNP genotype   $'\!X\!\cdot$  -axis: CC, CT, TT) and diagnosis status (red - IS; green - VRFC). The beta was 0.313,    $P$  value  $=2.10\mathbb{E}{\cdot}08$  ; and   $\mathsf{F D R}=0.088$   (Table 2). IS - ischemic stroke. VRFC - vascular risk factor control.  

The  cis -eQTL analysis indicated 38 SNP-gene pairs with a    $P$   value cut-off below   $1.0\,\times\,10^{-5}$    (Table 2). Four of these  cis -eQTL had FDR  $<\,0.25$  . The signiﬁcant associated genes for these four cis -eQTL SNPs were: NRGN

 (rs56348411) (Figure 1),  CXCL10  (rs78046578),  SMAD4

 (rs975903) and  CD38  (rs62299879) (Table 2). Note that genotype rs56348411 (C/T) is a variant associated with a strong eQTL (  $P$   value    $=2.10\,\times\,{10}^{-8}$  ,   $\mathrm{FDR}=0.08$  ) for NRGN  expression in blood (Table 2).  

The  trans -eQTL analysis showed 70 SNP-gene pairs (39 SNPs) affecting 23 genes and meeting the cut-off    $P$  value  $<\,1.0\,\times\,10^{-11}$  with  $\mathrm{FDR}<0.01$  (Table 3 and Table 4). In other words, using a   $1\%$   FDR threshold, we identiﬁed 23 genes with  trans -eQTL exhibiting a genotype  $\times$   diagnosis interaction effect. Among these genes, two X-linked genes  ANOS1  and  POF1B  were found. Expression of an X-linked gene  ANOS1  was sign i cant ly correlated with intergenic variants including rs 148791848 and rs 149957475. Expression of another X-linked premature ovarian failure gene  POF1B  was sign i cant ly correlated with intergenic variant rs950391 (Table 3).  

For  trans -eQTL a single SNP usually affected the expression of several genes, from two to ﬁve. For example, the AA variant of rs2369519 found on the X chromosome increased expression of:  ABCA6  on chromosome 17, EML6  on chromosome 2, and  CLNK  on chromosome 4 in stroke compared to VRFC (Figure 2) (Table 3). The 70 trans -eQTL affected the expression of only 23 genes, meaning a given gene was regulated by multiple  trans - eQTL.  

We also investigated the signiﬁcant  ciseQTL and  trans - eQTL genes found in genes associated with stroke. The Har moniz ome web portal “http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/ Har moniz ome/gene_set/Stroke/CTD  $^{1+}$  Gene-Disease+Assoc iations” includes 1187 genes sign i cant ly associated with   stroke. We found that three   $(3/36=8.33\%$  ) and four (  $(4/23=17.39\%)$   of our genes from  cis -eQTL and  trans - eQTL results, respectively, were sign i cant ly associated with stroke. The signiﬁcant associated genes from our eQTL results were  PTPRC ,  UGCG ,  ZBTB16, CCL2 ,  CD38 , and  ITGA1  (Tables 2, 3 and 4).  

# Discussion  

eQTL have revealed disease-associated variants and identiﬁed expression of genes that are inﬂuenced by a particular   allele. In this study, we identiﬁed SNPs in both the  cis and  trans  relation that correlated with changes in gene expression after ischemic stroke (IS). Though an increasing number of genetic studies are discovering many SNPs – 16   sign i cant ly associated with IS, how the genotypes modulate IS are usually unknown. The eQTL identiﬁed in this study are SNPs that drive changes of gene expression following IS and thus provide insight into their effect in stroke.  

The strongest  cis -eQTLs were involved in the inﬂammatory response to IS including rs78046578 that correlated with  CXCL10  expression, rs975903 that correlated with  SMAD4  expression, rs62299879 that correlated with CD38  expression, and rs56348411 that correlated with neuro gran in ( NRGN ) expression. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) mediates in amma tory responses and is a che mo attract ant for activated T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and blood mono  cytes. CXCL10 directly binds IL6, both having key   in amma tory roles in IS. CXCL10 level is increased in post-mortem ischemic stroke brain and is involved in blood – brain barrier (BBB) breakdown following IS.  

SMAD4 is associated with in amma tion and hypercoagulation in ischemic stroke and development of thrombolysis related hemorrhagic transformation. A subset of stroke patients may be more prone to hemorrhagic transformation as a result of differences in SMAD4 signaling   in circulating leukocytes. Mutations in  SMAD4  cause the hereditary hemorrhagic tel angie ct asia syndrome and native SMAD4 regulates N-cadherin expression in   endo the li al cells to stabilize the BBB. The expression of  SMAD4  is higher after IS, and as we observe in this study, particularly higher in those individuals with the GG allele of rs975903. SMAD4 could be important in endogenous thr ombo lysis following IS.  

CD (cluster of differentiation) proteins, including CD38, play a role in cell signaling and cell adhesion. Our

previous studies indicated  CD46  and zinc-ﬁnger family, ZNF  ( ZNF185  and  ZNF254 ) expression as a biomarker distinguishing the cause of ischemic stroke as cardioem  bolic or large-vessel disease. Leukemic blast cells over  express CD38 in pediatric ischemic stroke. Following focal ischemia, astrocytic release of extracellular mito- chondrial particles is mediated by a calcium-dependent   mechanism involving CD38. Suppression of CD38 signaling by short interfering RNA reduced extracellular mitochondria transfer and worsened neurological out  comes. CD38 is a NAD-consuming protein that synthesizes NADH and may be involved in vascular repair   following stroke. In contrast, CD38-deﬁcient mice have decreased chemokines, immune cell in lt ration and   infarct volumes following stroke. CD38 levels increase in monocytes, macrophages, and T and B lymphocytes following stroke in humans.  

Neuro gran in (NRGN) is expressed in tel en cephalic neurons, particularly dendritic spines, and is involved in synaptic signaling by regulating calmodulin (CaM) availability. NRGN levels in plasma reﬂect stroke volume. Neuro gran in is involved in maintaining quiescent B 28     cells and modulating T-cell apoptosis. Thus, neurogranin might play a role in B- and T-cell regulation and perhaps of other mono nuclear cells in blood of patients with stroke. Our results show that there is a distinct difference in expression of  NRGN  that is higher in ischemic stroke patients that have the CC allele (rs56348411) and CC allele (rs7129315), both in the nearby gene TMEM218 . Based on databases of known protein-protein interaction and biological pathways, there is no known existing relationship between these molecules. Identiﬁcation of the  cis -eQTL involving the pair through our  $\mathrm{SNR}\;\times$   diagnosis analysis may suggest a relational dependence related to a pathological state rather than functional relationship at baseline.  

Several zinc-ﬁnger family (ZNF) transcripts were identiﬁed as cis -eQTL: rs11809423 ( ZNF684 ), rs2180911 ( ZNF335 ), and rs74517766 ( ZNF358 ). Additionally, as trans -eQTL we also found genotypes rs1063632 and rs1051785 sign i cant ly affected the expression of  ZNF207 , while rs 148991762 and rs 139929471 sign i cant ly affected the expression of  ZNF684 . Changes in ZNFs are associated with neuro degenerative disorders. These ZNF proteins can also be used as predictive markers for different diseases such as cancer. ZNFs can also act as chromatin modiﬁers and cofactors affecting gene regulation at a broader level.  

A prevailing thought for years placed more importance on the impact of  cis -eQTL in which the SNP was close to the expressed gene. However, growing evidence suggests expression of a typical gene is associated with large numbers of  trans -eQTL, which by current estimates

may account for up to   $70\%$   of heritability. Studies using Hi-C and eQTL corroborate our results that show regions containing the regulatory SNP do not necessarily interact with or inﬂuence expression of the nearest  

– 32   gene. There is still a large gap in understanding of the contribution of  trans -eQTLs to complex disorders as most of these disease-causing SNPs are still unknown and understudied.  

The data presented here suggest a role for  trans-eQTL after stroke. We identiﬁed many SNP-gene pairs that linked expression of the gene to the speciﬁc genotype. Notably, there were often many  trans -eQTL/multiple SNPs that inﬂuenced expression of a single gene and similarly single trans -eQTL/SNPs sometimes inﬂuenced expression of a number of genes. The most signiﬁcant trans -eQTL was  ANOS1  (anosmin 1) (Table 3). ANOS1 mutations are associated with Kallmann syndrome (anosmia and hypo gona do tropic hypo gonad is m). During development ANOS1 works as a che mo tropic cue contributing to axonal outgrowth and collateral iz ation, and modulating the migration and proliferation of different cell types including neurons and oli god end ro cyte s. Thus, ANOS1 may play a role in recovery following stroke.  

We have previously investigated differences in X-chromosome gene expression between men and women with   ischemic stroke. Several  cis - and  trans -eQTL in our study show that variants in the X-chromosome contribute to changes in expression of nearby and distant genes. Among  cis -eQTLs, rs2738360 (G/A) was correlated with the expression of (GTP binding protein 6 putative) GTPBP6  that was differential ly expressed between 5h ischemic stroke and controls in our previous study. Regarding  trans -eQTL, we found SNP rs950391 (G/A) affected the expression of premature ovarian failure ( POF1B ) that was expressed differential ly between 24h ischemic stroke and controls in our previous study.  

Two other genes identiﬁed as differential ly expressed between ischemic stroke and control patients in our previous studies are now shown to be eQTL. The  trans -eQTL genes including  CCL2  (chemokine (C-C motif)) and UGCG  (UDP-glucose ceramide g lu co syl transfer as e) were differential ly expressed between ischemic stroke and control patients  $(\mathrm{FDR}<0.05$  , fold change >| 1.5 | ). Some trans -eQTL SNPs affect expression of multiple genes in trans , of which some are altered in individuals after   stroke. For example, the X-linked SNP rs950391 (G/A), was associated with altered gene expression of  ABCA6 , CLNK, EML6, POF1B,  and  WNT16 . These X-linked SNPgene pairs may account for aspects of sexual dimorphism in stroke in particular related to aspects of X-linked inactivation and dosing effects of related genes or alleles.  

The majority of stroke eQTL SNPs are located in noncoding regions of the genome (Tables 2, 3 and 4). Noncoding variants play a major role in the genetics of com  plex traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed associations with stroke and stroke subtypes, but have yet to assess stroke diagnosis-dependent – 43   eQTL. An analysis of genome-wide association data from 19,602 white persons showed two intergenic SNPs on chromosome 12p13 is associated with an increase of  

risk of stroke. A multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of 520,000 subjects identiﬁed 32 loci associated   with stroke and stroke subtype. Given differences in study cohorts, screening platforms, and analysis workﬂows, it is unsurprising that we did not ﬁnd much overlap in variants. However, of the 32 SNPs reported by Malik  et al ., (2018) four were included in our variant set. Three of the four overlapping variants (rs3184504, rs12037987, and rs635634) had associations   $\mathrm{(p<0.05)}$  with nine gene transcripts, highlighting the importance of the identiﬁed SNPs and suggesting that they may inﬂuence the transcriptional response to ischemic stroke (Supplementary Table S1).  

Another GWAS discovered one signiﬁcant variant and several variants with suggestive association with outcome and recovery three months after incidence of stroke. Furthermore, another study conducted by the NINDSSiGN consortium discovered novel loci associated with ischemic stroke and its subtypes of European descent. Recent meta-analysis of GWAS in 71,128 individuals looking at carotid artery intima media thickness (cIMT), and 48,434 individuals for carotid plaque traits, identiﬁed 16 loci sign i cant ly associated with either cIMT or carotid   plaque, of which nine were novel. Both cIMT and carotid plaque traits are relevant for large vessel ischemic stroke. A Dutch population-speciﬁc SNP imputation study identiﬁed an ABCA6 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A (ABC1), member 6) variant associated with   cholesterol levels. We found several other variants associated with ABCA6 in our study, namely rs950391, rs2464504, rs11758921, rs2369519, rs17409498, rs79434685, rs6665585, and rs117781420, suggesting variants associated with speciﬁc traits of interest may be pop  ulation-speciﬁc. ABCA6 is a membrane transporter likely involved in macrophage/leukocyte lipid/cholesterol homeostasis.  

Since genes with trait-relevant function only contribute   a small fraction of total disease risk, it seems reasonable that we found many eQTLs that were not reported in previous GWAS studies. Findings such as ours can provide deeper insight into the contribution of genetic variants to path o physiological response to stroke and facilitate better genetic understanding and prediction of stroke outcomes related to  cis  and  trans  effects on gene expression. Association of rare and ultra-rare variants to disease is becoming more apparent as the breadth of knowledge expands. The exact mechanisms by which small changes in genetic variation aggregate to exert speciﬁc inﬂuence over speciﬁc gene expression effects remain unknown.  

A number of our stroke eQTL have also been reported in other eQTL analyses highlighting their inﬂuence by genetic characteristics. In blood, NRGN , CXCL10 , SMAD4 ,  CD38 ,  ITGA1 ,  KLK15 ,  COX15 ,  TTK ,  WSB2 , ZNF358 ,  FOXRED2 ,  LILRA4 ,  SECISBP2 ,  SPHK2 ,  UGCG, SLC16A4, ZFAT, ABCA6, AP3B2, TTC21A, PTPRC, TLR3,GLDC, ZBTB16, ZNF207, C5, LAMP3, CCL2,  and  PUS7 have been reported as blood eQTL (Tables 2, 3 and 4). Moreover,  NRGN ,  PPP1R37 ,  UBXN7 ,  ITGA1 ,  RADIL , SPHK2 ,  ABL1 ,  IGFLR1 ,  COX15 ,  RTN4IP1 ,  NDUFA3 , MTSS1L ,  WSB2 ,  ZNF358 ,  SECISBP2 ,  FOXRED2 ,  UGCG , RAPGEF5,ABCA6,AP3B2,EML6,ZFAT,TTC21A,SMAD4 ,  GLDC ,  ZNF207 ,  MORN2 ,  PUS7 , and  ZBTB16 genes have been reported as brain eQTL (Tables 2, 3 and   4). Using the GRASP database, we found that expression of  ITGA1 ,  RAPGEF5 ,  CD38 ,  ZBTB16 ,  C5  and  ZNF   gene family genes are associated with stroke. In addition, some stroke/cardiovascular disease risk factor SNPs including rs3776738, rs11809423, rs10958734, rs7250947, rs6662611, and rs2195310, identiﬁed in Tables 2, 3 and 4 overlapped with eQTL SNPs reported in the literature.  

It is important to consider that our study examined the expression response in whole blood of IS patients. The components that make up whole blood, including immune cell subtypes, vesicles, and more, have important roles and responses to injury and also speciﬁc gene expression proﬁles that could be masked in whole blood analysis. Differential ly expressed transcripts found in whole blood show enrichment of genes associated with monocyte- or neutrophil-speciﬁc in amma tory and 51 immune response to IS   . Two of the relevant genes we identify in eQTL here,  NRGN  and  CXCL10  ( cis -eQTL genes), have the highest expression levels in monocytes compared to other cell types based on the Human Blood 52 Atlas   . Future work will determine whether individual components of whole blood are preferred targets over strategies that more broadly affect the overall aggregate response, yet understanding candidate sources of key expressed transcripts is essential.  

In summary, this genome-wide study examines and reveals the effect of genotype    $\times$   diagnosis on gene expression of blood after IS. These eQTLs could play a role in post-ischemic stroke injury or recovery. The suggestion that the speciﬁc in amma tory response to stroke in each individual is at least partially inﬂuenced by genetic variation has implications for progressing towards personalized treatment strategies. Treatments guided by speciﬁc genetic architecture could help pinpoint the pathways and proteins most likely to be prominent and spec i call y activated or in activated and thus could be modulated to improve outcome with fewer off target effects.  

Additional studies of an independent cohort with large sample sizes are needed to validate the current ﬁndings. Future studies will also need to stratify the stroke eQTL by diagnosis subtype, since many of the genetic risk factors for stroke differ according to stroke subtype. Since the QTLs vary considerably between tissues and cell types and sex, eQTL analysis of different blood cell types of both sexes could provide insight into how risk loci inﬂuence disease susceptibility and response. While we included factors known to highly impact gene expression in our statistical model, any factors not included (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, alcohol consumption, or others that were not measured) may also inﬂuence gene expression in our subjects to some degree. The future work examining the above relationships will help determine treatment strategies to improve stroke outcome.
