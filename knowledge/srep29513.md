No coding sequence variants of the  ALOX5AP  gene that lead to amino acid substitutions have been  identified. A two-stage study design was used to explore the relationship between variants in the  transcriptional regulatory region of  ALOX5AP  gene and ischemic stroke (IS) risk in Chinese populations.  IS was determined using CT and/or MRI. First, 18 SNPs, located in the upstream promoter region of  ALOX5AP  gene, were genotyped in 200 IS patients and 200 controls. And one potential associated SNP  (rs17222919) was identified   $(P\!=\!0.005,O R\!=\!0.623$  , 95%  CI : 0.448\~0.866). Next, another independent  case-control cohort comprising 810 IS patients and 825 matched controls was recruited to investigate  the role of rs17222919, rs9579646 polymorphisms and their haplotypes in IS risk. The G allele frequency  of rs17222919 in the IS group was significantly lower than that in control group   $(P\!=\!0.007$  ,  $\scriptstyle0R=0.792,$    95%  CI : 0.669\~0.937). T-A and G-A haplotypes were associated with IS   $(P\!=\!0.001,O R\!=\!1.282,$     95%  CI :1.100\~1.495;  $\pmb{P}\!=\!\pmb{0.0001}$  ,  $O R\!=\!0.712$  ,  $\pmb{95\%}$    CI : 0.598\~0.848; respectively). Our study provides  evidence that rs17222919 is a potential genetic protective factor against IS. Furthermore, the T-A  haplotype is a risk factor and the G-A haplotype is a protective factor against IS in Chinese population.  

Ischemic stroke (IS), also called cerebral infarction (CI), is a complex multi factorial disorder characterized by the  sudden loss of blood circulation to an area of the brain, resulting in a corresponding loss of neurologic function 1 .  Previous studies have suggested that inflammation is a key element in all critical steps of atherosclerosis, which  underlies the pathogen es is of cardiovascular disease and   $\mathrm{IS}^{2}$  . The 5-lip oxygen as e-activating protein (FLAP),  which is encoded by the  ALOX5AP  gene, is a crucial regulator of the biosynthesis of leu kotri ene s (LTs), which can  lead to the accumulation of LTs in fatty deposits on the arterial wall 3 . LTs initiate leukocyte activation and promote the adhesion of monocytes on the vascular wall, a process that plays an important role in the pathogen es is  of atherosclerosis and inflammatory diseases, including IS 4 .  

To date, most genetic studies have focused on the relationship between two at-risk haplotypes (HapA and  HapB) of the  ALOX5AP  gene and the susceptibility to IS. However, the association results were inconsistent and  controversial across different ethnic backgrounds 5–7 . In particular, no coding sequence variants of the  ALOX5AP   gene that lead to amino acid substitutions have been identified 8 . Domingues-Montanari  et al.  reported that the  SG13S114 genotypes modulate the mRNA levels of  ALOX5AP  gene and the mRNA levels were higher in IS cases  than in controls. Helga do ttir  et al.  revealed that the   $A L O X5A P$   gene expression levels and its downstream leukotriene  $\mathrm{B_{4}}$     $\mathrm{(LTB_{4})}$  ) synthesis activity were greater in IS patients than in controls. Kim  et al.  previously reported  that a promoter polymorphism (rs17222919) was associated with the development of intra cerebral hemorrhage in  the Korean population. Ji RJ  et al. , also reported that another promoter polymorphism ( − ​581_582 Ins A ) might  be a novel genetic risk factor for IS in a north Chinese Han population. These phenomena strongly suggested

that there might be some additional unidentified variants in the regulatory regions of the  ALOX5AP  gene may  play modulate IS risk. However, the relationship between polymorphisms throughout the entire transcriptional  regulatory region of the  ALOX5AP  gene and IS risk has not been extensively explored.  

Therefore, a two-stage study design was used to explore the relationship between variants of  $A L O X5A P$   gene  and IS risk in two independent Chinese Han cohorts. Firstly, we selected 18 SNPs that cover the promoter region  of the  AlOX5AP  gene to screen the positive SNPs using SNaPshot mini sequence technique. Subsequently, we  investigated the role of rs17222919 (in the promoter region) and rs9579646 (in the first intron region) polymorphisms in IS risk using TaqMan-PCR technique in a larger cohort from the Chinese Han population.  

# Results  

Subject characteristics.  The clinical and demographic characteristics of the two populations are shown in  Table 1. Cases and controls were well matched in age and sex (  $\scriptstyle P\geq0.004$  ;  $P\!>\!0.025$  ). Compared with the control  groups, the IS groups showed higher percentages of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking (  $\!\!\!\!^{\circ}P\!<\!0.004$  ;   $\!\bar{P}\!<\!0.025)$  ). IS patients also had significantly higher total cholesterol (TC) and total triglycerides (TG) levels than  the control subjects (  $\scriptstyle\left(P\,<\,0.004\right.$  ;  $P\!<\!0.025$  ).  

The preliminary screening results in the initial study.  Association analysis of 18 SNPs in the promoter  region of ALOX5AP with IS .  The   $-1785\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  ,  $-946\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G},$  ,  − ​581_582lnsA,  $-519\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  ,  $-290\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   and  $-190\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$    were not polymorphic in our initial study. The genotype distributions of rs12560847, rs9578195, rs61947373,  rs34404999, rs55950839, rs55780307, rs59227506, rs34536374, rs34344566, rs9578194 and rs34352240 were consistent with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, but showed no significant differences between IS patients and  controls   $(P\!>\!0.004)$  .  

For the rs17222919 polymorphism, the G allele frequency was significantly lower in IS group   $(19.5\%)$  ) than in  control group   $(28.0\%)$  ) (  $\stackrel{\textstyle}{\boldsymbol{P}}=\!0.005$  ;  $O R=\!0.623$  ,  $95\%$    CI : 0.448\~0.866). See Table 2.  

Haplotype analysis of the ALOX5AP promoter region.   After the non-polymorphic loci were removed, linkage d is equilibrium (LD) test was performed and the results were shown in Fig. 1. The rs34536374, rs34344566,  rs34352240, rs9578194, rs55950839, rs55780307, rs59227506 and rs12560847 were in strong linkage disequilibrium and haplotype blocks (  $D^{\circ}\!>\!0.8,$  ) were defined. Because rs17222919 was not in strong linkage d is equilibrium   $\scriptstyle\left(D^{\circ}<0.8\right)$  , the haplotype blocks were defined without rs17222919. The distribution of haplotype (CACGTATG)  and haplotype (TGTAAGCA) has no significant difference between IS group and control group (  $\!\!\!(P\!=\!0.037)\!\!\!$  ). See  Table 3.  

Association between the rs17222919 and rs9579646 polymorphisms and IS in the second  cohort.  Association analysis and inherited model test .  The genotype frequency distributions of rs17222919  and rs9579646 were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the second cohort. After adjusting  for conventional risk factors, the  $\mathrm{G}$   allele frequency   $(19.3\%)$   in the IS group was found to be significantly lower  than that  $(23.2\%)$   in the control group (  $P\!=\!0.007$  ,  $O R\,{=}\,0.792$  ,   $95\%$   $5\%\;\bar{C I}\!=\!0.669\!\sim\!0.937$  ). See Table 4. However,  the rs9579646 polymorphism showed no significant differences between the two groups   $(P\!>\!0.025)$  .To assess  the effect of rs17222919 on the risk of IS, we compared additive, dominant, and recessive models. The effect of  rs17222919 was best described with the dominant model (  $P\!=\!0.016$   $O R\,{=}\,0.778$  ,   $95\%$     $C I\!=\!0.637\!\sim\!\!0.951$  ). See  Table 5.  

Linkage d is equilibrium test and haplotype analysis.   Linkage d is equilibrium test indicated that rs17222919 and  rs9579646 were in strong linkage d is equilibrium (  $\stackrel{\_}{D^{\circ}}=0.83\bar{7}$  ). Consequently, haplotype analysis was carried out.  Three common haplotypes (frequency  ${>}3\%$  ) in the cases and controls were presented in Table 6. There was a  statistically significant difference in the frequency of the G-A haplotype between the case and control groups   $\scriptstyle{P\;=\;0.0001}$  ,  $\bar{O R}\!=\!0.712$  ,  $95\%$    CI :  $0.598{-}0.848)$  ). The frequency of the T-A haplotype was higher in the IS group  than in the control group (  ${\cal P}\!=\!0.001$  ,   $O R=\!1.282$  ,   $95\%$    CI : 1.100\~1.495).

Adjusted  $P$   value   $\scriptstyle(P\,<\,0.004)$   indicates statistical  significance.

# Discussion  

Promoter elements have fundamental roles in regulating gene transcription. Altering the DNA sequence of a  promoter may result in changes in transcription factor binding sites or binding rates. Thus, a single nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region can affect promoter activity by altering the binding affinity of transcription factors involved in the regulation of gene expression . In the present study, we designed a two-stage  study to explore the relationship between variants in the transcriptional regulatory region of the  ALOX5AP  gene  and IS risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is a comprehensive study to evaluate whether polymorphisms in  the transcriptional regulatory region of  ALOX5AP  gene could influence susceptibility to IS in a large Han Chinese  population.  

Firstly, 18 SNPs that cover the promoter region of the  ALOX5AP  gene were selected using SNaPshot method  to screen positive SNPs. The results showed that  $-1785\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A},$  ,  $-946\bar{\mathrm{A}}{>}\mathrm{G}$  ,  − ​581_582lnsA,   $-519\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  ,   $-290\mathrm{G}\!>$  ​ A and  $-190\mathrm{G}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{A}$   loci were not polymorphic in our initial population. Our results were obviously different from  those reported by Ji RJ  et al. , who reported that three genetic variants were identified, including a mutation  

  $\left(-519\,\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{A}\right)$  , an insertion and deletion polymorphism   $(-581_{-}582\,\mathrm{Ins\,A})$   and a single nucleotide polymorphism 

  $(-946\;\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{G})$  . They also reported that the  − ​581_582 Ins A polymorphism might be a novel genetic risk factor  for IS in a north Chinese Han population. The discrepancy between their findings and those of our study may  be attributed to the differences in sample size. Therefore, further study with a larger population is required to  confirm the findings. Next, the genotype distributions of 11 SNPs, including rs12560847, rs9578195, rs61947373,  rs34404999, rs55950839, rs55780307, rs59227506, rs34536374, rs34344566, rs9578194 and rs34352240 were  

![](images/794e048ff5c9ecb5a4aa444c48563b4ee99a3a89690605008165e8d298b8b6fd.jpg)  
Figure 1.    The results of linkage d is equilibrium tests for the twelve analyzed SNPs (The order is rs34536374,  rs34344566, rs34352240, rs9578194, rs55950839, rs55780307, rs59227506, rs34404999, rs12560847, rs9578195,   rs61947373 and rs17222919 from left to right).  

consistent with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium but showed no significant differences between IS and controls   $(P\!>\!0.004)$  ). However, the G allele frequency of rs17222919 was significantly different between the IS and  control groups (  $P\!=\!0.005$  ;  $O R\,{=}\,0.623$  ,  $95\%$    CI : 0.448\~0.866). If the adjusted  $P$   value for significance was set at   $0.05/12\!=\!0.004$   in the initial cohort by Bonferroni’s adjustment, the  $P$   value of rs17222919 (0.005) was close to  the statistical significance. So we thought it was a potentially associate locus.Therefore, the rs17222919 was identified to have a potentially positive association with IS in the first-stage study and was to be replicated in a larger  Chinese Han cohort.  

Haplotype analysis is considered more powerful than single SNP analysis to search for genetic determinants  of complex diseases 15 . After the non-polymorphic loci were excluded, LD test was performed. The results indicated that rs34536374, rs34344566, rs34352240, rs9578194, rs55950839, rs55780307, rs59227506 and rs12560847  were in strong linkage d is equilibrium   $(D'\!>\!0.8)$   and haplotype blocks were defined. The 8 SNPs constituted a  total of 22 common potential haplotypes in the patients and controls. And the most frequent haplotype was  Hap(CACGTATG). The frequency of haplotype (CACGTATG) was significantly higher in the IS patients than  in controls   $\left(P\!=\!0.037,\!O R\!=\!I.540,\right.$  ,  $95\%$    CI :1.024\~2.314). The frequency of haplotype (TGTAAGCA) was significantly lower in the IS patients than in controls   $(P\!=\!0.037,\!O R\!=\!0.650$  ,  $95\%$    CI :0.432\~0.976). However, both of  the two haplotypes didn’t reach the statistical significance. Further study with a larger population is required to  evaluate the findings.  

Preliminary studies have revealed that the introns have important biological functions. In particular, the first  introns of human genes are likely to be involved in transcriptional regulation . Thus, in the second larger  Chinese cohort, we investigated the role of rs17222919 (in the promoter region) and rs9579646 (in the first  intron region) polymorphisms in IS risk using TaqMan-PCR technique. For the rs17222919 polymorphism, the  G allele frequencies of IS group   $(19.3\%)$   were significantly lower than in the control group   $(23.2\%)$   (  $\left(P=0.007\right)$  ).  Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the G allele was associated with a 0.792-fold increased risk  of IS after adjusting for conventional risk factors (  $95\%$    CI ,   $0.669{\sim}0.937$  ;   $P\!=\!0.007$  ). Rs17222919 was associated  with IS in a dominant genetic model   $(P<\!0.025)$  ) after performing genotype association tests with dominant,  recessive and additive models. However, this association was inconsistent with the results previously reported by  Kim  et al. , who showed that rs17222919 was associated with intra cerebral hemorrhage, but not IS, in a Korean  population. Our previous i n vitro  promoter assay revealed that the G allele had a lower transcriptional activity  than the T allele, suggesting that the   $-1316\mathrm{T}/\mathrm{G}$   variation reduces  ALOX5AP  promoter activity and consequently  down-regulates gene expression. The decreased  ALOX5AP  transcription results in increased in activation of the  5-LO pathway and reduces leu kotri ene biosynthesis, which in turn protects from   $\mathrm{IS}^{18}$  . The rs9579646 polymorphism showed no significant differences between groups and was not associated with IS in our second Chinese  cohort.  

Finally, the linkage d is equilibrium test and haplotype analysis were performed using SHEsis software. The  rs17222919 and rs9579646 polymorphisms were in complete linkage d is equilibrium (  $\langle D'\!=\!0.837$  ). The frequency of the G-A haplotype was lower in the IS group than in the controls   ${\it P}\,{=}\,0.0001)$  ), suggesting that the  G-A haplotype might be a genetic protective factor against IS in the Chinese Han population (  $\bar{O R}\,{=}\,0.712$  ,    $95\%$    CI : 0.598–0.848). Conversely, the T-A haplotype was associated with an increased risk of IS (  $.O R\,{=}\,1.282$  ,    $95\%\,C I{:}1.100{\sim}1.495)$  ) and the T-A haplotype might be a risk factor for IS in this Chinese Han cohort. Furthermore,  the G-G haplotype frequencies were quite low, and this haplotype thus had less impact on the incidence of IS.  

Several limitations of our study need to be addressed. First, the sample size of the initial study (200 cases  and 200 controls) may not be sufficiently large to screen all the potential risk-associated SNPs and evaluate

gene–environment interactions. Second, there was potential selection bias because the cases and controls were  recruited from hospital. Third,  ALOX5AP  mRNA levels among different rs17222919 genotypes were not compared in either the IS or control group.  

In conclusion, we designed a two-stage study to explore the relationship between variants in transcriptional  regulatory region of the  $\bar{A L O X5A P}$   gene and IS. In the first stage, 18 SNPs covering the promoter region of the  ALOX5AP  gene were screened and one potential risk-associated SNP (rs17222919) was selected. In the second  larger Chinese cohort, we confirmed that the rs17222919 polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk  of IS. In addition, two haplotypes were discovered to be associated with IS. Future studies of the variants in the  transcriptional regulatory region of  ALOX5AP  and their biological functions should be conducted to further  elucidate the etiology of IS.  

# Methods  

Study populations.  In the initial study, 200 IS patients (112 men and 88 women, mean age   $57.2\pm7.2$   years)  were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. In the second cohort, a total of 810  patients with ischemic stroke (males: females  $=416{:}394$  , mean age  $57.7\pm8.6$   years) were enrolled from Henan  Provincial Hospital in central China. None of the participants were included in both populations. The IS was  defined by a loss of global or focal cerebral function persisting for  ${>}24\,\mathrm{h}$   with corresponding infarction on brain  imaging with a probable vascular cause 19 . IS cases were classified into three subtypes, namely large-artery athero sclerosis (LAA), small-artery occlusion lacunar (SAO), and stroke of other undetermined etiology (SUE),  according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) 20 . Brain imaging was carried out using  computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as ancillary diagnostic investigations and standardized blood tests were also performed. Patients with atrial fibrillation, cerebral hemorrhage,  peripheral vascular diseases, or kidney diseases were excluded from the study.  

The control groups consisted of 200 (initial study: 106 men and 94 women, mean age  $55.9\pm7.0$   years) and 825  (second study: 428 men and 397 women, mean age   $55.3\pm7.2$   years) unrelated Henan Han individuals, selected  from the same demographic area and matched to the cases by age, sex, and residency. All controls were free of  cerebro vascular disease, cardiovascular disease, hepatic disease, renal disease and cancer.  

The study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research of Zhengzhou University  and informed written consent was obtained from each participant. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.  

Preliminary screening for positive SNPs by SNaPshot.  Because promoter elements have key roles  in regulating gene transcription, we selected 18 SNPs covering the promoter region of  ALOX5AP  gene for initial analysis. The  $-1785\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  ,   $-946\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$  ,  − ​581_582lnsA,   $-519\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  ,  $-290\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   and  $-190\mathrm{G}\!>\!\mathrm{A}$   were selected  based on previously reported significant associations. The rs12560847, rs9578195, rs61947373, rs17222919,  rs34404999, rs55950839, rs55780307, rs59227506, rs34536374, rs34344566, rs9578194 and rs34352240 were

selected based on pairwise  $r^{2}\left(>0.8\right)$   among all common SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF)  ${>}0.1$   spanning  the promoter region of the  $A l O X5A P$   gene using the Haploview 4.0 software 21 .  

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral white blood cells of 200 pairs case and control participants  using the Blood Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen Biotechnology, Union City, CA, USA) according to the  manufacturer’s instructions. Touch-down PCR amplifications was performed using 7 pairs of primers (Sangon,  Shanghai, China). All primers were designed using the primer3 program (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/ primer3/primer 3 www.cgi). All samples were genotyped using SNaPshot mini sequence technique.  

A   $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   mixture containing 1x HotStarTaq buffer,  $3.0\,\mathrm{{mM}\,\mathrm{{Mg}^{2+}}}$  ,   $0.3\,\mathrm{mM}$   dNTP, 1U HotStarTaq polymerase  (Qiagen),   $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   multiple PCR primers and   $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   template DNA was prepared for each reaction. The cycling program was  $95\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 2 mins; 11 cycles of  $94\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $20\,s,$  ,   $(62\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}-0.5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{e}$  cycle) for  $40\,s$  ,  $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 1.5 mins; 24 cycles of   ${\bar{9}}4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20 s,  $57\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\,s,$     $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1.5\,\mathrm{{mins}}$  ; and  $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 2 mins. To eliminate excess primers and dNTPs, 5U  SAP (Promega, USA) and 2U Exo I (Epicentre, Palmerston North, New Zealand) were added to the   $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   PCR  products. The mixture was incubated at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 60 mins, followed by incubation at   $75\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $15\,\mathrm{{mins}}$  .  

Eighteen extension primers were designed for multiplex PCR SNaPshot reaction. The reaction mixture  included  $5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   SNaPshot Multiplex reaction mix (Applied biosystems, USA),  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O}$  ,   $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   extension primer  mix and  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   purified PCR product. The cycling program was  $96\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\,\mathrm{{min}}$  ; 28 cycles of   $96\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 10 s,   $55\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  5 s and  $60\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,s$  . In order to purify the extension products, 1U SAP (Promega, USA) was added to extension  product and incubated at   $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 60 mins, followed by incubation at   $75\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 15 mins. Finally, a mixture of   $9\,\upmu$  ​ L HiDi Formamide,   $0.5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   Liz120 size standard and  $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   purified extension product were denatured at  $95\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  5 mins and then loaded onto an ABI3730xl instrument (ABI, USA) and Gene Mapper 4.1 (Applied biosystems,  USA) was run to analyze the results.  

Genotyping of rs17222919 and rs9579646 polymorphisms.  The preliminary screening results  showed that only rs17222919 in the  ALOX5AP  gene promoter region had a significantly different frequency in  the IS and control groups. Moreover, the first introns of human genes are likely to be involved in transcriptional  regulation. Thus, in the second cohort, we selected rs17222919 which was positively associated with IS in the  preliminary study and rs9579646 which is located in the first intron of the  ALOX5AP  gene for analysis.  

EDTA anti-coagulated venous blood samples were collected from the 810 enrolled IS patients and 825 healthy  controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood using the Blood Genomic DNA Miniprep  Kit (Axygen Biotechnology, Union City, CA, USA). TaqMan probes were used to analyze rs17222919 and  TaqMan-MGB probes were selected to genotype rs9579646 polymorphism respectively. The genotype was determined according to the relative fluorescence intensity of the probe detected by the real-time PCR system (ABI  PRISM 7500; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each PCR reaction mixture   $(10\,\upmu\mathrm{L})$   contained  $5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of   $2\times$  TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems),  $0.2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   forward primer,  $0.2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   reverse primer,  $0.6\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$    FAM-labeled probe,   $0.6\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   HEX-labeled probe,   $0.4\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   ROXII,   $1.0\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of DNA template   $\left(1{\sim}20\,\mathrm{ng}/\upmu\mathrm{L}\right)$  , and  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$     $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O}$  . In each assay, three samples with known genotypes and three no-DNA blank controls were included.  The PCR reaction conditions consisted of pre-degeneration for 2 mins at  $95\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$   followed de natura tion at  $95\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $15\;s,$   and 40 cycles of annealing and extension at  $60\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\;s.$  . After PCR amplification, sample genotypes were  determined by measuring the allele-specific fluorescence with an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System and  using SDS 1.7 software for allele discrimination (Applied Biosystems). To verify the genotyping accuracy,   $10\%$   of  random samples were sequenced.  

Statistical analysis.  All statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 17.0 package (SPSS Inc., Chicago,  IL, USA). Pearson’s chi-squared test was used to test for differences in qualitative variables and genotype/allele  frequencies. Differences in quantitative variables between groups were analyzed using Student’s  t -test. Testing for  deviation of genotype distribution from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and a haplotype-based case-control study  were performed using SHEsis software (http://analysis.bio-x.cn) 22 . Odds ratios ( OR s),   $95\%$   confidence intervals   $\hphantom{0}{.95\%}$    CI s) and corresponding   $P$   values for IS risk were calculated by logistic regression analysis after adjusting  for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking and biochemical indexes such as TC and TG levels. Bonferroni’s adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. The adjusted  $P$   value for significance was set at   $0.05/12\!=\!0.004$   in the initial cohort and the adjusted  $P$   value less than 0.025 were considered statistically significant in the second cohort.
