Abstract.  Stroke represents the leading cause of disability  and mortality amongst the elderly worldwide. Multiple risk  factors, including both genetic and non‑genetic components,  as well as their interactions, are proposed as e tio logical  factors involved in the development of ischemic stroke (IS).  Promoter polymorphisms of the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C (rs1800795) and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A (rs1800629) genes have been considered as  predictive risk factors of IS; however, these have not yet been  evaluated in a Thai population. The aims of this study were to  investigate the association of  IL‑6 ‑174G/C and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A  polymorphisms with IS. Genomic DNA from 200 patients  with IS and 200 controls were genotyped for  IL‑6 ‑174G/C and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphisms using TaqMan™ SNP geno­ typing and quantitative PCR‑high resolution melting analysis,  respectively. It was found that the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 A allele was  significantly associated with an increased risk of IS develop­ ment compared with the G allele [odds ratio   $\mathrm{(OR)}{=}2.044$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.154{-}3.620$  ;   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.0}$  14]. Moreover, the IS risk was  significantly higher in the presence of  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 GA or AA  genotypes compared with that in the presence of GG genotypes  with a dominant inheritance   $\mathrm{\operatorname{OR}}{=}1.971$  ;  $95\%$   CI=1.080‑3.599;   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.027}$  ). However, there was no association between   $I L\cdot6{-}174\mathrm{G/C}$   and the risk of IS development. The interac­ tion study demonstrated that  IL‑6 ‑174 GG and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑ 308  GG genotypes enhanced IS susceptibility when combined  with hypertension, hyper lipid emi a and alcohol consumption.  Hypertensive and hyper lipid emi c subjects with the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308  GA and AA genotypes were more likely to develop IS  compared with those who did not have these two conditions  and had the GG genotype. In a matched study design (1:1), the  IL‑6 ‑174 GC genotype was associated with higher IL‑6 levels  in the control group. Collectively, the present results highlight  the utility of the  TNF‑  $\cdot\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphism as a predictive  genetic risk factor for development of IS.  

# Introduction  

Stroke is a significant cause of disability and mortality in the  elderly   $({\geq}65$   years) worldwide (1). Moreover, stroke incidence  and mortality rates remain high in young adults (18‑50 years)  in developing and developed countries alike (2,3). In Thailand,  the incidence of stroke‑associated mortality per 100,000 indi­ viduals has continued to increase, reaching  $53.0\%$   in 2019, up  from   $47.1\%$   in 2017 and   $47.8\%$   in 2018 (4). Ischemic stroke  (IS), involving the occlusion of a major cerebral artery or its  branches in the brain, is the primary type of stroke globally (3).  The development of stroke is affected by the interaction  between multiple risk factors, involving both genetic and  non‑genetic factors (5,6). Chronic inflammatory diseases and  unhealthy lifestyle habits are the most common risk factors  associated with stroke (6). The inflammatory component has  been considered as one of the possible e tio logical factors in  the early stages of IS development, thereby promoting the  formation of a cerebral thrombus in association with the endo­ thelium and coagulation (7). After cerebral ischemia, a robust  inflammatory response is triggered by ischemic neuronal cell  death and the release of necrotic cell debris, which induces  the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines  from microglia and macrophage cells (8‑10). A dys regulated  immune response, accompanied by an increased number of  inflammatory cells, high TNF‑  $\cdot\alpha$   production and the activation  of microglia cells has been shown to enhance neuro in fl amma­ tion and exacerbate ischemic brain injury in patients with IS  and a mouse model of cerebral ischemia (11). Inflammatory  cytokines and chemokines have been used as predictors of  stroke incidence and outcomes (12,13). Thus, the genetic varia­ tion of inflammatory cytokine genes has become a critical  issue in research relating to the predictive risk factors of IS  occurrence (14,15), as well as its severity and outcome (16), and  this provides potential therapeutic options for the treatment of  inflammatory diseases (17,18).  

IL‑6 and TNF‑  $\alpha$   are potent pro‑inflammatory cytokines  that serve vital roles in the immune response during inflam­ mation (19). IL‑6 levels have been suggested as a potential  biomarker that is associated with stroke outcomes  (20),  short‑term acute ischemic stroke death (21) and post‑stroke  dementia (22). It has also been shown that the over expression  of TNF‑  $\upalpha$   transcripts is an independent risk factor for the inci­ dence of IS (13). Furthermore, high TNF‑  $\cdot\alpha$   levels post‑stroke  are associated with poor patient outcomes (23).  

Single‑nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most  commonly studied genetic variations for IS susceptibility (24),  and functional SNPs located in a gene's promoter region  regulate that gene's transcriptional expression (25,26). A  meta‑analysis revealed that the   $I L\mathbf{-}6\mathbf{-}174\mathrm{G/C}$   polymorphism  was significantly associated with IS risk in Asian popula­ tions in both dominant and recessive inheritance models (14).  However, other studies reported that the  $I L\mathbf{-}6\mathbf{-}174\mathbf{G}/\mathbf{C}$   poly­ morphism was not associated with the risk of IS in North  Indian (16,27) and Chinese populations (28). Moreover, no  association of the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C polymorphism was observed  with the expression levels of IL‑6 in the plasma of patients  with IS and controls (29). With regard to  TNF‑  $\alpha$   gene, it was  found that the  TNF ‑ α ‑308G/A polymorphism was associated  with a risk of IS development (15) and hypertension (30) in  an Asian population. In addition,  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 GA genotypes  may be protective factors for IS occurrence in East Asian  populations (31,32).  

However, there remains considerable controversy  surrounding the two SNPs,  IL‑6 ‑174G/C and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A,  which are located in the promoter region of the gene (14‑16,32).  These may be predictive risk factors of IS development and  modify the gene's transcriptional activities, thereby contrib­ uting to changes in the gene's expression levels. Presumably,  the association between these two SNPs and IS risk may be  attributed to different ethnicities, environmental influences  and experimental design. To the best of our knowledge, there  have been no reports on the association of   $I L\mathbf{-}6\mathbf{-}174\mathrm{G/C}$   and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphisms with the risk of IS and the  expression levels of IL‑6 and TNF‑  $\cdot\alpha$   in Thailand. Therefore,  the present study aimed to investigate the association between  IL‑6 ‑174G/C and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphisms with IS  susceptibility, their interactions with clinical variables and  the expression levels of IL‑6 and TNF‑  $\alpha$   in a southern Thai  population.  

# Materials and methods  

Sample size calculation.  A sample size calculation was  performed using the freely available   $\mathbf{G}^{*}$  Power version 3.1.9.2  application power analysis (33). To achieve a power of   $95\%$  at an   $\alpha$   of 0.05, the sample size was calculated based on the  previous reports (14,15). The estimated sample sizes were  367 and 420 subjects for the   $I L–6$   and  TNF‑  $\alpha$   genotypes,  respectively.  

Study participants.  A total of 422 blood samples of  Thai‑Buddhist origin were collected from Thungchon,  Bansakha and Thaiburi sub‑district health promoting hospitals  and the Thasala Hospital (Thasala, Nakhon Si Thammarat,  Thailand) between November 2019 and August 2020. Patients  with IS were recruited based on the physician's diagnosis,  assessed using clinical symptoms, computed tomography  scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were all  medically stable and received the same class of drug regimens.  The controls were individuals from the same demographic who  attended a checkup, but had no history of stroke. Clinical infor­ mation, including age, sex, blood pressure, BMI, biochemical  parameters (blood sugar and lipid profile), smoking habit and  alcohol consumption, were collected from reviews of medical  records. Subjects were excluded if they had a history of inflam­ matory diseases, acute heart failure, myocardial infarction  (MI), hepatitis, cirrhosis, chronic renal failure and dialysis,  autoimmune diseases, immune‑suppress ive therapy or cancer.  Amongst the 422 subjects, 22 subjects did not fulfill the inclu­ sion criteria (Fig. 1). Finally, a total of 400 blood samples were  obtained for genotyping analyses. Samples were collected  from 200 patients with IS (106 males and 94 females; age  range 40‑97, median age 67 years) and 200 controls (123 males  and 77 females; age range 46‑94, median age 66 years). The  research protocols were performed in accordance with the  Declaration of Helsinki guidelines (34) and approved by the  Human Research Ethics Committee of Walailak University  (approval no.  WUEC‑19‑189‑01). Informed consent was  acquired from each participant in this study.  

Hypertension was defined as a resting systolic blood pres­ sure  ${\geq}140\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   and/or diastolic blood pressure  ${\geq}90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$  , or  a requirement of anti hypertensive drugs (35). Hyper lipid emi a  was defined as a total cholesterol level of   ${\geq}240\ \mathrm{mg/d1}$   or a  history of taking anti hyper lipid emi c drugs (36). Diabetes  mellitus was defined as a fasting plasma glucose level   ${\geq}126\,\mathrm{mg/d}1$   or current use of glycemic control medication (37).  Moreover, subjects that possessed  ${\geq}3$   of the following five risk  factors were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (38,39): BMI 

  ${\geq}27.0\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$   in men and  ${\geq}25.0\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$   in women; triglycerides of 

  ${\geq}150\;\mathrm{mg/d1}$  ; high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol   ${<}40\;\mathrm{mg/dl}$   in  men or  ${<}50\,\mathrm{mg/dl}$   in women; blood pressure  ${\geq}130/85\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   or  patients currently taking hypertensive medication; and fasting  plasma glucose levels of   ${\geq}100\ \mathrm{mg/d1}$   or patients currently  taking insulin or hypoglycemic medication. Smoking status  referred to subjects that were current smokers only. Subjects  were considered alcohol drinkers if they consumed   ${\geq}100~\mathrm{ml}$  alcohol  ${>}3$   times per week.  

IL‑6 and TNF‑  $\alpha$   genotyping.  Ethylene dia mine tetra‑acetic  acid blood samples of   $_{3-5\ \mathrm{ml}}$   from the patients with IS and  controls were collected only once at admission. Genomic  DNA was extracted and purified using a genomic DNA Mini  kit (Geneaid Biotech, Ltd.). Then, DNA concentration and  purity were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer  (NanoDrop   $\mathrm{On{e}^{C}}$  ; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and stored  at   $\mathrm{-}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until required for further analysis.  IL‑6 ‑174G/C  (rs1800795) genotyping was performed using a TaqMan™ SNP  Genotyping assay, available with probe and primers (assay ID:  C_1839697_20; cat. no. 4351379; Thermo Fisher Scientific,  Inc.). Genotyping reactions were performed in a 10‑µl reaction

volume and the amplification was conducted according to the  manufacturer's instructions as follows: Polymerase activation  at   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\ \mathrm{min}$  , followed by 50 cycles of de natura tion  at   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 15 sec and annealing/extension at   $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\ \mathrm{min}$  using a Step One Plus™ Real‑Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher  Scientific, Inc.). Data were analyzed using Step One Plus™  software (version 2.2.2; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).  

For  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A (rs1800629) genotyping, the primers  were designed using the Primer3 and BLAST software (ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer‑blast) from the National Center  for Biotechnology Information. The primer sequences were:  Forward,   $5^{\prime}.$  ‑CTG​GTC​CCC​AAA​AGA​AAT​GGA​G‑  $\cdot3^{\dagger}$   and  reverse,   $5^{\prime}$  ‑CTG​GGC​CAC​TGA​CTG​ATT​TGT​G‑  $.3^{\prime}$   (product  size,  $96~\mathrm{{bp}}$  ). The total volume of the PCR reaction was  $20\;\mu\mathrm{l}$  ,  which was composed of 1X HOT FIREPol ®  EvaGreen ®  HRM  mix (ROX) (cat. no. 08‑33‑00001; Solis BioDyne),   $250~\mathrm{nM}$  forward and reverse primers and  $20\,\mathrm{ng}$   DNA samples. A quanti­ tative‑(q)PCR was set up in a 96‑well PCR plate and processed  on a Quanstudio™ 5 Real‑Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher  Scientific, Inc.) with the following thermo cycling conditions:  Initial de natura tion at  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $15\,\mathrm{{min}}$  , followed by 40 cycles of  de natura tion at  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 15 sec, annealing at  $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20 sec and  elongation at   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20 sec. The melt curve protocol was set  as follows: De natura tion at  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 15 sec, re annealing at  $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$    for 20 sec and melting from   $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   to   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   with a ramp rate  of  $0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{sec}$  . Data were analyzed via high resolution melting  (HRM) curve analysis (version 3.1; Thermo Fisher Scientific,  Inc.). In total, 184 DNA samples were randomly analyzed for  the first round of examination using HRM software. Among  them, three different patterns of different plots were observed,  and the samples were selected for DNA sequencing. The DNA  sequencing results revealed   $100\%$   concordance with the results  of the HRM analyses. The three different genotypes obtained  from the first round were submitted as genotype controls and  included in each plate. The qPCR and HRM analyses were  reanalyzed for the first round of 184 samples and performed for  all DNA samples.  

DNA sequencing.  To validate the genotyping results of the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphisms, a random  selection of  $10\%$   of samples for re‑genotyping were subjected to  DNA sequencing (Apical Scientific Sdn. Bhd.). Before re‑geno­ typing, PCR amplification of the two SNPs was performed  using 5X FIREPol ®  MasterMix (cat. no. 04‑12‑00125; Solis  BioDyne). The  IL‑6 ‑174G/C polymorphism was amplified  using the redesigned forward primer, 5'‑GTA​AAA​CTT​CGT​

To iden­ tify the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 polymorphism, the following redesigned  primers were used: Forward, 5'‑GCC​CCT​CCC​AGT​TCT​AGT​ TC‑3' and reverse, 5'‑CAT​CAA​GGA​CCC​CTC​ACA​CTC‑3',  to obtain the extended PCR product size of   $225~\mathrm{top}$   for DNA  sequencing. The UCSC In‑Silico PCR online informatics  tool (genome.ucsc.edu/cgi‑bin/hgPcr) was used to create the  UCSC Genome Browser on Human Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38)  Assembly in order to visualize the position of the two poly­ morphisms in the predicted PCR product [Fig. 2A ( IL‑6 , upper  panel) and 2B ( TNF‑  $\alpha$  , upper panel)]. After initial activation  at   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $5\,\mathrm{min}$  , PCR cycling conditions of the two polymor­ phisms (  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 15 sec,   $54^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 sec and  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 sec)  were carried out for 30 cycles on a GeneAmp ®  PCR System  9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher  Scientific, Inc.). The presence of bands of the expected size  was confirmed via agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR products  were visualized on   $1.5\%$   agarose gel stained with   $\mathrm{{SYBR^{\mathrm{{TM}}}}}$    Safe DNA Gel Stain (cat. no. S33102; Thermo Fisher Scientific,  Inc.). The DNA sequencing results highlighted that they were  reproducible with no discrepancies.  

ELISA for cytokine levels.  A total of 268 samples from patients  with IS and controls based on 1:1 matching of sex, age  $\pm4$   years  and BMI   $\pm2.5$   were selected to measure IL‑6 and TNF‑  $\upalpha$  levels. Amongst these, the volume of plasma in 48 samples was  not sufficient to perform the test. The remaining 220 samples  [110 patients with IS (63 males and 47 females), age range  49‑88 years, median age 67 years and 110 controls (63 males  and 47 females), age range 47‑88 years, median age 66 years]  were subjected to ELISA.

was performed at   $^{1,200\mathrm{~x~g~}}$   for   $5~\mathrm{min}$   at room temperature.  Subsequently, plasma was aliquoted and stored at   $\mathrm{-}80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  the assessment of cytokine levels. The levels of TNF‑  $\alpha$   and  IL‑6 were determined using commercially available ELISA 

  $\mathbf{M}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{X}^{\mathrm{TM}}$   Deluxe Set Human IL‑6 (cat. no. 430504) and TNF‑  $\alpha$  (cat. no. 430204) kits, which were conducted in accordance  with the manufacturer's instructions (BioLegend, Inc.).  

Statistical analysis.  SPSS version 25 was used to analyze the  data (IBM, Corp.). The normality of data was assessed using  a Kolmogorov‑Smirnov test. The baseline characteristics of  the patients with IS and controls were examined using a  $\chi^{2}$   test  for categorical data and a Mann‑Whitney U test for continuous  data. Categorical variables are reported as proportions, whereas  continuous variables are reported as the median [interquartile  range (IQR)]. A binomial test was used to analyze the differ­ ence between the genotype and allele frequencies in patients  with IS and controls. The association of the genetic polymor­ phisms with the risk of IS was determined using multivariate  logistic regression. The Enter method, which is the default in  SPSS Statistics, was used to enter all independent variables  into the equation in one step (40). The Hardy‑Weinberg equi­ librium (HWE) was evaluated using a   $\chi^{2}$   test. To investigate  the interaction between the IS genetic polymorphism and  clinical factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis was  performed. The difference in plasma levels between patients  with IS and controls were compared using a Mann‑Whitney  U test. The difference in plasma levels of cytokines among  genotypes in patients with IS and controls was compared using  a Mann‑Whitney U tests for two groups and Kruskal‑Wallis  tests followed by a Dunn's posthoc test for three groups.   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$  was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.  

# Results  

Characteristics of patients with IS and controls.  The baseline  characteristics and clinical factors of patients with IS and  controls are presented in Table I. There were no significant  differences between the age or sex of patients between the IS  and controls   $_{\mathrm{(P>0.05)}}$  . Hypertension (patients with IS,   $77.0\%$  vs. controls,   $39.0\%$  ), hyper lipid emi a (patients with IS,   $53.0\%$  vs. controls,   $25.5\%$  , smoking (patients with IS,   $28.5\%$   vs.  controls,   $19.5\%$  ) and alcohol consumption (patients with IS,   $22.0\%$   vs. controls,   $13.0\%$  ) were significantly more frequent in  patients with IS than in the controls. IS patients had consider­ ably lower total and low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  than the controls (  $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.001)$  ). Lower cholesterol levels in patients  with IS may be linked to the use of anti‑lipidemic medications.  

Associations of IL‑6 and TNF‑ α  polymorphisms with the risk  of IS development.  The genotype distribution of  IL‑6‑ 174G/C  and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A between patients with IS and controls was  in HWE ( IL‑6 ‑174G/C, patients with IS,   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.72}$   vs. controls,   $\mathrm{{P{=}0.66}}$  ;  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A, patients with IS,   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.27}$   vs. controls,

$\mathrm{P{=}0.48\,\}$  ). It was identified that the  IL‑6 ‑174 GG genotype and  G allele were the most prevalent genotype in both patients  with IS and controls, whilst the GC genotype and C allele  were less common, and the CC genotype was not observed  in the research samples (Table II). As illustrated in the lower  panel of Fig. 2A, the representative electro p hero grams of  the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C sequencing data revealed only two distinct  genotypes (GG and GC). There was no significant difference  in the distribution of the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C genotype as well as G  and C alleles between patients with IS and controls. To deter­ mine whether the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C polymorphism was associated  with IS risk, multivariate logistic regression analysis was  performed. The results indicated that there was no association  between  IL‑6 ‑174G/C polymorphism and the risk of IS occur­ rence in dominant and recessive inheritance, after adjustment  for sex (Table III).  

For the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphism, the GG genotype  was found most frequently, followed by the GA and AA  genotypes, in the patients with IS; however, the AA genotype  was not found in the controls (Table II). The  TNF‑  $\cdot\alpha$  ‑308G/A  representative electro p hero grams of the three genotypes  (GG, GA and AA) were shown in Fig. 2B, lower panel.  No significant difference in the distribution of the geno­ types between patients with IS and controls was observed,  whilst there was a significant difference   $(\mathrm{P}{=}0.022)$  ) in the  frequency of the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 A allele between patients with  IS   $(9.3\%)$   and controls   $(4.8\%)$  . Multivariate logistic regres­ sion analysis revealed that the GA and AA genotypes, and  the A allele of  TNF‑ α ‑308 increased the risk of IS develop­ ment (GA and AA genotypes vs. GG genotype,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.951$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.071{-}3.554$  ;   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.029}$  ; and A allele vs. G allele,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.044$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI=1.154-3.620}$  ;  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.014}$  ). When the mode  of inheritance was dominant, the GA or AA genotype had a  1.97‑fold higher risk of IS development compared with the  GG genotype, after adjusting for sex (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.971$  ;   $95\%$    CI=1.080‑3.599;   $\mathrm{P{=}}0.027$  ), as shown in Table  III.  Therefore, the A allele appears to be a risk factor for IS  development in a dominant mode of inheritance. However,  when the mode of inheritance was recessive, the AA geno­ type was not an IS risk factor.  

Interaction of IL‑6 and TNF gene polymorphisms with clin­ ical variables in IS susceptibility.  To further investigate the  interaction between genes and clinical factors, an interaction  analysis of the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymor­ phisms with clinical factors was performed using multivariate  logistic regression (Tables IV and V, respectively). Carriers of  the  IL‑6 ‑174 GG genotype who had hypertension, hyperlipid­ emia or consumed alcohol exhibited an increased risk for IS  compared with those without these clinical features (hyper­ tensive subjects, adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}4.095$  ,   $95\%$   CI=2.604‑6.441,   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$  ; hyper lipid emi c subjects, adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.979$  ,  Table III.

 $^{\mathrm{a}}\mathrm{P{<}0.05.P}$  ‑values were calculated using multivariate logistic regression  analysis. The adjusted OR   $(95\%$   CI) was calculated using multivariate  logistic regression after adjustment for sex. Variables in the model  include  IL‑6 ‑174G/C and  TNF‑  ${\cdot\alpha}$  ‑308G/A. Method of variables entry  in the model: Enter method. OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.  

$95\%$   CI=1.850‑4.797,   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$  ; and alcohol consumption,  adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.968$  ,  $95\%$   CI=1.050‑3.688;  $\mathrm{P{=}0.035}$  ; Table IV).  Non‑hypertensive subjects who had the  IL‑6 ‑174 GC genotype  were less likely to develop IS compared with those who had  the GG genotype (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.087$  ,   $95\%$   CI=0.009‑0.797;   $\mathrm{P{=}0.031}$  ).  

In the present study, hypertensive and hyper lipid emi c  subjects carrying  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 GA and AA genotypes had  the highest risk of IS prevalence compared with non‑hyper­ tensive and non‑hyper lipid emi c subjects carrying the GG  genotype (hypertensive subjects, adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}4.585$  ,   $95\%$   CI=1.892‑11.110,  $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.001}$  ; and hyper lipid emi c subjects,  adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}3.016$  ,  $95\%$   CI=1.027‑8.862,  $\mathrm{P{=}0.045}$  ) (Table V).  Carriers of the GG genotype who had hypertension, hyper­ lipidemia and who consumed alcohol were susceptible to a  higher risk of IS compared with subjects with the same genetic  background but lacking these three clinical factors (hyper­ tensive subjects, adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.655$  ,   $95\%$   CI=1.721‑4.094,   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$  ; hyper lipid emi c subjects, adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.253$  ,   $95\%$   CI=1.401‑3.624,   $\mathrm{{P}{=}0.001}$  ; and alcohol drinkers, adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.934$  ,   $95\%$   CI=1.037‑3.608;   $\mathrm{P{=}0.038}$  ). Moreover, there  was no interaction between the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 GA and AA geno­ type with smoking or alcohol consumption.  

Associations of IL‑6‑174G/C and TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A poly­ morphisms with plasma IL‑6 and TNF‑ α  levels.  A total of  110 patients with IS and 110 controls were matched at 1:1, and  their cytokine levels were measured. The median (IQR) levels  of IL‑6 [patients with IS, 30.5 (14.0‑81.8)   $\mathrm{{pg}/\mathrm{{m}l}}$   vs. controls, 

  $40.5\ (17.0{-}110.3)\ \mathrm{pg/ml}]$   and TNF‑  $\alpha$   [patients with IS, 28.0 

  $(7.8{\cdot}59.5)~\mathrm{ps}/\mathrm{m}1$   vs. controls, 24.0 (14.0‑41.3)   $\mathrm{{pg/mol}}$   were not  significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, the  plasma IL‑6 and TNF‑  $\cdot\alpha$   levels were not different amongst the  various genotypes of patients with IS (Table VI). However, IL‑6  levels were significantly increased in the  IL‑6 ‑174 GC genotype  carriers compared with the GG genotype carriers amongst  controls   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.015})$  ). Thus, the  IL‑6  ‑174 GC genotype appeared  to be associated with high levels of IL‑6 in controls, but may not  be associated with the IL‑6 levels in patients with IS.  

# Discussion  

Inflammation is considered a significant contributor to IS  pathogen es is (7,8) and is proposed as a target of p harm a co log­ ical therapy for inflammatory diseases (17,18). Inflammatory  cytokines produced by immune and non‑immune cells  are up regulated upon cerebral ischemia and injury (8,41).  Furthermore, polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokine  genes at the promoter region may predict IS risk factors  and outcomes (14‑16). The present study evaluated the asso­ ciation of the genetic polymorphisms of   $I L\cdot6{-}174\mathrm{G/C}$   and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A with the risk of IS development. The current  results indicated that subjects carrying the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 GA and  AA genotypes and the A allele had a higher risk of IS devel­ opment. In line with the current findings, previous reports  have shown that the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 A allele was associated with  a risk of cerebral infarction in Korean populations (42), and  that North Indian subjects carrying  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 GA and AA  genotypes had a higher risk of coronary artery disease (43).  By contrast, the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphism was not  associated with IS risk in a Chinese population (44) but was  associated with protection against IS in East Asians (31,32).  With regards to the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C polymorphism, the present  study did not identify any association of  IL‑6 ‑174G/C with the  risk of IS, although this SNP has been revealed as a risk factor  of IS in Asians in both the dominant mode (GG vs.   $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{CC}$  ;   $\mathrm{OR}{=}0.74$  ,  $95\%$   CI=0.62‑0.88;  $\mathrm{P{=}0.0005)}$  ) and recessive mode  of inheritance (CC vs.  $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{GC}$  ;   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.61$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.17{-}2.21$  ;   $\mathrm{P{=}}0.003)$  ) (14). In addition, subjects carrying the  IL‑6 ‑174 CC  genotype were not observed in the present study population,  which was consistent with findings of previous Chinese Han  and Uyghur studies (28). The current finding demonstrated that  there was no association of the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C polymorphism  with IS risk, which was in accordance with other studies of  North Indian (16) and Chinese populations (28). Collectively,  it was suggested that the association of these two SNPs with IS  prevalence may be due to ethnic differences, methodological  differences and variations in sample sizes.  

In the present study, elevated IL‑6 levels were associ­ ated with  IL‑6 ‑174 GC genotypes in controls; however, no  association between the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphism and  TNF‑  $\alpha$   levels was found in patients with IS when compared  with the controls. The functional SNP  IL‑6 ‑174G/C in the  GC genotype is associated with higher serum IL‑6 levels,  increased IS severity and poorer outcomes in patients  with IS from North India (16). However, the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C

 $^\mathrm{a}\!\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$  ,  $^\mathrm{b}\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$  . P‑values were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The adjusted OR (  $95\%$   CI) was calculated via  multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjustment for   $\mathrm{^c{s e x}}$  , age, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, hyper lipid emi a, smoking  and drinking;  $\mathrm{^d}_{\mathrm{secX}}$  , age, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, smoking and drinking;  e sex, age, diabetes mellitus, metabolic  syndrome, hypertension, hyper lipid emi a and drinking;  f sex, age, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, hyper lipid emi a and  smoking.

polymorphism is not associated with elevated serum IL‑6  levels in young Indian patients with IS (aged 18‑45 years)  and controls (29). A meta‑analysis revealed that TNF‑  $\alpha$   levels  were significantly increased in patients with IS compared with  control subjects (15). Moreover, amongst healthy individuals,  TNF‑  $\alpha\cdot$  ‑308 GA and AA genotypes had lower TNF‑  ${\bf\nabla}\cdot{\bf O}$   levels  compared with the GG genotype (15). Inconclusive cytokine  expression results may depend on multiple non‑genetic and  genetic factors, as well as their interaction, leading to vari­ ability in the expression levels (15,29). The interactions of other  SNPs located in the inflammatory gene's promoter region (15)  or gene‑gene interactions (45) may affect the overall transcrip­ tional activity of gene promoters. However, other SNPs located  in the promoter region of the  IL‑6  and  TNF‑  $\alpha$   genes and the  interactions of each SNP are yet to be verified.  

In previous studies, it was reported that inflammatory  gene transcripts were up regulated following ischemic injury  of the astrocytes  in vitro  (46) and the brain  in vivo  (47). The  up regulation of inflammatory genes is mediated via the induc­ tion of the Toll‑like receptor/NF‑  $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$   signaling pathway, which  is the major contributor induced by cerebral ischemia/reper­ fusion (48,49). NF‑  $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$   acts as a critical transcription factor  contributing to the transcription of various inflammatory genes,  including  $I L–6$   and  TNF‑  $\alpha$    after cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion  injury (50). The DNA binding ability and transcriptional  activity of NF‑  $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$   depend on the variants at the binding site of  the NF‑  $\cdot\kappa\mathbf{B}$   target gene, which modulate gene expression and  influence disease risk (51). The molecular mechanism of how   $I L–6$   and  TNF‑  $\alpha$   gene polymorphisms influence the occur­ rence of IS remains to be elucidated. It has been suggested that  functional polymorphisms at the promoter region of the   $I L–6$  and  TNF‑  $\alpha$   genes may increase the promoters' transcriptional  activation by enhancing its responsiveness to inflammatory  stimuli‑mediated activation (52,53). Thus, modulation of gene  expression may be the mechanism via which  $I L–6$   and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  genetic variations influence IS occurrence.  

In the present analysis, the interactions between  IL‑6 ‑174 GG  and hypertension, hyper lipid emi a and alcohol consumption were  associated with a higher risk of IS. Notably, patients with IS had  a higher prevalence of hypertension, hyper lipid emi a and alcohol  consumption compared with the controls. In a Chinese popula­ tion, the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C polymorphism was found to interact with  hypertension and obesity, but not smoking, to elevate the risk  of IS development (54). The genotypes in the current analysis  differ from those in a Chinese study (54), in that the  IL‑6 ‑174  GG genotype, rather than the CC genotype, interacted with  hypertension and hyper lipid emi a. Consistent with the current  findings, it has been demonstrated that the combination of  alcohol consumption and the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C interaction increases  the risk of carotid atherosclerosis, a risk factor for stroke in

Western Germany (55). For the  TNF‑  $\cdot\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphism,  it was discovered that the GA and AA genotypes interacted  with hypertension and hyper lipid emi a to increase the risk of  developing IS. The  T  $N F{\cdot}\alpha{\cdot}308\,\mathrm{GVA+AA}$   genotypes were found  to be associated with the risk factor of hypertension in the Asian  population, which is consistent with the current findings (30).  The  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 A allele also appeared to have a higher risk of  stroke when patients also had fever (56) and showed an increased  risk of MI when combined with obesity (57). A previous study  reported that serum high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  

in  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 A allele carriers were negatively associated with  polyunsaturated fatty acid intake (58). These studies support  the current findings indicating increased risk of IS occurrence  when the  TNF‑ α ‑308 GA and AA genotypes were combined  with hypertension and hyper lipid emi a. The present study also  identified no interaction between the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308 GA and AA  genotypes and smoking for IS risk. Consistent with the current  results, the interaction of  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A with smoking was not  associated with the risk of MI (57). Thus, the current results  provide the potential clinical utility of genetic variants as one  of the risk predictions for IS development. This study can help  to inform implementation strategies and support future research  for IS prevention, lower stroke severity and improve therapeutic  options to reduce IS incidence.  

A limitation of the present study was that not all variants at  the promoter regions of  IL‑6  and  TNF‑  $\alpha$   genes were assessed.  Complete sequencing may enable the identification of poten­ tially causative mutations in the whole‑gene function region  of inflammatory genes. An interaction study of other variants  at the promoter regions of   $I L–6$   and   $T N F-{\upalpha}$   genes and the  two variants presented in the current study may be required  to determine the gene promoters' transcription ally‑related  transcripts and the association with IS susceptibility. As  the   $T N F\cdot a\cdot308\mathrm{G/A}$   polymorphism has been proposed as a  predictive risk factor of IS development in the current study,  the mechanism of how the  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphism  regulates IS susceptibility should be confirmed in the future.  Another limitation was the relatively small sample size used to  analyze plasma IL‑6 and TNF‑  $\cdot\alpha$   levels. Further investigations  with additional samples from various study populations should  be performed to confirm the current findings in the southern  Thai population and other ethnic groups.  

In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the  promoter polymorphism of  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A was associ­ ated with a higher risk of IS occurrence, while there was no  association between the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C polymorphism and the  risk of IS in this study population. It was suggested that the  IL‑6 ‑174G/C and  TNF‑  $\alpha$  ‑308G/A polymorphisms, combined  with the three clinical variables of hypertension, hyperlip­ idemia and alcohol consumption, may enhance the risk of  developing IS. Moreover, the high expression levels of IL‑6  appeared to be associated with  IL‑6 ‑174 GC genotype carriers  in the control group. Collectively, to the best of our knowledge,  the current findings provide the first report on the association  of inflammatory cytokine gene polymorphism with the risk of  IS susceptibility in a southern Thai population.
