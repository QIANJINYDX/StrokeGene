# Association of E-Selectin Gene Polymorphisms With Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Han Population  

\*   Dong-Xue Zhao, Juan Feng, Shu-Yan Cong, and Wei Zhang Department of Neurology, Sheng- Jing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China The E-selectin gene, a member of the selectin superfamily of adhesion molecules, plays an important role in the pathogen es is of thr ombo vascular diseases. The present study was designed to investigate the potential relationship between E-selectin gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke in a Chinese Han population. Three hundred fourteen ischemic stroke patients and 389 unrelated healthy controls were recruited for the study. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—rs1805193(G98T), rs5361(A561C), and rs5355(C1839T)—in the exon region of the E-selectin gene, were genotyped using a Multiplex SNaPshot sequencing assay. The data showed that the genotype and allele frequencies of G98T and C1839T SNP were similar in both ischemic stroke patients and the controls. In contrast, the frequency of both the AC genotype and the C allele of A561C was sign i cant ly higher in ischemic stroke patients than in healthy controls  $\bar{(P^{\circ}=~0.001}$  ,    $P\,<\,0.001$  , respectively). After adjusting for other risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption), the E-selectin gene AC genotype and C allele of A561C were still associated with a risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR]

  $=~2.73$  ,   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.29–5.76,    $P\ =$  0.008;   $\mathsf{O R}~=~2.80$  ,   $95\%$   CI:   $1.58–4.94$  ,    $P~<~0.001$  , respectively). Our current study demonstrates that the Eselectin SNP A561C is associated with increased risk for the development of ischemic stroke in this subset of the Han Chinese population.  $\copyright$   2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide and is the second most common cause of death (WHO, 1999) and the leading cause of long-term disability in the developed countries (American Heart Association, 2003). The associated morbidity and mortality are very high. In China, the incidence rate is about 170.3 per 100,000 (Allan and Rothwell, 2001). In general, stroke can be divided into hemorrhagic and ischemic. Ischemic stroke (IS) accounts for more than   $70\%$   of the stroke cases in China. Many factors contribute to the development of IS, such as atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, cardiac arrhythmia s, hyper coagulation, risk behaviors, and hypertension. Epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of stroke is almost ﬁvefold higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twin pairs (Brass et al., 1992). These results suggest that genetic factors are involved in the etiology of IS. Growing numbers of studies have demonstrated that IS is a multifactorial disease, and both genetic and environmental factors may contribute to its onset.  

Endo the li al dysfunction plays a crucial role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Genes related to platelet and endo the li al function in arteries have been considered as independent risk factors for stroke (Elbaz et al., 2000; Reiner et al., 2000). A leukocyte rolling along the endothelial surface is mediated by the selectin family of adhesion receptors and their carbohydrate ligands (Frenette and Wagner, 1997). Adhesion molecules are markers for endo the li al function and are involved in the development of at hero sclerotic lesions. The selectin family consists of a group of carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins), including E-, L-, and P-selectins, which mediate leukocyte recruitment to the arteriole lesion sites or areas of in amma tion. These adhesion molecules directly promote adhesive interaction between leukocytes and activated endo the li al cells and thereby initiate a cascade leading to migration of leukocytes into the subendothelial space, contributing to the pathogen es is of arte rios clerosis. The E-selectin gene, which encodes a   $110\mathrm{-}\mathrm{kDa}$  carbohydrate-binding protein, was identiﬁed and characterized in 1985 (Bevilacqua et al., 1989) and is usually expressed on activated endo the li al cells and platelets (Haring et al., 1996). The human E-selectin gene, which consists of 14 exons and 13 introns (Dong et al., 1998), is located on chromosome 1 q12. Path o physiologically, E-selectin facilitates leukocyte–endo the li al cell attachments leading to the pathogen es is of thr ombo vascular diseases (Cherian et al., 2003). Molecular analysis has revealed the presence of at least ﬁve different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in E-selectin (Wenzel et al., 1996). A U.S. study found that both A561C and C1839T SNPs are associated with increased susceptibility to IS (Haidari et al., 2009). In a sub population of Saudis, the risk of acquiring coronary heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus increases sign i cant ly in the presence of the A561C mutant allele of the E-selectin gene (Abu-Amero et al., 2007); however, this polymorphism was not an independent predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the Indian population (Tripathi et al., 2009). Hence, whether these SNPs are associated with IS remains controversial, especially in different populations.  

To date, there are no reports of an association between E-selectin gene polymorphism and IS in the Chinese population. Therefore, the present study examined the potential association of E-selectin gene SNPs, spec i call y G98T, A561C, and C1839T, with risk for the development of IS in a Chinese Han population. We also stratiﬁed subjects on the basis of sex to achieve personalized prevention of IS.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Study Subjects  

This study included 314 IS patients (181 males and 133 females) and 389 unrelated age- and sex-matched healthy controls (215 males and 174 females) who were recruited at the Sheng-Jing Hospital of China Medical University and The First Afﬁliated Hospital of China Medical University. All were Han Chinese from the same geographic area of Liaoning Province, China. Written informed consent was obtained

from all participants, and the procedures were approved by the Medical Ethics Committees of the hospital. Criteria for the enrollment of IS patients included a sudden loss of global or focal cerebral function and the diagnosis conﬁrmed by brain imaging with a computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The diagnosis of IS was conﬁrmed by a team of professional neurologists. The control group consisted of 389 people who had no clinical history of cerebro vascular diseases and were matched with IS patients in terms of residency area, ethnic origin, gender, and age. Subjects were excluded if they had a history of hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, cancer, autoimmune disease, chronic in amma tion, renal or liver in suf cie n cy, hematopathy, or peripheral angiopathy. All participants were interviewed by the investigators using a structured questionnaire. A history of conventional risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and alcohol consumption, were recorded, and the most frequently occurring risk factors are summarized in Table I.  

# Polymorphism Genotyping  

To analyze SNPs, genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Wizard genomic DNA pur i cation kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to a protocol described previously (John et al., 1991). All three E-selectin gene SNPs used for the present study were obtained from the public dbSNP database. The information on these three SNPs is shown in Table II. The SNPs include rs1805193 (G98T), rs5361 (A561C), and rs5355 (C1839T) located in the exon 2, 4, or 10 region of the E-selectin gene, respectively. Genotyping was performed using a Multiplex SNaPshot sequencing method (Bujalkova et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, genomic DNA was ﬁrst ampliﬁed with polymerase chain reactions (PCR) in a total volume of 10 liters containing   $1\times$   GC buffer I (Takara, Dalian, China),   $3.0\,\mathrm{\mum}\,\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$    (Takara),   $0.3\,\mathrm{\mum}$  dNTP (Generay Biotech, Shanghai, China), 1 unit HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), and   $1~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   each of forward and reverse primers and   $1~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   genomic DNA. Primers used for PCR include   $5^{\prime}$  -GG AT GC T GCC TT AAACATCATGGTA $.3^{\prime}$  (forward) and  $5^{\prime}$  -CCCAAAGTGAGAG CT GAGA GAA ACT G $\cdot3^{\prime}$  (reverse) for G98T,  $5^{\prime}$  - TTT T CCG TAG CT GCC T GT ACCA $.3^{\prime}$  (forward) and   $5^{\prime}$  -   T CC ACT GAA GCC A GG GT CACA $.3^{\prime}$  (reverse) for A561C,   and   $5^{\prime}$  -GC T GG ACT CT CCC TC CT GAC A $.3^{\prime}$  (forward) and  $5^{\prime}$  -TTC CT GAA A CAC TTC CCA C ACT GA $.3^{\prime}$  (reverse) for  $C1839\mathrm{T}$  .  

The thermo l cycle r was set to perform   $15\,\mathrm{\min}$   of initial de natura tion at   $95\mathrm{^\circC}$  , followed by 11 cycles of   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20 sec,   $68^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $40\ \sec$  , and   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1.5~\mathrm{min}$  ; and then 24 cycles of   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20 sec,  $63^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 sec, and   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 1.5

PCR products were then digested with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) enzyme (Promega) and exon ucl ease I enzyme (Epicenter, Madison, WI) for direct sequencing with Multiplex SNaPshot (ABI, Foster City, CA). Allele and genotype frequencies were determined through analyses of the raw data from ABI13130XL with GeneMapper 4.0 (ABI).  

# Biochemical Analysis  

Fasting plasma glucose was measured using the routine glucose oxidase method. The levels of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured using commercially available CHOD-PAP and GPO-PAPkits (Wako, Osaka, Japan), respectively. The concentrations of serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol were determined with homogeneous assays (Genzyme Diagnostics, Framingham, MA). All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) version 13.0 software. Data are summarized as mean    $\pm$   standard deviation (SD) or per  centage frequency. Pearson’s    $\chi^{2}$  test and Student’s    $t\cdot$  -test were used to compare the distribution of the demographic variables and to examine differences in risk factors and genotypes, alleles, and haplotypes between cases and controls. The Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium of the genotypes was tested by per  forming a goodness-of-ﬁt    $\chi^{2^{\circ}}$  test. Unconditional logistic regression analysis (additive model) was performed to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) with   $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for estimating the association between certain genotypes and IS patients. The ORs were also calculated by adjusting for conventional confounding variables such as diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoke, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, with 0 for negative and 1 for positive. On the basis of the observed frequencies of the three SNPs, we used the SHEsis analysis platform to calculate the  $\mathrm{D^{\prime}}$    and  $\mathrm{r}^{2}$    linkage d is equilibrium indices and inferred haplotype frequencies (Shi and He, 2005; Li et al., 2009).  

# RESULTS  

The distributions of genotype and allelic frequencies of these three SNPs in IS patients and healthy controls are shown in Table III. All allelic distributions of the studied SNPs in all participants were in agreement with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Analysis of the distribution of G98T and C1839T SNPs showed no signiﬁcant difference between IS patients and control subjects, although the frequency of IS patients with the AC genotype and the C allele of A561C was sign i cant ly higher than that of the control group (  ${\cal P}=\,0.{\bar{0}}01$   and    $P$   $\bar{<\mathrm{~0.001~}}$  , respectively; Table III). The frequency of the heterozygous genotype and the C allele was almost three times higher in the stroke patients than in the controls (11.8 vs. 4.6 and 6.2 vs. 2.3, respectively). Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms associated with IS in women are different from those in men (Yamaguchi et al., 2006). Accordingly, we analyzed the A561C SNPs between the male group and the female groups. The results are presented in Table IV. In the male group, the frequency of IS patients with the AC genotype and the C allele of A561C was sign i cant ly higher than that of the control group   $(P\,=\,\breve{0}.004$   and    $P\ {\stackrel{\sim}{=}}\ 0.002$  , respectively; Table IV). In the female group, the frequency of IS patients with the AC genotype of A561C was signiﬁ-

cantly higher than that of the control group   $(P=\mathrm{{0.046}}$  ; Table IV).  

It is known that IS is generally confounded with hypertension, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. We next analyzed all these factors in all recruited subjects and coordinated them with the frequency of SNPs. The basic and clinical characteristics of all participants are shown in Table I. Mean ages of the cases and controls (mean  6  SD) were almost identical  $(64.43~\pm~8.48$   and   $63.93~\pm~6.86$   years, respectively). Clearly, no signiﬁcant differences were found in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), or plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides between individuals with stroke and controls. However, the frequency of traditional vascular risk factors such as history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (  $P<\,0.001)$  ), tobacco smoking (  $\scriptstyle\left<P\right.\leq$  0.001), blood glucose levels   $\mathit{\Delta}^{\prime}\mathit{P}<\mathit{0.001})$  ), alcohol consumption   $(P=\overline{{0.004}})$  ), total blood cholesterol levels   $\boldsymbol{\mathit{(P=}}$  0.021), and blood levels of LDL-C   $\textstyle(P~=~0.048)$   were remarkably higher in the IS patients than in the controls. Interestingly, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the AC genotype, the C allele of A561C, was still associated with a risk of developing IS in all participants   $(\mathrm{OR}\ =\ 2.73\$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.29–5.76,    $P~=~0.{\bar{0}}08$  ;  $\mathrm{{OR}\;=\;2.80}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.58–4.94,    $P<\,0.001$  ,respectively; Table III) and in the male group   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,4.018$  ,   $95\%$   CI:

 1.556–10.376,    $P=\,0.004$  ;   $\mathrm{{OR}\,\,\bar{=}\,\,3.116}$  ,   $95\%$   CI:   $1.476-$  6.578,    $P=\,0.001\,=\,2$  , respectively; Table V) after adjusting for these traditional risk factors. However, in the female group, there was no signiﬁcant difference in distribution of AC genotype of A561C between IS patients and control subjects (Table V).  

We also analyzed haplotypes using the SHEsis platform. The two SNPs were in linkage equilibrium in this

study population. Only haplotypes with   $3\%$   or greater among both cases and controls were included in the haplotype analysis. The result of our analysis suggests that the frequency of the   $\mathrm{C}_{-561}\mathrm{C}_{-1839}$   haplotype in the patients was sign i cant ly higher than that in the controls  $\mathrm{(OR}\,=\,2.92$  ,  $\breve{9}5\%$   CI: 1.64–5.22,    $P<\,0.001$  ; Table VI).  

# DISCUSSION  

Here we performed a case–control study to examine the relationship between three E-selectin gene SNPs and IS risk. We found that there was no signiﬁcant difference in the distribution of G98T and C1839T genotypes between IS patients and control subjects, although the frequency of IS patients with the AC genotype and the C allele of A561C was sign i cant ly higher than that in the control group. The frequency of the AC heterozygous genotype and the C allele was almost three times higher in the stroke patients than in the controls. Given our rather limited sample size, further analyses were warranted to combine the AC heterozygotes with the CC homozygotes in A561C polymorphisms; the results showed that the combined A561C AC/CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of IS, with an adjusted OR of 2.73 (  $95\%$   CI: 1.29–5.76,    $P\,=\,0.008)$  ). After adjustment for other risk factors, the E-selectin gene AC genotype and the C allele of A561C, were still associated with a risk of developing IS in all subjects. The same results were observed in the male group but not in the female group. Therefore, we conclude that the A561C SNP may be one genetic risk factor of IS among male Han Chinese people. Yamaguchi et al. (2006) revealed that many gene polymorphisms associated with IS were different between women and men. Our data are in agreement with this ﬁnding. The mechanisms responsible for the difference in the polymorphisms associated with IS between women and men remain unclear. The difference might be attributable to the difference in sex hormones such as estrogen between women and men. We also performed a haplotype analysis of the SNPs of A561C and   $C1839\Bar{\Gamma}$  . The results reveal that individuals carrying the   $\mathrm{C}_{-561}\mathrm{C}_{-1839}$   haplotype have an increased risk of IS. However, this result must be veriﬁed in a larger Chinese population.  

In fact, E-selectin A561C results in a substitution of Ser128 by Arg as well as a subsequent alteration of protein folding in the mature E-selectin. Such changes in the middle of the epidermal growth factor-like domain (Wenzel et al., 1994) apparently cause (Ellsworth et al., 2001) a loss of binding speciﬁcity (Revelle et al., 1996) and affect ligand recognition and binding. Conversion of C1839T will result in an amino acid change, i.e., Leu554Phe, in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein, will alter the trafﬁcking of the gene product, and will enhance anchorage of leucocytes onto the endothelium (Wenzel et al., 1999). Unlike both A561C and C1839T SNPs, which cause a sense mutation at the protein level, the G98T SNP occurs within the   $5^{\prime}$  - un translational region. The change of G to   $\mathrm{T}$   may alter the rate of transcript turnover within cells and accordingly affect the activity of the gene product. Thus, these three SNPs may differential ly interact with other confounding factors and are associated with the pathogen es is of IS as well as other vascular abnormalities.  

Large numbers of associations between E-selectin gene polymorphisms and multiple diseases have been reported, but the results are contradictory. In agreement with the ﬁndings from a population of Iranian Caucasians, our results demonstrate that the E-selectin A561C polymorphism was sign i cant ly associated with the development of IS (Haidari et al., 2009). However, our study fails to show a signiﬁcant link of the E-selectin C1839T SNP with IS, which seems different from the observations in Caucasians (Haidari et al., 2009). The insigniﬁcant association of G98T with IS development in our study is similar to that of recent study in a population of Polish children (Sarecka-Hujar et al., 2010). Therefore, further investigations of these SNPs and their association with IS should be undertaken in different populations.  

In summary, our study on E-selectin SNPs is the ﬁrst to document an association between A561C SNPs and an increased risk for the development of IS in Chinese Han males. However, because of the relatively small sample size and the lack of serum E-selectin levels, further exploration is warranted to conﬁrm our ﬁndings in a larger Chinese population. Conceivably, after perspective studies within a large population to conﬁrm the sign i can ce, these SNPs may be used to identify predisposition toward IS among Chinese Han people.
