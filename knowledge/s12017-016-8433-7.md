Abstract  Recent genome-wide association study associated rs556621 on chromosome 6p21.1 with the risk of large artery at hero sclerotic (LAA) stroke in Caucasians. However, subsequent replicate studies showed conﬂict results in different ethnicities. This study aimed to evaluate whether rs556621 was associated with LAA stroke in Chinese Han population. In this case–control study, 659 patients with LAA stroke and 650 healthy controls were enrolled. Associations between rs556621 genotypes and LAA stroke were analyzed with logistic regression model. Rs556621 variants were associated with increased risks of LAA stroke (codominant model: OR 1.42;   $95~\%$   CI 1.01–1.99;  $P=0.010$  ; recessive model: OR 1.40;   $95~\%$   CI 1.05–1.86;  $P=0.003)$  ). When subjects were stratiﬁed by sex, TT genotype of SNP rs556621 was associated with an increased risk of LAA stroke in female when tested with recessive model (OR 2.36;  $95~\%$  CI 1.28–4.36,  $P=0.006)$  . In male subjects, however, no signiﬁcant association was detected. Smoking status, sex did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the relationship between genotypes of rs556621 and risk of LAA stroke   $(P_{\mathrm{interaction}}=0.140,$   $P_{\mathrm{interaction}}=0.076$  ). Rs556621 may play an important role in the development of LAA stroke in female Chinese of Han ethnicity. Larger studies with subjects of different ethnicities are warranted to conﬁrm these ﬁndings.

# Introduction  

As a complex disease, ischemic stroke is an outcome of long-term interactive effects of environmental and genetic factors. Twin studies, family studies, genome-wide linkage analysis, candidate gene association studies and genomewide association studies (GWAS) suggested that genetic variances were responsible for the varied risk of ischemic stroke (Brass et al.  1992 ; Kiely et al.  1993 ; Greta rs do ttir et al.  2002 ; Matarin et al.  2007 ; Gud bj arts son et al.  2009 ).  

A recent GWAS (Holliday et al.  2012 ) associated rs556621 on chromosome 6p21.1 with large artery at hero sclerotic (LAA) stroke in Caucasians. In a subsequent replicate study (Liu et al.  2014 ), this association was conﬁrmed in Xinjiang Uyghur population, but was not detected in Chinese Han Population. These varied results concerning the association between rs556621 on chromosome 6p21.1 and LAA stroke among ethnic populations may be caused by signiﬁcant gene–environment interaction, or different distribution of the relevant genotypes among ethnical groups. Further replicate studies with large sample from different ethnic populations, therefore, are needed to conﬁrm this hypothesis (Krishna mur thi et al. 2013 ).  

Smoking is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke ( Xu et al. 2013 ;Mannami et al.  2004 ; Tse et al. 2012 ). Some studies reported interactive effects of smoking and gene variances on the risk of ischemic stroke ( Liu et al. 2007 ; Oksala et al.  2008 ). Genetic determinants and smoking may increase the risk of LAA stroke synergistically in some individuals.  

This case–control study aimed to evaluate the association between rs556621 polymorphisms and risk of LAA stroke in Chinese Han population. The interactive effects of rs556621 genotypes and smoking on risk of LAA were also analyzed.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Ethics Statement  

The study followed the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was received from each enrolled participant. The protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Board of Jinling Hospital in Nanjing, China.  

# Study Population  

The study enrolled 659 patients with LAA stroke and 650 healthy controls. The patients were screened from Nanjing Stroke Registry Program (NSRP) (Liu et al.  2006 ). Details for participant recruitment were available in previous publication (Zhang et al.  2016 ). Inclusion criteria for patients: (1) Chinese Han ethnicity; (2) ﬁrst-ever stroke of LAA type diagnosed within 14 days; and (3) aged 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria were: severe heart, lung or liver diseases; renal failure; malignancies; in amma tory or systematic diseases; and he mato logic diseases.  

Age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited from local residents who received physical examination in hospitals. Inclusion criteria for controls were: Chinese Han ethnicity, aged 18 years or older, without history of cardio vascular diseases. Participants were limited to Han ethnicity from south China in order to minimize the genetic heterogeneity.  

# DNA Isolation and Genotyping  

A  $5~\mathrm{{ml}}$   venous blood sample was drawn in EDTA tubes and stored at    $-80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and was used for DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted with Tiangen DNA isolation kit (Tiangen DNA isolation kit, China) according to standard procedures. Genotyping for SNP rs556621 was conducted by the Improved Multiple Ligase Detection Reaction (iMLDR) (Thomas et al.  2004 ; Z. Zhang et al. 2015 ). According to the experimental standard procedures, the entire experimental process was supported from Center for Human Genetics Research, Shanghai Genesky Biotechnology Company. For quality control,   $5~\%$   randomly selected samples were used to assess reproducibility of genotypes, and all repeated experiments resulted in a  $100\ \%$   concordance.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Power analyses were estimated by PS software, version 3.1.2 (available at  http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/ Main/Power Sample Size ). Relevant parameters were set as follows: a type I error probability of 0.05, a ﬁxed minor allele frequency (MAF) of   $40\ \%$  , and an odds ratio   $(O R)$   of 1.4. Based on our sample size, the statistical power of this study achieved   $85.5\ \%$  . We further performed power calculations in males and females separately, and the statistical power was   $87.2\ \%$   in males,   $85.3\ \%$   in females. The Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for rs556621 genotype frequency distribution in controls was calculated by the Chisquared goodness of ﬁt test. The distributions of categorical variables between cases and controls were evaluated by Chi-square tests. And the continuous covariates were analyzed by the Student’s t test or ANOVA. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to obtain the OR and   $95~\%$   CI for the association between genotypes and LAA stroke. Smoking–genotypes interactions and sex–genotypes interactions were analyzed by SNPStats web tool (Sole et al.  2006 ). All statistical anal- yses were calculated by two-sided test. For single comparison,  $P$  value    ${<}0.05$  was deemed as statistical sign i can ce. For multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni method was adopted for correcting the    $P$   values.  $P$   value  $\mathord{<\!}0.05,$  /number of comparisons was deemed as statistical sign i can ce.  

# Results  

# Characteristics of Participants  

The clinical and demographic characteristics of participants are shown in Table  1 . A total of 659 patients with LAA stroke, 490   $(74.4~\%)$   males and 169   $(25.6\ \%)$  females, were enrolled in the case group. A total of 650 healthy volunteers, 463   ${\it71.2~\%})$   males and 187   $(28.2\ \%)$  females, were enrolled as controls. As shown in Table  1 , patients with LAA stroke had a higher prevalence of hypertension (68.3 vs.   $30.5~\%$  ,  $P<0.001$  ), prevalence of

DM (27.6 vs.  $8.6\ \%$  ,  $P<0.001\$  ) and proportion of smoking (47.0 vs.   $40.2~\%$  ,    $P=0.012)$  ) than controls. These variables (hypertension, DM, and smoking) as well as age, sex and hyper lipid emi a were adjusted in the multivariate logistic regression analysis for evaluating the main effects of rs556621 genotypes on risk of LAA stroke.  

# Associations of the rs556621 Variants with LAA Stroke  

The genotype distributions of SNP rs556621 in the controls did not deviate from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium  $P=0.388$  ). As shown in Table  2 , the frequencies of the GG, GT, and TT genotypes were 25.6, 46.7, and  $27.7\ \%$   in LAA patients, and 28.2, 51.4, and   $20.4~\%$   in healthy controls, respectively. We assessed the association of SNP rs556621 variant with LAA stroke in different genetic models, including codominant, dominant, recessive, and allelic models. After adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, DM, hyper lipid emi a and smoking, TT genotype of rs556621 was associated with an increased risk of LAA stroke (OR 1.40;   $95~\%$   CI 1.05–1.86;    $P=0.003)$  ) in the recessive model.  

# Sex-Stratiﬁed Analysis  

When subjects were stratiﬁed by sex, TT genotype of SNP rs556621 was associated with an increased risk of LAA stroke in female when tested with recessive model  ( OR 2.36;   $95~\%$   CI 1.28–4.36,    $P=0.006\$  ) (Table  3 ). But in male subjects, no signiﬁcant association between genotypes of SNP rs556621 and the risk of LAA stroke was detected (Table  4 ).  

# Rs556621 Genotypes and Sex Interaction Analysis  

As shown in Table  5 , compared with male with GG/GT genotype, female with GG/GT genotypes had similar risk of LAA stroke (OR 1.01;   $95~\%$   CI, 0.71–1.43). TT genotype was associated with increased risk of LAA stroke in female (OR 2.21;   $95~\%$   CI, 1.27–3.85). However, this association was not detected in male (OR 1.22;   $95~\%$   CI, 0.88–1.69). Overall, sex did not sign i cant ly inﬂuence the association between genotypes of rs556621 and the risk of LAA stroke   $(P_{\mathrm{interaction}}=0.076)$  .  

# Smoking Status and rs556621 Genotypes Interaction Analysis  

The interaction of rs556621 genotypes and smoking on the risk of LAA stroke is shown in Table  6 .  

Compared with non-smoking subjects with GG/GT genotype, those with TT genotype had a 1.69 times (  $95~\%$  CI 1.16–2.48) of risk of LAA stroke. On the other hand, for subjects with GG/GT genotype, smokers had a 1.91-fold risk of LAA stroke than non-smokers   $(95\;\%\;\mathrm{CI}\;1.40{-}2.62)$  ). Moreover, smoking subjects with TT genotype had a 2.11- fold risk (  $95~\%$   CI 1.35–3.28) of LAA stroke than nonsmoking subjects with GG/GT genotype. Overall, smoking status did not sign i cant ly inﬂuence the relationship between genotypes of rs556621 and risk of LAA stroke  $(P_{\mathrm{interaction}}=0.140)$  .  

# Discussion  

In this replicate study, TT genotype of rs556621 was associated with an increased risk of LAA stroke in Chinese Han population. TT genotype carriers had a 1.40-fold risk for LAA stroke compared with GG/GT genotype carriers. Rs556621 variants were associated with LAA stroke in female, but not in male. These results suggested that the rs556621 variants might play an important role in the development of LAA stroke in Chinese Han population, especially in female.  

In a recent GWAS study, variant rs556621 was associated with an increased risk of LAA stroke in Caucasians (Holliday et al.  2012 ). A subsequent replicate study performed by Liu and colleagues revealed that rs556621 variants were associated with LAA stroke patients in the Chinese Uyghur cohort   $P=0.045$   for genotypic distribution,  $P=0.042$  for allelic distribution; the allele

frequencies,    $T=0.634$  ,  $G=0.366)$  ), but not in the Chinese Han cohort  $(P=0.955$  for genotypic distribution,  $P=0.936$   for allelic distribution; the allele frequencies,  $T=0.554$  ,    $G=0.446$  , Liu et al.  2014 ). Nonetheless, our results showed that rs556621 variants increased LAA stroke risk in the southern Chinese Han female population (the allele frequencies,  $T=0.514$  ,  $G=0.496)$  ). The inconsistency may be due to genetic heterogeneity in different ethnic origins and regions. Moreover, our previous study found that Xinjiang was included in the stroke belt of China, where the incidence of stroke was higher than the other regions ( Xu et al. 2013 ). As can be found from 1000 Genomes website ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/ tools/1000 genomes/ ), the allele frequencies of rs556621 are different between Chinese and European populations (CHS:  $T=0.457$  ,  $G=0.543$  and CEU:  $T=0.273$  ,  $G=0.727$  ), suggesting that differences in allele frequencies of rs556621 between Chinese and European populations may account in part for these discrepant results.  

Rs556621 is located on chromosome 6p21.1 and lies within a small length of genomic sequence, which contains a large number of enhancer- and/or promoter-related marks

of histone protein modi cation and contains BCL3 and PBX3 transcription factor (Holliday et al.  2012 ). The two most common histone modi cations are histone acetyl ation and histone methyl ation (Duarte  2013 ). Histone modiﬁcations may activate or repress transcription (Jenuwein and Allis  2001 ). Previous study found that histone modi cation was associated with the pathology of ischemic brain injury (Miao et al.  2015 ). Rs556621 variants may be associated with LAA stroke via regulating gene expression by histone modi cation pathway. BCL3 is an I j B protein which can regulate   $\mathrm{NF}{\cdot}\kappa\mathbf{B}$   target genes expression (Herrington and Nibbs  2016 ; Ruan et al.  2010 ; Zhang et al.  1994 ). NF-  $\mathbf{\cdot}\kappa\mathbf{B}$   is a critical nuclear transcription factor and exists in almost all cells (Zhang et al.  2013 ). Studies have showed that NF $\kappa\mathbf{B}$   activation plays important roles in the development of cerebral ischemia and ischemic stroke (Wang et al.  2010 ; Liu et al.  2009 ; Stephenson et al.  2000 ). Marchetti et al. ( 2015 ) found that BCL3 can inﬂuence the development of atherosclerosis. The PBX3 gene may be a neuro protective candidate gene for stroke (Tang et al.  2006 ). Additionally, a lot of predicted microRNAs (miRNAs) locate in the neighbor regions of rs556621. miRNAs are endogenous small noncoding short single-stranded RNAs, which regulate gene expression via repressing translation or degrading messenger RNA transcripts (Liu et al.  2015 ). Recent reports have implicated that microRNAs are important in the pathological process of ischemic stroke (Saugstad 2010 ; Rink and Khanna  2011 ; Tan et al.  2011 ; Ouyang et al.  2013 ). The variant rs556621 may also affect gene expression via altering regulatory microRNA sequences and then affect the risk of LAA stroke. The above explanations provide potential links between the variant rs556621 and the LAA stroke. The underlying biological and molecular mechanisms need further clar i cations.  

In light of previous ﬁndings, we further investigated the potential interactions between the rs556621 and smoking. The effect of rs556621 on the risk of LAA stroke differed according to the smoking status. In particular, smokers with rs556621 TT genotype had a signiﬁcant 2.11-fold increase in incidence of LAA stroke compared to nonsmokers with GG/GT genotype. However, our study revealed that the interaction between the rs556621 and smoking status on LAA stroke was not statistically signiﬁcant. Nevertheless, our results demonstrated a clear difference in the magnitude of LAA risk across rs556621 genotypes according to the smoking status, suggesting a possible gene–environment interaction that inﬂuences LAA stroke risk. Furthermore, we investigated the potential interactions between the rs556621 and sex, and we found that the interaction between the rs556621 and sex on LAA stroke was not statistically signiﬁcant.  

Our study has several limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the results. First, there might be potential selection bias due to the hospital-based study design. Second, other risk factors, such as coronary heart disease, obesity, carotid arterial stenosis and hyperhomocy steinem i a, were not analyzed in this study, which may introduce extra biases. Another limitation was relatively small sample size in this study. However, our power calculation indicated that we have   $85.5\ \%$   power at a 0.05 sign i can ce level to detect a minimal OR of 1.4 with an exposure frequency of   $40\ \%$   under the current sample size. In addition, we demonstrated that the rs556621 variants may be associated with the risk of LAA stroke in the southern Chinese Han female population, but more SNPs in broader region with larger sample sizes should be investigated in future study.  

In conclusion, rs556621 variants might play an important role in the development of LAA stroke in the Chinese Han female population. Larger studies in different ethnicities are warranted to verify these ﬁndings. Furthermore, functional studies will be required to explore the underlying biological and molecular mechanisms.
