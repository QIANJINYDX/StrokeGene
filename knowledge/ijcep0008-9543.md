Abstract:  Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants associated with coro­ nary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke (IS) and serum lipid traits in different ethnic groups. Some loci were  found to affect the risk of CAD and IS. However, there were no data in the southern Chinese populations. Our study  was to assess the association of  CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1  rs599839, rs464218 and rs6698443 SNPs and serum  lipid levels and the risk of CAD and IS. The genotypes of 3 SNPs were detected in 561 CAD and 527 IS patients, and  in 590 healthy controls. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs599839 SNP were different between the con­ trols and IS patients   $\textstyle P<0.05)$  . The minor G alleles of rs599839 and rs464218 SNPs were associated with higher  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in CAD and IS patients (  $\left(P<0.05\right)$  ); respectively. No association  was found between the SNPs of rs599839, rs464218 and rs6698843 at the  CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1  and the risk  of CAD or IS .  These results will be replicated in the other Chinese populations.

# Introduction  

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) includes coro­ nary artery disease (CAD), cerebro vascular dis­ ease, hypertension, and other CVDs, while  leading cause of death in the world, about 13.9  million (representing   $22.9\%$   of all deaths) died  from them. In addition, the CVDs remain among  the top six causes of burden of disease (DALYS)  in 2004 [1]. Ischemic stroke (IS) has some com­ mon risk factors with CAD, such as hyperten­ sion, dys lipid emi a, and genetic variants [2].  Concentrations of low- and high-density lipo­ protein cholesterol (LDL-C and HDL-C) and tri­ glyceride (TG) are each positively (or, in the  case of HDL-C, negatively) associated with the  risk of CAD [3, 4].   It is confirmed that genetic  and environmental factors modulated serum  lipid l evels [5]. Understanding the genes  involved blood lipoprotein  or lipid traits and 
 the association between common variants and  

# CAD or IS may inform therapy or preventive  methods.  

Over the last 10 years, genome-wide associa­ tion studies (GWAS) have identified  CELSR2- PSRC1-SORT1  variants on chromosome 1p13.3  associated with CAD and plasma lipoprotein s  based on populations of European [6, 7], east­ ern Asia [8, 9], southern Asia [10], MiddleEastern Asia [11], and Africa Americans [12].  These SNPs encodes cadherin EGF LAG sevenpass G-type receptor 2, proline/serine-rich  coiled-coil 1, and sortilin; respectively. Sortilin,  encoded by  SORT1 , is a receptor for apolipopro­ tein (Apo) B100. It facilitates the formation and  hepatic export of ApoB100-containing lipopro­ teins, regulating plasma LDL-C [13]. However,  little is known about such association in the  southern Chinese people, especially the asso­ ciation of  CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1  variants and  IS. Therefore, the present study was to assess

# Materials and methods  

# Study subjects  

A total of 561 patients with CAD and 527  patients with IS were recruited from hospital­ ized patients in the First Affiliated Hospital,  Guangxi Medical University. All of the enrolled  CAD patients were evaluated by coronary angi­ ography due to suspected CAD or unrelated  conditions requiring ang io graphic evaluation;  the coronary angiograms were analyzed by two  experienced interventional cardiologists. CAD  was defined as significant coronary stenosis   $\backsimeq$     $50\%$   in at least one of the three main coronary  arteries or their major branches (branch diam­ eter   $\geq2\ \mathsf{m m}$  ). Subjects with congenital heart  disease and type I diabetes mellitus were  excluded. All of the enrolled IS patients receiv-ed a strict neurological examination and brain  magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis of  IS was according to the International Clas-sification of Diseases (9th Revision). Patients  with a transient ischemic attack, embolic brain  infarction, stroke caused by inflammatory dis­ ease, cardio-embolic stroke, autoimmune dis­ ease, or serious chronic diseases were exclud­ ed from this study. Subjects with a past history  of CAD were also excluded from the study [14].  

A total of 590 healthy controls matched by age,  gender, and geographical area were included.  The controls were judged to be free of CAD and  IS by questionnaires, medical history, and clini­ cal examination. All individuals enrolled were  from the Han population in Guangxi, China. A  standard questionnaire was used to ascertain  general information and medical history from  all participants. The study protocol was ap-proved by the Ethics Committee of the First  Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University.  Informed consent was obtained from all sub­ jects after receiving a full explanation of the  study.  

# Genotyping and biochemical analysis  

All of the biochemical assays and genotyping in  CAD and IS patients were performed after hos­ pit aliz ation, and all of the venous blood sam­ ples were obtained from the patients and con­ trols after at least   $^{12\ \mathsf{h}}$   of fasting. Genomic  DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leu-kocytes using the phenol-chloroform method.  We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) from NCBI dbSNP Build 132 ( http:// www.Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/). Genotyping of th-
 e three SNPs was performed by the Snapshot  technology platform. All experimental manipu­ lations were completed in the Center for Hum-an Genetics Research, Shanghai Genesky BioTech Co. Ltd. The primers were as follows:  rs599839F: 5’-CCC AG AT CGC GCC ATTA AAC-3’;  

type distribution and sex ratio  between the groups. The general  characteristics between the ca-ses and controls were tested  using Student’s unpair ed  t -test.   The association betwe en geno­ types and serum lipid parameters  was tested by analysis of covari­ ance (ANCOVA). Sex, age, body  mass index (BMI), blood pressure,  alcohol consumption, and ciga­ rette smoking were adjusted for 
 in the statistical analysis. ORs  and   $95\%$   CIs were calculated us-ing conditional logistic regression.  A two-tailed   $P$    value less  than  0.05 was considered to be statis­ tically significant. The pattern of  pair-wise linkage d is equilibrium  (LD) between the selected SNPs  was measured by   $\mathsf{D}^{\prime}$   and   $r^{2}$   using  the SHEsis software.

The levels of  total cholesterol (TC),  TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C in the samples were  determined by enzymatic methods with com­ mercially available kits. Serum Apo AI and ApoB  levels were detected by an immuno turbid im-etric immuno as say using a commercial kit  (RANDOX Laboratories Ltd.) [15]. The normal  values for serum TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoAI,  ApoB and ApoAI to ApoB ratio at our Clinical  Science Experiment Center (Nanning, China)  were 3.10-5.17, 0.56-1.70, 0.91-1.81, 2.70-

 3.20 mmol/L, 1.00-1.78, 0.63-1.14 g/L, and 

 1.00-2.50; respectively.  

Table 1  compares the general characteristics  and serum lipid levels between the healthy con­ trols and CAD or IS patients. The mean age,  gender distribution, serum LDL-C and ApoB lev­ els were not different between controls and  CAD or IS patients   $(P>0.05$   for all). The CAD  patients had higher BMI, pulse pressure and  serum TG levels, but lower diastolic blood pres­ sure, serum TC, HDL-C, ApoAI levels, ApoAI/ ApoB ratio, and the percentages of subjects  who consumed alcohol or smoked cigarettes  than the controls   $(P~<~0.05{\cdot}0.001)$  ). The IS  patients had higher BMI, systolic blood pres­ sure, pulse pressure, serum TG levels, and the  percentage of subjects who smoked cigarettes;  and lower serum TC, HDL-C, ApoAI levels, Apo-AI/ApoB ratio, and the percentage of subjects  who consumed alcohol than the controls   $(P<$    0.05-0.001).

rs599839, rs464218 and rs6698843 SNPs  were no differences between the controls and  CAD patients   $(P>0.05)$  ). However, the genotype  and allele frequencies of the rs599839 SNP  were different between the controls and IS  patients   $(P<0.05)$  ).  

# Genotypes and serum lipid levels  

As shown in  Table 3 , the minor G alleles of  rs599839 and rs464218 were associated wi-th high HDL-C concentrations in CAD and IS  patients   $(P<0.05)$  ); respectively. We found that  the rs599839, rs464218 and rs6698843  SNPs were not associated with lipoprotein or  lipid-related traits in the total population   $(P>$    0.05); respectively ( Table 4 ). A weak linkage  d is equilibrium was found among the rs599839,  rs464218 and rs6698843 SNPs   $(r^{2}<0.1)$  ).

# Discussion  

In this case-control genetic study, we first  reported that the G allele of rs599839 and  rs464218 was associated with high HDL-C con­ cent rations in CAD and IS patients. These find­ ings are inconsistent with previous research  results which were associated with LDL-C con­ cent rations in the GWAS [16] or in the recent  pooled analysis.   The minor G allele of rs599839  was associated with low LDL-C levels in Au-strians [17], Indians [18], Japanese population  [19], central Chinese population [20] and Pa-kistanis [21], and with high TC in Netherland  population [22] Angela ko poul ou  et al.  [23] found that rs599839 SNP was associated with  TC, LDL-C and ApoB in seven prospective stud­ ies. Kathiresan  et al . [24] showed that the SNPs  of rs599839 and rs646776 were associated  with LDL-C in 18,554 independent participants.  In addition, rs12740374 SNP was strongly  associated with LDL-C in African Americans  [12]. We conjectured that the reason for these  differences may include: (i) the minor allele fre­ quency of rs599839 SNP in the controls   $(3\%)$    was much lower than that in the International  HapMap Utah residents with ancestry from  northern and western Europe   $\it{32\%}$  ;  http://hap­ map.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-perl/gbrowse/hap­ map24_B36/ ); (ii) possible gene-gene interac­ tion;  SORT1  encodes sortilin, which is one of  five members of the   $\mathsf{V p s10p}$   domain receptor  family, a group of multi functional proteins typi­ cally found in intracellular compartments of the  trans -Golgi  net  work (TGN) and early endo­ somes [25]. At the 1q42 locus near  GALNT2  for  HDL-C, encodes polypeptide N-acetyl galactos­

aminyl transfer as e 2, an enzyme involved in  O-linked g lycos yl ation and transfer of N-ace-tyl galactosamine to the serine or threonine res­ idues on proteins. O-linked g lycos yl ation has a  regulatory role for many proteins [26]. Like this  adjacent genes interactions and linkage dis­ equilibrium on lipid metabolism also need a lot  of molecular and cell biology experiments in  the future. (iii) Diet and physical activity are  strongly associated with serum lipid levels [27,  28]. (iv) The influence of drug treatment; CAD  and IS patients take anti-at hero sclerotic medi­ cines, such as statins, fibrates. It is a potential  confounder when evaluating the impact of  some genes on lipids.  

A large number of studies have found that  CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1  polymorphism is asso­ ciated with the risk of CAD [16, 20, 23, 24,  29-31], whereas the SNP of rs646776 showed  no significant associations with CAD in Leba-nese cohort [11]. In the MORGAM Prospective  Cohorts from Finland, Sweden, France and  Northern Ireland [32], the SNPs of rs599839  and rs4970834 were not strongly associated  with incident CAD and stroke. No significant  associations were observed between the rs-599839 and rs646776 SNPs and CAD mortal­ ity a Norwegian case-cohort study [33]. In the  current study, we found that the SNPs of  rs599839, rs464218 and rs6698843 at  CE-LSR2-PSRC1-SORT1  were uncorrelated with  the risk of CAD. This inconsistent results indi­ cate that the possible effected mechanisms of  these SNPs on CAD are yet unknown. Gender,  race, age or sample size and possible geneenvironment interactions on CAD risks may  cause the reduction of significant associations.  Moreover, after disease started, phenotype for  diagnosis may turn up, but in a specific point in  time, individuals with certain genes may show a  series of alternative phenotypes, affected by  possible environmental exposure. More re-search is needed.  

Although the genotype and allele frequencies  of the rs599839 SNP were higher in IS patients  than in the controls, our findings showed th-at the SNPs of rs599839, rs464218 and  rs6698843 were not associated with the risk  of IS.  CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1  was also not the  candidate gene for IS in previous GWAS [34].  

There are two limitations in the present study.  First, the number of subjects for minor allele of  SNPs was too small to interpret the associa­ tions of SNPs and the risk of diseases. Second,  the interactions of gene-gene and gene-envi­ ronment on serum lipid levels remain to be  determined. Therefore, larger sample size and  multi-ethnic population studies are needed to  confirm our results.  

In conclusion, the present study shows that the  minor G allele of rs599839 and rs464218  SNPs is associated with high HDL-C concentra­ tions in CAD and IS patients, no associations  were found between the SNPs of rs599839,  rs464218 and rs6698843 at  CELSR2-PSRC1- SORT1  and the risk of CAD or IS .
