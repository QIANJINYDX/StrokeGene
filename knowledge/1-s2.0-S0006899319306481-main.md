The interleukin 6 receptor ( IL6R ) gene has been shown to locate in the chromosome 1q21 associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), a condition related to the augmented risk of ischaemic stroke (IS), cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between  IL6R  gene polymorphisms and IS in patients with MetS in the Chinese Han population. We designed a case-control study enrolling 447 patients with MetS plus IS and 438 patients with MetS alone. Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the  IL6R  gene were determined by a fine-mapping strategy and genotyped using SNPscan technology. A logistic regression model was used to analzse the associations between the genetic variations in  IL6R  and the risk of IS in MetS patients. The linkage d is equilibrium (LD) analysis was performed and four gamete rules were used to define the block. The haplotypes was reconstructed by the SNPstats software. Two SNPs were significantly related to the risk of IS in MetS patients after adjusting for potential con founders as follows: regarding rs12083537, the GG genotype and the GA genotype decreased the risk of IS in the MetS patients compared with the IS risk in the patients with the AA genotype (multivariate-adjusted,  $P\,=\,0.005)$  ); and regarding rs8192284, the CC genotype and the AC genotype decreased the risk of IS compared with the IS risk in the patients with the AA genotype (multivariate-adjusted,  $P\,=\,0.004)$  . Strong LD was existed in block 2 and the haplotype analysis showed that compared with the ACCG haplotype, the ATCT haplotype (adjusted OR 1.700;  $95\%$   CI 1.246–2.319;  $P\,=\,0.001]$  ) increased the risk of IS in the MetS patients. The analysis of the SNP-SNP interactions showed that rs8192284 was the most influential contributor to the risk of IS in the MetS patients. Our results indicate that rs12083537 and rs8192284 in the  IL6R  gene might be related to the risk of IS in MetS patients.  

Keywords: Interleukin 6 receptor Gene polymorphism Ischaemic stroke Metabolic syndrome  

in obesity rates, ageing populations, and sedentary lifestyles, MetS incidence and prevalence have increased worldwide ( Cornier et al., 2008 ). It has been shown that MetS is related to a 2-fold increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease and a 1.5-fold increased risk of allcause mortality ( Mottillo et al., 2010 ).  

# 1. Introduction  

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) refers to a cluster of risk factors related to vascular and metabolic abnormalities including hypertension, visceral obesity, dys lipid a emi a and hyperglycemia. Because of the increase  

As a leading cause of long-term disability and death worldwide, ischaemic stroke (IS) is a multi-factorial disorder. Substantial evidence from previous studies indicates that the IS risk has genetic influences and that the risks vary among ethnic populations ( Dichgans, 2007; Matarín et al., 2007; Jerrard-Dunne et al., 2003 ). Former studies have showed that the  IL6R  gene is located on human chromosome 1q21, which is a region related to type 2 diabetes and MetS ( Jiang et al., 2010; Hamid et al., 2004 ). Because hypertension, hyper lipid a emi a and hyper gly c emi a are potential a etiologies that can predispose patients to stroke ( Sacco, 2001; Elkind and Sacco, 1998 ), we hypothesize that  IL6R gene polymorphisms are related to IS in MetS patients. Thus, we investigated this hypothesis in the current case-control study involving a Chinese Han population. The results may serve to identify MetS patients who are at a higher risk of IS and may serve these patients by guiding the development of intensive prevention strategies.  

# 2. Results  

# 2.1. Baseline characteristics of the study subjects  

In total 447 eligible cases and 438 eligible controls with valid data were recruited for the present study. Genotyping was successfully performed in all participants. The baseline characteristics of the present study subjects are summarized in  Table 1 . The case group and control group were matched by sex   $(P\,=\,0.351)$  ) and age   $(P\,=\,0.308)$  ). Compared with the controls, the cases had a higher prevalence of hyper gly c emi a   $(P~=~0.019)$  , hypertension   $(P~=~0.040)$  , dys lipid a emi a  $(P=0.010)$   and smoking   $(P=0.016)$  ). Additionally, the fasting glucose level in the cases was much higher than that in the controls  $(P\,=\,0.003)$  ).  

# 2.2. IL6R genetic variation and the risk of IS in the MetS patients  

The genotype distributions of the  IL6R  gene complied with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the controls ( Table 2 ).  Table 3 shows the relationship between the  $I L6R$   polymorphisms and the risk of IS in the MetS patients. Of the ten selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), two SNPs (rs12083537 and rs8192284) in the  IL6R gene were found to be related to the risk of IS in the MetS patients. Regarding rs12083537, in the multivariable logistic regression model, the AG genotype (AG vs AA, OR 0.634;   $95\%$   CI 0.443–0.908;

  $\textit{P}=\ 0.013\$  ) and the GG genotype (GG vs AA, OR 0.171;   $95\%$   CI

  $0.036{-}0.804$  ;  $P\,=\,0.025.$  ) decreased the risk of IS in the MetS patients compared with the IS risk in the patients with the AA genotype. The adjusted ORs (  $.95\%$   CI) of rs12083537 in the dominant model and the recessive model were 0.588 (0.414–0.834) and 0.186 (0.039–0.873),

respectively. Regarding rs8192284, after adjusting for potential confounders, the AC genotype (AC vs AA, OR 0.692;   $95\%$   CI 0.517–0.926;

  $\textit{P}=\ 0.013)$   and the CC genotype (CC vs AA, OR 0.514;   $95\%$   CI

  $0.332{-}0.796$  ;  $P\,=\,0.003.$  ) decreased the risk of IS in the MetS patients compared with the IS risk in the patients with the AA genotype. The adjusted ORs   $\textlangle95\%$   CI) of rs8192284 in the dominant model and recessive model were 0.651 (0.493–0.859) and 0.633 (0.422–0.948), respectively. In the additive model and dominant model, rs12083537 and rs8192284 were still significantly associated with the risk of IS in the MetS patients after Bonferroni correction   $\left(P\ \ <\ \ 0.05/3\right)$  . The sample power for rs12083537 and rs8192284 were 0.934 and 0.889 separately.  

# 2.3. LD analysis and haplotype analysis  

The results of linkage d is equilibrium (LD) were showed in the heatmap. The color in the box is from white to red, which means the chain degree is from low to high. The value in the box is  $r^{2}$    times 100.  $r^{2}$  is a measure of LD which is the correlation coefficient between pairs of loci. A value of 0 for    $r^{2}$    indicates that the examined loci are in fact independent of one another, while a value of 1 demonstrates complete dependency. In the LD analysis, as shown in  Fig. 1 , two blocks were found in the ten selected SNPs. High allelic associations were detected in these two blocks. In block 1, the    $r^{2}$    values between rs12083537 and rs7411976, rs12083537 and rs4075015, and rs7411976 and rs4075015 were 0.97, 0.77 and 1.00, respectively. In block 2, the  $r^{2}$    values between rs4845625 and rs4845374, rs4845625 and rs8192284, rs4845625 and rs7514452, rs4845374 and rs8192284, rs4845374 and rs7514452, and

rs8192284 and rs7514452 were 0.98, 0.94, 0.94, 0.93, 0.91 and 0.82, respectively. In block 2, after adjusting for sex, age, obesity, hyper gly c emi a, hypertension, dys lipid a emi a, drinking and smoking, the ATCT haplotype (OR 1.700;   $95\%$   CI 1.246–2.319) significantly increased the risk of IS in the MetS patients compared to the risk in the patients with the ACCG haplotype ( Table 4 ).  

# 2.4. SNP-SNP interactions  

The SNP-SNP interactions among the ten selected tag SNPs in the IL6R  gene were analyzed by generalized multi factor dimensionality reduction (GMDR). The interactions among the ten tag SNPs associated with the risk of IS in the MetS patients are presented in  Table 5 . In the single-locus model, after adjusting for sex, age, obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, dys lipid a emi a, drinking and smoking, rs8192284 was the most influential contributor to the risk of IS in the MetS patients, with a cross-validation consistency (CVC) of 9/10 and a testing accuracy (TA) of 0.5374, which is consistent with the results of the previous logistic analysis.  

# 3. Discussion  

The results of the current study showed that rs12083537 and rs8192284 in the  IL6R  gene are related to the risk of IS in MetS patients. Furthermore, the haplotype analysis indicated that compared with the ACCG haplotype, the ATCT haplotype increased the risk of IS in the

MetS patients in block 2, and the SNP-SNP interaction analysis showed that rs8192284 was the most influential contributor to the risk of IS in the MetS patients. The results of this study may serve to identify MetS patients at a higher risk of IS who could likely benefit from primary prevention therapies in the Chinese Han population.  

MetS is a pathological state in which mutually connected metabolic abnormalities and various vascular risk factors occur concomitantly and is a growing public health problem worldwide. Studies have reported that metabolic disorders could damage vasomotor function, reduce fibrinolytic activity ( Kodaman et al., 2016 ), produce a hyper coa gul able state, and promote the initiation, promotion and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques ( Rask-Madsen and Kahn, 2012 ). As a pro inflammatory state, MetS is likely to contribute to accelerated at hero genesis and has been reported to augment the risk of stroke, the cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality ( Mottillo et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2007; Eberly et al., 2006 ).  

Inflammation is implicated in at hero genesis ( Ross, 1999 ). Interleukin 6 (IL6) is an important pleiotropic cytokine produced by multiple cell types and a key inflammation-modulating cytokine that could contribute to the pathogen es is of a the roth rom bot ic disease ( Kristian sen and Mandrup-Poulsen, 2005; Yudkin et al., 2000 ). The relationship between IL6 and metabolic diseases has been reported in the past. For example, a population-based cross-sectional study from Brazil reported that plasma levels of IL6 was much higher in individuals with MetS than the levels in individuals without MetS ( Main ting u er et al., 2018 ). A prospective study showed elevated plasma concentration of IL6 was related to increased risk of future myocardial infarction in apparently healthy men ( Ridker et al., 2000 ). Studies also showed that serum IL6 levels were associated with diabetes, insulin resistance and obesity ( Degirmenci et al., 2019; Pîrsean et al., 2019 ).  

IL6 must bind IL6R to trigger the intracellular signalling cascades that lead to the inflammatory response. Studies have reported the role of the  IL6R  gene in modulating IL6 levels ( Jiang et al., 2010; Reich et al., 2007 ), and several polymorphisms in the  IL6R  gene have been found to be related to obesity, hyperglycemia, MetS and coronary heart disease ( Jiang et al., 2010; Sarwar et al., 2012; Swerdlow et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2005; Wolford et al., 2003 ). These data suggest that IL6R may regulate inflammation and atherosclerosis.  

The rs8192284 (merged into rs2228145 since 2008), is located in exon 9 of the  IL6R  gene and confers a nucleic acid change   $(\mathtt{A}\ >\ \mathtt{C},$  Asp358Ala) that is thought to lead to impairment in IL6R-mediated signalling. Studies have suggested that by decreasing the membranebound IL6R levels, the 358Ala allele (the minor C allele at rs8192284) of Asp358Ala might impair classic IL6R signalling and thereby be related to decreased C-reactive protein expression and a decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease ( Sarwar et al., 2012; Swerdlow et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012 ). The rs12083537 polymorphism varies by the alternative presence of an adenine or a guanine. This polymorphism is located on chromosome 1 in intron 1 of  IL6R , which is  $2.9\,\mathrm{\kb}$   away from exon 1. Studies have found that the rs12083537 polymorphism is related to altered levels of circulating C-reactive protein and body mass index (BMI) and nominally related to an increased risk of all-cause death and cardiovascular death in patients with severe heart failure ( Hansen et al., 2019; Edwards et al., 2012; Qi et al., 2009 ). We speculate that the SNPs rs8192284 and rs12083537 might influence the inflammatory process, resulting in the attenuation of the downstream effects of IL6 (such as reduced concentrations of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein), and the final consequence could be a reduced risk of IS in MetS patients. Further studies are necessary to explore the molecular mechanism by which the  IL6R  gene influences IS risk.  

The potential limitations of our study should be discussed. First, regarding the control group, we did not exclude participants with a family history of stroke or cardiovascular disease who might have higher frequencies of genotypes related to stroke or cardiovascular disease, which might have increased the likeliness of a type II error. Second, in the current study, we assessed BMI instead of waist circumference, which might be slightly inaccurate for a MetS diagnosis. However, a previous study showed that in Chinese adults, BMI and waist circumference can both be used for the prediction of central obesity ( Ovbiagele et al., 2006 ). Therefore, it is improbable that the results were alterred by using BMI as a proxy. Third, the serum IL6 concentration was not tested. We did not analyze the relationship between IL6 and the risk of IS in MetS patients. Furthermore, the data were observational, and the reported relationships cannot be proven as causal.  

# 4. Conclusion  

In conclusion, rs8192284 and rs12083537 in the  IL6R  gene might be related to IS in MetS patients. Further studies are necessary to replicate this association in other ethnic groups and explore the molecular mechanism by which the  IL6R  gene influences IS risk. These results prompt the speculation that targeting the  IL6R  could be a potentially novel preventative strategy for IS.  

# 5. Materials and methods  

# 5.1. Ethics statement  

This study was approved and performed under the ethical guidelines issued by the institutional ethics committees of the participating hospitals in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The participants or their next of kin provided written informed consent.  

5.2. Study population  

Between April 2014 and March 2017, successive patients with IS registered in the Wenzhou Stroke Registry Program (WSRP) were screened for eligibility for the present study ( Ye et al., 2015 ). The inclusion criteria for the patients were as follows: first-ever IS evaluated within 7 days, a MetS diagnosis, age   $\geq\!18$   years, and a Chinese Han ethnicity. The controls were recruited from the local population of residents who received physical examination at hospitals and were ageand sex-comparable to the patients. The inclusion criteria for the controls were as follows: a diagnosis of MetS, age   $\geq\!18$   years, no history of stroke or cardiovascular diseases, and a Chinese Han ethnicity.  

The exclusion criteria for the patients and controls included autoimmune diseases, malignancies, severe systemic diseases and serious chronic diseases. As a result, in total 447 IS patients and 438 controls were enrolled in this study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  

# 5.3. Definition of MetS  

The presence of MetS was determined using the revised criteria of the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Scientific Statement ( Grundy et al., 2005 ). Because waist circumference data were not available in the present study, we used a  $\mathtt{B M I}~\geq~25$   as a proxy for central obesity instead of a waist circumference   $\geq\!80~\mathrm{cm}$   in women and   $\geq\!90~\mathrm{cm}$   in men ( The Examination Committee of Criteria for 'Obesity Disease' in Japan, Japan Society for the Study of Obesity, 2002 ). The participants were considered to have MetS if they had   $\geq3$   of the following characteristics: (a) a  $\mathrm{BM}\,\geq\,25\$  ; (b) triglycerides   $\geq\!1.70\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$   (  $[150\;\mathrm{mg/dL})$   or the use of triglyceridelowering medication; (c) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol   $<1.30$  mmol/L (  $\mathrm{50\,mg/dL)}$  ) in women and  $<1.03\,\mathrm{mmol/L}$   (  $.40\,\mathrm{mg/dL})$   in men or the use of related medication; (d) systolic blood pressure  $^{\ge130\mathrm{~mmHg}}$   or diastolic blood pressure   $\geq\!85\,\mathrm{\mmHg}$   or the use of anti hypertensive medication; and (e) fasting blood glucose  $\geq\!5.6\ \mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{L}$   (  $[100\mathrm{\meg/dL})$   or the use of anti diabetic medication.  

# 5.4. Fine-mapping strategy  

A LD block of 62.52 kb (chr1: 152 664 293..152 706 812) in the IL6R  gene in Han Chinese was identified by the HapMap release 27 of the merged 3 phases ( http://www.hapmap.org ). The fine-mapping of the tag SNPs was analyzed by utilizing Haploview 4.0 software (Cambridge, USA) based on their possibility of tagging surrounding variants. The inclusion criteria for the selected SNPs were as follows: (1)  $r^{2}\,=\,0.8$  ; (2) a rate of genotype for overall   $\geq\!75\%$  ; (3)  $P$   value for HWE test  $P_{\cdot}$  -value  $>0.05$  ; and (4) a minor allele frequency  $(\mathrm{MAF})>0.05$  . The index SNPs, rs4845625 and rs8192284 were also included based on the results of former studies ( Sarwar et al., 2012; Deloukas et al., 2013 ). As a result, in total ten SNPs (rs4845617, rs6427641, rs12083537, rs7411976, rs4075015, rs4845618, rs4845625, rs4845374, rs8192284, and rs7514452) in the  IL6R  gene were selected for genotyping ( Table 2 ).  

# 5.5. Blood sample collection and genotyping  

According to the manufacturer’s instructions, a Magen DNA isolation kit was used to extract the genomic DNA (Magen DNA isolation kit, Guangzhou, China). The genotyping of the  IL6R  gene polymorphisms was conducted using SNPscan technology. In the light of the experimental standard procedures, the Center for Human Genetics Research, Shanghai Genesky Biotechnology Company supported the entire experimental process.  

# 5.6. Statistical analysis  

The differences in the categorical variables between the cases and the controls were compared by Chi-squared tests. HWE testing utilizing the exact chi-square test was performed to evaluate the genotypic distributions of the selected SNPs in the controls. Binary univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to evaluate the relationship between the risk of IS in the MetS patients and the selected SNPs. The variables adjusted for included age, sex, hypertension, hyperglycemia, dys lipid emi a, smoking, drinking. In the logistic regressions, each SNP was assessed by an additive model, a dominant model and a recessive model. In order to control the false positive error rate, Bonferroni correction was performed.  $\textit{P}<\,0.05/3$   (0.0167) was considered to be statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. Haploview 4.0 software (Cambridge, USA) was utilized to perform the linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis. Four gamete rules were used to define the block. The SNPstats software was utilized to reconstruct the haplotypes. Haplotypes with frequencies  $<0.01$   were omitted to reduce potential false positives in the haplotype analysis. GMDR 0.7 software was performed to evaluate the SNP–SNP interactions in the risk of IS. Power analyses were conducted by Power and Sample Size Program, version 3.0.43 (available at  http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/prevmed/ps ). IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 20.0; IBM Corporation, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. The differences were defined as significant at a  $P$  - value less than 0.05.
