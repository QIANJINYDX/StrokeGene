Purpose:  Ischemic stroke (IS), a serious cerebro vascular disease, greatly afects people’s health and life. Genetic factors are indispensable for the occurrence of IS. As a biomarker for IS, the  MMP-9  gene is widely involved in the path o physiological process of IS. This study attempts to ﬁnd out the relationship between  MMP-9 polymorphisms and IS susceptibility.  

Methods: A total of 700 IS patients and 700 healthy controls were recruited. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers of the  MMP-9  gene were genotyped by the MassARRAY analyzer. Multi factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was applied to generate SNP–SNP interaction. Furthermore, the relationship between genetic variations (allele and genotype) of the  MMP-9  gene and IS susceptibility was analyzed by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and  $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CIs).  

Results:  Our results demonstrated that rs2250889 could sign i cant ly increase the susceptibility to IS in the codominant, dominant, over dominant, and log-additive models   $(p<0.05)$  ). Further strat i cation analysis showed that compared with the control group, rs2250889 was associated with IS risk in diferent case groups (age, female, smoking, and non-drinking)  $(p<0.05)$  ). Based on MDR analysis, rs2250889 was the best model for predicting IS risk (cross-validation consistency: 10/10, OR  $=1.56$   (1.26–1.94),  $p<0.001$  ).  

Conclusion: Our study preliminarily conﬁrmed that SNP rs2250889 was sign i cant ly associated with susceptibility to IS.

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke, an acute cerebro vascular disease, is the main cause of death and long-term disability ( 1 ). The National Epidemiological Survey of Stroke in China (NESS-China) estimated that the death rate of stroke in China was 149.49 per 100,000, accounting for 1.57 million deaths in 2018 ( 2 ). There are two main types of strokes: ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS). Previous research studies have suggested that IS has become a major disease in China and one of the most important reasons for people’s disabilities ( 3 ). From this perspective, IS remains one of the biggest challenges that China is facing, and the need for a large number of research studies on the pathogen es is of IS is more than justiﬁed.

Although the pathogen es is of IS still has been debated, more and more studies have highlighted that the pathogen es is of IS is regulated by multiple factors, such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, drinking, and age ( 4 ). Recently, a report of Mendelian random iz ation has identiﬁed supported atrial brillat ion (AF), body mass index (BMI), smoking, blood pressure, white matter hyper intensity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as risk factors of IS ( 5 ). In addition, many studies have emphasized the inﬂuence of genetic factors on IS, and exactly, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in gene have a certain regulatory eﬀect on the occurrence of IS ( 4 ,  6 ). For example,  ALDH7A1  rs12514417 polymorphism may increase the risk of IS in individuals exposed to alcohol ( 7 ).  OPG  SNP T245G is associated with enhanced IS risk among the Chinese ( 8 ). At present, the research on postgenome-wide association study (GWAS) is ongoing, which mainly studies whether genetic variants associated with diﬀerent disease phenotypes exert their pathogen i city, and it is a means of exploring the relationship between gene polymorphisms and disease risk.  

Matrix metal lo protein as es (MMPs) are a group of zincdependent endo protein as es that regulate extracellular matrix (ECM)  via  pro teo lysis, cell adhesion, and cytokines ( 9 ). In addition, MMPs have been proven to participate in a series of biological processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, ang io genesis, and immune response ( 10 ,  11 ). MMP family members include MMP1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -12, -13, MT1-MMP, and MT3-MMP, which are expressed in various vascular tissues and cells ( 12 ). The matrix metal lo protein as e-9 ( MMP-9 ) gene is located in 20q13.12 and consists of 13 exons and 12 introns. It plays a role in the movement of vascular smooth muscle cells and the instability of at hero sclerotic plaque ( 13 ,  14 ). At present, a meta-analysis showed that  MMP9  and  MMP-12  gene polymorphisms may be risk factors for IS, whereas  MMP-1 ,  MMP-2 , and  MMP-3  were not associated with the risk of IS ( 15 ). Moreover, the latest study has found that rs243849 and rs14070 in  MMP-2  are sign i cant ly related to the risk of IS in the Shaanxi population from China ( 16 ). However, no signiﬁcant association between  MMP-9  genetic variants and intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) susceptibility was reported ( 17 ). We hypothesized that  MMP-9  gene variants may play diﬀerent roles in the occurrence of IS. Therefore, our case–control study aimed to investigate the relationship between  MMP-9  SNPs and the susceptibility to IS in the Northwest Chinese population to predict potential loci for IS risk.  

# 2. Methods  

# 2.1. Research participants  

The study participants, including 700 IS patients and 700 healthy controls, were consecutively recruited from Xi’an No. 3 Hospital from August 20 to December 22. The case group consisted of IS patients, who were admitted to the hospital within   $72\,\mathrm{h}$  after the symptom appeared and had focal neurological deﬁcit symptoms lasting for more than  $24\,\mathrm{h}$  . According to the diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO), all IS patients were conﬁrmed by at least two independent neurologists using brain computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and blood routine tests. Participants in the control group were normal and healthy, without other complicated cerebro vascular diseases, tumors, hypertension, diabetes, and other medical histories. All study participants were from the Northwest of China and provided written informed consent.  

# 2.2. Primer design  

By retrieving the NCBI ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/ ) and GeneBank databases combined with the MassArray analysis software, the primer sequence was designed. These primers were sent to Shangon Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) to synthesize for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process of MMP-9  SNPs ( Supplementary Table 1 ).  

# 2.3. Gene selecting and SNP genotyping  

The physical position of  MMP-9  on chromosome 20:46008908– 46016561 was obtained through the e!GRCh37 ( http://asia. ensembl.org/Homo sapiens/Info/Index ) database, and the table of MMP-9 variants was downloaded. SNPs were selected based on Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium   $\mathrm{(HWe)~>~0.01}$  , MAF    $>\ 0.05$  , and Min Genotype  $>75\%$   using Haploview software. We further combined MassARRAY primer design software,  $\mathrm{HKE}>0.05$  , MAF  $>\,0.05$  , and the call rate    $>95\%$   in our study population, for the selection of SNPs. Among the remaining SNPs, three candidate

SNPs (rs2250889, rs17577, and rs13925) in MMP-9 have previously been reported to be associated with stroke risk ( 18 ,  19 ) but have not been studied in a northwest Chinese Han population. Hence, this study was conducted to explore the correlation between these SNPs and IS risk in the northwest Chinese Han population. The dbSNP, Haploreg, and RegulomeDB databases were used for predicting the potential function of these SNPs.  

Approximately  $5\,\mathrm{mol}$  of peripheral blood samples were collected from each participant and placed in tubes containing ethylene dia mine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) in a    $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   refrigerator. Subsequently, genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using the GoldMag nanoparticles method (Gold Mag Co. Ltd., Xi’an, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) was used to determine the concentration and purity of DNA. Genotyping was performed in real-time using the MassARRAY software (v. 3.0.0.4). Data management and analysis were performed by the Agena MassARRAY analysis design software (v.4).  

# 2.4. Statistical analysis  

All statistical analyses in our study were performed using SPSS (v.22). The diﬀerences in demographic characteristics between IS patients and controls were estimated by the chi-square test for categorical variables and the student’s    $t$  -test for continuous variables. HWE was assessed using the    $\chi^{2}$    test with one degree of freedom. The strength of all associations between genetic variants in  MMP-9  and IS risk was evaluated by logistic regression models with odds ratios (ORs) with   $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals

 (CIs). Statistical analysis was performed using the online SNPStats

 (v.9.4) and PLINK (v.1.09) analysis software. Logistic regression analysis was introduced to study the eﬀect of each characteristic on the relationship between  MMP-9  variants and IS risk. The credibility of the signiﬁcant associations was assessed by falsepositive report probability (FPRP) analysis, with 0.2 as an FPRP threshold and 0.1 as a prior probability ( 20 ,  21 ). Multivariate dimension reduction (MDR) software was utilized to further evaluate SNP-SNP interaction and predict the best model related to IS risk ( 22 ). All  $\it{\Delta}p$  -values are two-sided, with a  $\it{\Delta}p$  -value of    $<$  0.05 indicating statistical sign i can ce, whereas the corrected    $\it{\Delta}p$  - value of    $<\,0.05/3$   was considered statistically signiﬁcant after the Bonferroni correction.

The detailed demographic characteristics of the case and control groups that were included are shown in  Table 1 . A total of 1,400 subjects were selected, including 700 IS patients and 700 healthy controls. There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the two groups in gender, age, smoking status, and drinking status   $(p>0.05)$  .

# 3.2. Results of  MMP-9  gene polymorphism and IS risk  

Three SNPs (rs2250889, rs17577, and rs13925) of  MMP9  were successfully screened, and the basic information about them was demonstrated ( Table 2 ). Database analysis presented that the potential functions of these SNPs might be related to promoter/histone marks, DNAse, protein-bound motifs changed, eQTL, and transcription factor binding. In addition, the association between three SNPs in  MMP-9  and IS susceptibility was analyzed under ﬁve genetic models (codominant, dominant, recessive, over dominant, and log-additive), as illustrated in  Figure 1 . We found that rs2250889 sign i cant ly increased susceptibility to IS under the codominant (CG vs. CC,   $\mathrm{{OR}=1.49}$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.20-$  1.86,  $\textstyle p\,=\,0.001$  ), dominant (CG-GG vs. CC,   $\mathrm{{OR}=1.42}$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}\;=\;1.15{-}1.75$  ,  $\textstyle p\ =\ 0.001$  ), over dominant (CC-CG vs. GG,

  $\mathrm{{OR}=1.48}$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,1.20–1.84$  ,  $p\,=\,0.0003.$  ), and log-additive

  $\mathrm{{(OR=1.49}}$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.20–1.86$  ,  $p=0.017$  ) models. However, no signiﬁcant association of rs17577 and rs13925 with IS risk was revealed according to our statistical results. The results are presented in  Supplementary Table 2 . The signiﬁcant association between rs2250889 and IS risk under the codominant, dominant, and over dominant models still existed after Bonferroni correction.  

# 3.3. Strat i cation analysis by demographic characteristics  

The stratiﬁed analysis by gender (male and female), age, drinking, and smoking was conducted to further analyze the correlation between selected SNPs and IS risk, as shown in  Table 3 . The eﬀect of rs2250889 on the risk of IS varied obviously with age. More precisely, rs2250889 played a risk-increasing role in IS in individuals aged    ${\leq}55$   years under four genetic models

 (codominant:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.64$  ,  $p=0.009$  ; dominant:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.57$  ,  $\mathscr{p}=$   $0.004;$   over dominant:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.61$  ,  $p=0.002$  ; and log-additive: OR

  $=\,1.33$  ,  $p\,=\,0.026$  ) and among people older than 55 years old, the risk-increasing eﬀect of rs2250889 on IS susceptibility under two models (dominant:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.42$  ,    $p=0.045$   and over dominant:  $\mathrm{OR}\,=\,1.53$  ,  $\textstyle p\,=\,0.0177$  ) was observed. Furthermore, rs2250889 was associated with an increased susceptibility to IS in women

 (codominant:   $\mathrm{OR}=2.13$  ,  $p=0.001$  ; dominant:   $\mathrm{{OR}=1.91}$  ,  $\mathscr{p}=$  0.001; over dominant:   $\mathrm{{OR}=2.11}$  ,  $p=0.000$  ; log-additive:   $\mathrm{OR}=$  1.44,  $p=0.0177$  ) but not statistically diﬀerent in men. Ultimately, the analysis stratiﬁed by smoking status revealed that rs2250889 exerted a risk-increasing eﬀect on IS in smokers (codominant:  $\mathrm{{OR}=1.58}$  ,    $p\,=\,0.011$  ; dominant:   $\mathrm{{OR}=1.48}$  ,    $p\,=\,0.014;$   and over dominant:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.61$  ,  $p=0.003\$  ). Among the non-drinking subjects, SNP rs2250889 was sign i cant ly correlated with IS susceptibility under four models (codominant:   $\mathrm{{OR}=2.04}$  ,  $p=$  0.0001; dominant:   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,1.93}$  ,    $\mathit{p}~<~0.0001$  ; over dominant: OR

  $=1.95$  ,  $\textstyle p\,<\,0.0001$  ; and log-additive:   $\mathrm{{OR}=1.54}$  ,  $p\,=\,0.0005)$  . After Bonferroni correction, rs2250889 was associated with an increased IS risk in the subgroup aged    $\leq\,51$   years (codominant, dominant, and over dominant), women (codominant, dominant, and over dominant), smokers (codominant, dominant, and over dominant), and non-drinkers (codominant, dominant, over dominant, and log-additive), respectively. Unfortunately, there were no signiﬁcant associations between other SNPs (rs17577, rs13925) and IS risk in terms of age, gender, smoking, and drinking ( Supplementary Table 3 ).  

# 3.4. Strat i cation analysis by complications  

The relationship between MMP-9 SNPs and IS risk was also investigated in the subgroups of IS patients

with/without hypertension or diabetes, as shown in  Table 4 and  Supplementary Table 4 . Compared with healthy controls, rs2250889 was related to the risk of IS in IS patients with hypertension (codominant:   $\mathrm{{OR}\ =\ 1.54}$  ,    $\textstyle p\,=\,0.002$  ; dominant:  $\mathrm{{OR}=1.47}$  ,  $p\,=\,0.002$  ; over dominant:   $\mathrm{OR}\,=\,1.53$  ,  $p\,=\,0.001$  ; and log-additive:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.26$  ,  $\textstyle p=0.018.$  ) and IS patients without hypertension (over dominant:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.42$  ,  $p=0.022$  ). Moreover, rs2250889 was found to be related to an increased risk of IS in IS patients without diabetes (codominant:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.55$  ,  $p=0.001$  ; dominant:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.46$  ,  $p=0.001$  ; over dominant:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.55,p<$  0.001; and log-additive:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.24$  ,  $p=0.024$  ). After Bonferroni correction, rs2250889 might be a risk factor for IS patients with hypertension (codominant, dominant, and over dominant) and IS patients without diabetes (codominant, dominant, and over dominant). However, other SNPs (rs17577, rs13925) were not sign i cant ly associated with IS risk in terms of hypertension and diabetes.  

# 3.5. FPRP analysis of the positive ﬁndings  

FPRP analysis was performed to conﬁrm whether the signiﬁcant ﬁndings deserved attention ( Table 5 ). At the prior probability level of 0.01, the signiﬁcant association of  MMP-9 rs2250889 with IS risk remained noteworthy in the overall analysis  $(\mathrm{FPRP\,=\,0.074}$  , 0.125, and 0.070). Moreover, the association of MMP-9  rs2250889 with IS risk was also positive in the subgroup aged  $\le55$   years, women, smokers, and non-drinkers at the prior probability level of 0.01.  

# 3.6. MDR analysis of  MMP-9  SNPs  

The multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis was carried out to ﬁnd the relationship between the SNP-SNPs interactions in IS occurrence. The signiﬁcant combinations of variables were selected based on the entropy measure to assess the information gain (IG) associated with attribute interaction. The patterns of entropy recapitulate the main and/or interaction eﬀects of the paired combination of each attribute. As demonstrated in Figure 2 , rs17577 and rs13925 had a synergistic eﬀect with the IG value of  $0.16\%$  , and rs2250889 and rs17577 had strong redundancy with the IG value related to IS of  $-0.05\%$  . More importantly, we found that rs2250889 was the best model for predicting IS risk in  Table 6  (Cross-Validation Consistency: 10/10,   $\mathrm{OR}{}=1.48(1.20-$  1.83),  $p=0.0003$  ).  

# 4. Discussion  

Ischemic stroke is a type of disease that causes serious harm to the human body and cognition. It is particularly important to pay attention to clinical treatment and diagnosis. In our experiments, 1,400 subjects were recruited and statistically analyzed to report the association between  MMP-9  SNPs (rs2250889, rs17577, and rs13925) and IS susceptibility. In the overall analysis, only rs2250889 was sign i cant ly associated with IS susceptibility. In a stratiﬁed analysis, rs2250889 could increase the risk of IS in subjects of diﬀerent ages, women, smokers, and non-drinkers. Moreover, rs2250889 might be a risk factor for IS patients with hypertension and IS patients without diabetes. MDR showed that rs2250889 was the best model for predicting IS risk. Taken together, our ﬁndings are the ﬁrst to discuss the relationship between  MMP-9  rs2250889 and IS susceptibility and to evaluate the diagnostic sign i can ce of this SNP. Rs3749966, a missense variant [R (Arg)  $>\mathrm{~P~}$   (Pro)], might be associated with promoter/histone marks, DNAse, proteinbound, motifs changed, eQTL, and transcription factor binding. Therefore, we speculated that  MMP-9  rs2250889 might inﬂuence IS occurrence by regulating the expression level of  MMP-9 , which certainly requires experimental ver i cation.  

As a member of the MMP family,  MMP-9  can regulate the balance of ECM and participate in multiple important biological processes. It has been reported that  MMP-9  is closely related to intra cranial aneurysms, atherosclerosis, ischemic brain injury, and other diseases ( 23 ). Recently, studies have found that  MMP-9 polymorphism is associated with intra cranial aneurysm ( 24 ). More studies have detected the expression of  MMP-9  in the serum and brain tissues of IS patients and found that it is sign i cant ly high ( 25 ,  26 ). In addition, the TT genotype of  MMP-9 -1562C/T has been proven to be a risk factor for hemorrhagic complications after thr ombo ly tic therapy for acute IS (AIS) ( 27 ). More importantly, in a case–control study,  MMP-9  SNP rs3918242 was associated with the increased risk of IS in the Asian population, but there was no such ﬁnding in the Caucasian population ( 28 ). Similarly, Fan et al. have indicated that  MMP-9  rs17576 is associated with an increased IS

risk in the Han Hakka population ( 29 ). Finally, our study concluded that  MMP-9  rs2250889 sign i cant ly increased the susceptibility to IS in the northwest Chinese population. This shows that the SNPs of  MMP-9  are diﬀerent in diﬀerent races.  

Age and sex exhibit complex eﬀects on IS risk and path o physiology. Aging is the most important un modi able risk factor for IS. Compared with young stroke patients, the mortality and morbidity of elderly stroke patients are higher, and functional recovery is slower. Of note, the role of gender in IS risk is aﬀected by age ( 30 ). Some studies have explored the impact of SNPs at diﬀerent ages on IS risk in people of diﬀerent ages. For instance, PITX2  rs6817105 sign i cant ly increased the risk of stroke in people aged over 65 years ( 31 ). In this study,  MMP-9  rs2250889 was related to the increased risk of IS in subgroups of diﬀerent ages. This may be due to diﬀerences in  MMP-9  SNPs. Certainly, we would not rule out a trend of getting younger of IS patients. From the perspective of gender, a recent study has revealed that young women (18–45 years old) may have a   $44\%$   higher risk of IS than their male counterparts ( 32 ). Our research also revealed that SNP rs2250889 could promote the occurrence of IS in women. Tobacco smoking can worsen IS prognosis by increasing blood–brain barrier permeability and accelerating the formation of cerebral edema ( 33 ). Drinking frequency may be also tied to the risk of IS ( 34 ). In terms of hierarchical analysis of other characteristics (smoking and drinking), similar to some studies, the genotypes rs3793917 and rs2672587 have a cumulative risk of IS in smokers ( 8 ). Our study also concluded that rs2250889 would increase the susceptibility to IS in smokers. More interestingly, the study found that  HTRA1 rs2268350 was sign i cant ly associated with IS in drinkers ( 8 ). In contrast, in this study, rs2250889 was related to the increased susceptibility to IS in non-drinkers, suggesting that rs2250889 may be a new locus on  MMP-9  for predicting IS risk.  

Com or bidi ties are a hallmark of IS, which both increase the incidence of IS and worsen the prognosis. Hypertension

is common in IS patients and the most important modiﬁable risk factor for IS ( 35 ). Another potential risk factor for stroke pathogen es is is diabetes mellitus, which has been shown to be associated with increased mortality in stroke ( 36 ). In this study, compared with healthy controls, rs2250889 was related to the risk of IS in IS patients with hypertension, without hypertension, and without diabetes, respectively.  

Although we have discussed the results described above, several potential limitations in this study should be noted. First, our sample size is small, so we need to expand the sample size to further verify our experiment. Second, the result of this research is not general iz able as it was found in a speciﬁc group of the Chinese Han population. Third, our experiment preliminarily determined the impact of  MMP-9  on the susceptibility to IS. In subsequent experiments, we will further verify the role of MMP-9  in the occurrence of IS through the quantitative realtime (qPCR) and Western blot (WB) experiments. Finally, IS is a complex disease. Further analysis of the impact of  MMP-9 on the pathogen es is of IS in cell and animal models is worthy of attention.  

# 5. Conclusion  

In summary, our research preliminarily determined the correlation between  MMP-9  gene polymorphisms (rs2250889, rs17577, and rs13925) and IS risk, especially SNP rs2250889, which provides a theoretical basis for studying the impact of  MMP-9  on the pathogen es is of IS.
