Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by endo the li al nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme is a critical regulator of cerebro vascular  homeostasis. Genetic variability of G894T and intronic 4ab polymorphism in  eNOS  could affect the expression and activity  of eNOS enzyme, modulating NO levels in endothelium. This results in endo the li al dysfunction, which can contribute to the  pathogen es is of ischemic stroke. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association of  eNOS  genetic polymorphisms  (G894T and 4ab) with the occurrence of ischemic stroke through various genetic models. Both polymorphisms were  genotyped in 120 ischemic stroke patients diagnosed with MRI and other ancillary techniques and 101 control subjects free  of neurological abnormalities, using PCR-RFLP technique and direct PCR respectively. The genotypes of both G894T and  4ab variants were found to be in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium for cases and controls. The significant variation was observed  in the genotypic and allelic frequencies for G894T polymorphism between cases and controls, indicating the association of  G894T variability with ischemic stroke. However, the difference between cases and controls was insignificant for  eNOS  4ab  polymorphism with regard to genotypic and allelic distribution. Except for recessive model, both dominant (GT/TT  vs.  GG)  and co-dominant (TT  vs.  GT or GT  vs.  GG) models indicated nearly two-fold and 1.93 increased risk of ischemic stroke for  G894T polymorphism, but none of them suggested the influence of  eNOS  4ab polymorphism on ischemic stroke susceptibility.  Haplotype analysis revealed the higher frequency of GT-4bb genotype combination in cases as compared to controls, but  without significant difference. The study concluded that SNP G894T variant is associated with ischemic stroke and might  contribute to ischemic stroke susceptibility in North Indians. However, this outcome needs to be confirmed by studies with  large sample size.

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke remains the third leading cause of death and  the most familiar disease leading to functional impairments in the elderly, throughout the world (Roger et al.  2011). The incidence of stroke is rapidly rising in low and  middle-income countries. WHO estimates that by 2050,  nearly   $80\%$   of stroke cases in world would occur mainly  in India and China (World Health Organization 2005).  

Of all strokes,   $87\%$   are ischemic,  $10\%$   are intracere- bral and  $3\%$   are sub ara ch noid hemorrhage (Roger et al.  2011). Along with some conventional risk factors such  as hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking and obesity, common genetic polymorphisms with possible effects on function or protein  expression within genes have been projected as a possible genetic risk factors, contributing to the heterogeneous phenotypic profile of ischemic stroke. However,  the genes concerned with pathogen es is of ischemic  stroke are largely understudied (Hassan et al. 2004,  Humpheries and Morgan 2004, Dichgans 2007).  

eNOS  (endo the li al nitric oxide synthase) gene located on chromosome 7q35–36 contains 26 exons spanning approximately  $21~\mathrm{k}\mathrm{b}$   of genomic DNA. It encodes  eNOS enzyme playing a crucial in the availability and  exchange rate of nitric oxide (Wang and Wang 2000,  Watt an a pita yak ul et al. 2001). Nitric oxide (NO), an  endothelium-derived product of eNOS, is widely  known to be a potent va so dil at or, anti thr ombo tic, antiinflammatory, anti-pro life rat ive and regulates blood  flow (Loscalzo 1995, Endres et al. 2004), all these  actions being mediated by the activation of soluble  guanylate cyclase and consequent increase in the concentration of cyclic GMP in target cells (Waldman and  Murad 1988). As per the clinical and experimental data  on the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke, endo the li al  dysfunction due to reduced bio availability of NO plays  a major role in vascular alteration (Yetik-Anacak and  Catravas 2006). The clinical trials in  eNOS  knockout  mice suggested that  eNOS  derived NO is needed for  the vascular recruitment during ischemia and experimental inhibition of nitric oxide synthase accelerates  the formation of early at hero sclerotic lesions (Leeson  et al. 2002). Similarly, decline in NO release predisposes humans to stroke, hypertension, thrombosis,  vasospasm, and atherosclerosis (Petros et al. 1991,  Calver et al. 1994, Cayatte et al. 1994, Markus et al.  2000), while restoration of NO activity induces the  regression of preexisting intimal lesions (Cheng et al.  2008).  

eNOS  is widely studied candidate gene for stroke  susceptibility and genetic variations in this   could alter  the expression and activity of eNOS enzyme, and  therefore contribute to the development of ischemic  stroke. Among investigated genetic variations in  eNOS ,  G894T and intronic 4ab repeat polymorphisms have  received the most attention. G894T variant in exon 7 of  the  eNOS  leads to a change of glutamate to aspartate at  site 298 and is said to have increased susceptibility to  cleavage of eNOS enzyme (Joshi et al. 2007). The  mutant T allele was reported to be associated with  ischemic stroke (Berger et al. 2007). The intronic 4ab  variant, a 27bp variable number of tandem repeats  (VNTR) has been widely studied. A report by Chinese  investigators indicated 4a allele of  eNOS  4ab polymorphism to be associated with ischemic stroke (Hou et al.  2001). Due to its location in the non-coding region, its  chances of being associated with disease traits are  minimal. In spite, this intronic variant is shown to  genetically contribute to basal levels of plasma NO  (Markus et al. 1998). There are limited published  reports on the association of G894T and intronic 4ab  polymorphism with the risk of ischemic stroke from  North India. Hence, our main aim was to investigate  the association of  eNOS  genetic variability with ischemic stroke by assessing the comparative distribution  of  eNOS  variants (G894T, 4ab) in ischemic stroke  patients and healthy controls free of neurological diseases.  

# METHODOLOGY  

Punjab with an area of   $50{,}362\,\mathrm{km}^{2}$   and population of  277.04 lakhs is situated in North India with population  density of 550 per  $\mathrm{km}^{2}$  . The cases for the present study  were collected from Uppal Neuro hospital in Amritsar  district of Punjab and controls from various areas  around Amritsar, the population and median density of  population of Amritsar district being 24,90,891 and  550 per   $\mathrm{km}^{2}$   respectively. This hospital based casecontrol study focused on 120 adult ischemic stroke  patients (61 females and 59 males) enrolled in Uppal  Neuro hospital, where they were clinically and radiologically (CT/MRI) diagnosed with ischemic stroke.  The cases with cerebral hemorrhage, transient ischemic attacks and hyper or hypo thyroid disorders were  excluded from the study.  

For controls, a total of 101 healthy subjects (49  females and 52 males) with no clinical history of cerebro vascular disease or present neurological abnormalities were randomly recruited from various areas  around Amritsar. Stroke free status for the control  population was determined using Questionnaire for  Verifying Stroke Free Status (QVSFS) validated by  Jones and others (2001). Informed consent from each  participant was taken prior to sample collection.  Institutional ethical committee of Guru Nanak Dev  University (Number 94/HG) approved the study. The  conventional risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, alcohol, smoking) were  recorded as a part of patient’s clinical history. The  examined study group represented mixed population,  comprising of Sikhs and Hindus. The average ratio of  con sanguine o us marriages in the studied population is  noticed to be zero in detailed pedigree analysis of the  subjects. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole  blood samples using the standard phenol-chloroform  method (Adeli and Ogbonna 1990) and stored at   $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for further molecular analysis.  

# GENOTYPIC ANALYSIS  

# eNOS  G894T polymorphism  

G894T genetic polymorphism was determined using  polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length  polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique using primer  pairs:  $5^{\circ}$  -A AG GC AG GAGA C AGT GG AT GG A  $_3\mathrm{{}^{\circ}}$   (sense)  and   $5'$  -CCC A GTC A AT CCC TTT G GT GC TC A  $\cdot3^{\circ}$   (anti- sense) with slight modifications for PCR conditions  (Shimaski et al. 1998).  

For G894T genotypic analysis, the amplified PCR  products were analysed on   $2.2\%$   ethidium bromide  stained agarose gel, followed by digestion of PCR  products with restriction enzyme  Dpn II  according to  the manufacturer instructions (New England Biolabs,  Beverly, MA). The restriction digestion products were  analysed on   $2.8\%$   ethidium bromide stained agarose  gel. The DNA fragment from TT homozygote was  digested into 160 and 88bp fragments, while for undigested GG homozygote, a single 248bp fragment was  observed on the gel.  

# eNOS  4ab Polymorphism  

eNOS  4ab genetic polymorphism was determined  using direct PCR technique with following primer  sequences:  A GG CCC TAT GG TAG T GCC TTT-3’ 

 (sense) and   $5'$  -T CT CT TAG TG CT GT G GT CAC-3’ 

 (antisense) with slight modifications for PCR conditions (Wang et al. 1996). The amplified fragments  were separated on  $2.5\%$   ethidium bromide stained agarose gel. The genotypes to the subjects were assigned  on the basis of expected fragments obtained after PCR  on   $2.3\%$   ethidium bromide stained agarose gel. Three  genotypes namely homozygous 4aa (393bp) and 4bb  (420bp) and heterozygous 4ab (420bp, 393bp) were  observed on gel.  

A negative control without DNA template was  included in each reaction. The genotyping was done  blindly without the knowledge of the clinical status of  the subjects. Ten percent of DNA samples were reanalysed and results of both sets were   $100\%$   concordant.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Continuous variables were expressed as mean and  standard deviation. Categorical variables were  expressed as percentages. Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium  (HWE) was tested by comparing the observed to  expected genotype frequencies in cases and controls  using Chi-square  $(\chi2)$   test. The difference in allelic and  genotypic frequency distribution between cases and  controls was evaluated through Chi-square   $(\chi2)$   test.  The relative risk of genotypes and alleles was determined by odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals   $(95\%$   CI). The p values were two tailed, and statistical significance was accepted as   $\mathsf{p{\le}0.05}$  . All the  statistical values were calculated using SPSS (Version  16, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).  

# Results  

This case-control study consisted of 120 ischemic  stroke patients (61 females and 59 males) and 101 agematched unrelated healthy control individuals (49  females and 52 males). The mean age was 

  $62.1{\pm}11.74\$   years (range: 35–90 years) for the cases and 

  $58.03{\pm}10.75\$   years (35–85 years) for the controls.  

# Association between  eNOS  polymorphisms and  ischemic stroke  

Genotypic analysis of the two polymorphisms 

 (G894T and 4ab) of  eNOS  is presented in Table I and II  respectively. The observed genotype frequencies of   G894T and 4ab variants were found to be in Hardy  Weinberg equilibrium   $\mathrm{(p{>}0.05)}$  . The alleles 894T and  4a were considered as rare and their relationship with  ischemic stroke was evaluated with various genetic  models (dominant, co dominant and recessive models).  

Table I summarizes the genotypic and allelic distributions of  eNOS  G894T polymorphism in ischemic  stroke patients and controls. Both cases and controls  were found to be in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium  (cases:   $\tt p{=}0.142$  ; controls:   $\tt p{=}0.901$  ). In the present  study,  $70\%$   of cases with ischemic stroke have homozygous wild type genotype (GG), while   $25\%$   and   $5\%$    cases were having heterozygous (GT) and homozygous  variant (TT) genotype respectively. Among control  group,   $69.2\%$  ,   $14.2\%$   and   $0.8\%$   showed GG, GT and  TT genotypes respectively, with the minor allele frequency being   $9.4\%$  . The genotypic distribution of  eNOS  G894T polymorphism showed significant difference between cases and controls   $(\chi^{2}{=}5.976$  ,   $\mathtt{p}{=}0.05_{,}$  )  and similarly the difference of allelic distribution  between cases and controls was also observed to be  significant   $(\chi^{2}{=}6.04$  ,  $\tt p{=}0.014$  ). There was a suggestive  evidence of an association of G894T variant in dominant model (GT/TT  vs.  GG:   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.98$  ,   $95\%$   CI   $1.04-$  3.76,   $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.034)$  ) as well as in co dominant model (GT/ GG  vs.  TT:  $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.93$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.10–3.39,  $\mathtt{p}{=}0.017\$  ) with  the occurrence of ischemic stroke among North Indians.  The recessive model (GG/GT  vs.  TT) also indicated  weak association of  eNOS  G894T variant with ischemic stroke   $(\mathrm{OR}{=}5.26$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.62–44.46,  $\mathsf{p}\mathrm{=}\ensuremath{0.072}$  ).

n – number of subjects, Figs in parentheses represents frequency of each genotype; OR – odds ratio; CI – confidence interval; \*p<0.05 was considered  

Table II represents the genotypic and allelic distribution of  eNOS  4ab polymorphism in ischemic stroke  patients and controls. Nearly,   $82.5\%$   ischemic stroke  patients exhibited 4bb genotype, whereas   $23.3\%$   and   $4.2\%$   patients were having 4ab and 4aa genotypes  respectively. Among controls the genotypic distribution was:   $76.2\%$   for 4bb,   $20.8\%$   for 4ab and   $2.9\%$   for  4aa genotype, with the minor allele frequency being   $13.4\%$  . No significant difference was observed between  cases and controls with respect to genotypic   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.785)$    and allelic frequency   $\mathrm{(p{=}0.465)}$  ) distribution. Also,  none of the genetic models suggested any association  of  eNOS  4ab polymorphism with ischemic stroke outcome.  

To study the association between ischemic stroke and  possible combinations of the  eNOS  polymorphisms  (G894T and 4ab), we performed haplotype analysis presented in Table III. The result of haplotype analysis did not  reveal any significant risk of ischemic stroke in any combination. Although the proportion of GT-4bb genotype  combination was higher in cases   $(21.7\%)$   as compared to  controls   $(15.8\%)$  , the difference between two groups was  noted to be statistically non-significant   $\tt(p{=}0.13)$  .  

In line with observations of a significant disparity in  the distribution of  eNOS  variants among various populations, the influence of ethnicity on the prevalence of  gene polymorphisms is observed in our study. We carried out comparative analysis of rare allele frequencies  in our control population with the reported frequencies  from other ethnicities which indicated marked difference in the prevalence of minor alleles of the two variants, when comparing the North Indian population  with the documented frequencies in other ethnicities  (Table IV). The T allele frequency of G894T polymorphism in North Indian population was  $9.4\%$   that varied  extensively from Caucasians   $(27.4–43.8\%)$   and AfricanAmericans   $(15–15.5\%)$   However, it was comparable  with Japanese   $(10.2\%)$  , Koreans   $(8.7–9\%)$   and Chinese   $(7.9\mathrm{-}11.49\%)$  . There was also a prominent contrast in  the frequencies of 4a allele in our healthy controls 

  $(13.4\%)$   from African-Americans   $(27–29.2\%)$  , Chinese 

  $(7.8\mathrm{-}9.6\%)$   and even from South Indians  $(21.5\%)$  , but it  was quite similar to Koreans, Japanese and  Caucasians.  

# DISCUSSION  

We conducted a case-control study to demonstrate  the association of  eNOS  G894T and intronic 4ab variants with the risk of ischemic stroke. It was hypothesized that exonic G894T and intronic 4ab polymorphism could have an important impact on ischemic  stroke predisposition through different genetic models.  

Various investigators around the world have carried  out the studies regarding the contribution of  eNOS   G894T and 4ab polymorphisms to ischemic stroke  pathogen es is, but the outcome of these studies remained  inconclusive. In the present case-control study, we  investigated the genotypic and allelic frequencies of   G894T polymorphism and the findings suggested that  there are indeed significant differences between cases  and controls with regard to genotypic and allelic distribution. Odds ratio suggested that carriage of 894TT  variant of  eNOS  increases the ischemic stroke risk of  an individual by 1-fold. 894T allele was found to be  associated with increased risk of developing ischemic  stroke in North Indians, as the difference of allelic  frequency distribution between patients and controls  was highly significant   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.014)$  ). Our data was consistent with the findings of various studies that reported  the strong association of G894T variant with ischemic  stroke in Bahrain (Saidi et al. 2010) Asian (Wang et al.  2013a, Guo et al. 2014), French Caucasian (Elbaz et al.  2000), Moroccan (Diakite et al. 2014) and Chinese (Lv  et al. 2004) populations. The positive association  between this polymorphism and cerebral small vessel  disease has also been reported by Hassan et al. (2000)  and Henskens et al. (2005). Similarly, genotypic analysis in Italian population found G894T polymorphism  as an independent risk factor for carotid at hero scl erosis (Lembo et al. 2001). Conversely, some studies did  not notice any significant difference of allelic and  genotypic frequency between ischemic stroke patients  and controls (Cheng et al. 2008, Ellul et al. 2011), thus  indicating no association between G894T polymorphism and ischemic stroke. Similarly, some studies  also indicated lack of contribution of G894T polymorphism to ischemic stroke susceptibility in Singapore  (Moe et al. 2008), Turkish (Guldiken et al. 2009),  Hungarian (Szolnoki et al. 2005) and in white (Markus  et al. 1998) population.  

Due to functional relevance of   G894T variant and  published reports on its association with ischemic  stroke, several studies positively correlated G894T  polymorphism with various cardiovascular diseases  including ischemic heart disease (Casas et al. 2004),  coronary artery dysfunction (Nakayama et al. 1999),

hypertension (Periaswamy et al. 2008, Zhao et al.  2008) and ischemic stroke (Diakite et al. 2014). The  functional consequence of G894T polymorphism has  been suggested to be due to the observed genotypedriven alterations in basal and shear induced activation, altered localization of protein at caveolae and  consequential impairment in the co-ordination of the  regulatory cycle of eNOS enzyme (Joshi et al. 2007).  The subjects with TT genotype of G894T variant have  been reported to have low levels of   $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{x}}$   as compared  to individuals with GT and GG genotypes (Akhter  et  al. 2014). Furthermore, Senthil and coworkers  (2005) found that endo the li al cells separated from  patients and having TT of G894T or 4aa of intronic 4ab  polymorphism expressed higher levels of  eNOS  mRNA,  while lower level of eNOS protein, compared with GG  or 4bb genotype. Similarly, a study conducted by Saini  et al. (2011)   on 60 patients of CAD also indicated that  patients had significantly lower levels of NO compared  with controls in all G894T genotypes; however, patients  with 894GG genotypes had significantly higher levels  of NO as compared to patients with 894GT genotypes.  Also, the findings by Metzger and others (2005, 2007,  2011) in previous studies suggested that  eNOS  variants  combined within a specific haplotype, significantly  affected NO formation, thus considerably impacting  in   vivo  NO bio availability in healthy white and black  subjects. These evidences suggested that accelerated  degradation of eNOS is an important mechanism for  G894T and VNTR polymorphism to influence   eNOS  activity.  

The relationship of   G894T polymorphism with  ischemic stroke was further assessed through three  genetic models (dominant, co-dominant and recessive). On analyzing these genetic models, dominant  and co-dominant models revealed the significant association of G894T polymorphism with ischemic stroke,  reflecting 1.98 and 1.93 fold increased risk of an individual predisposition to ischemic stroke respectively  that might affect an individual’s susceptibility to ischemic stroke   $(\mathsf{p}^{<0.05}$   for both). The recessive genetic  model also deciphered some extent of association of  G894T variant with ischemic stroke, but that was noted  to be weak association   $\scriptstyle(\mathtt{p}=0.07)$  ). Thus, our study was  in agreement with the reports published by Saidi and  colleagues (2010) and Tao and Chen (2009) in which  all the three models might act as a contributing factor  in pathogen es is of ischemic stroke. Likewise, the two  independent case-control studies in German population (Berger et al. 2007) and the comprehensive meta- analysis in Asians concluded that dominant and codominant models were associated with elevated risk of  ischemic stroke for G894T polymorphism but not with  recessive models and these results remained same in  Chinese even after sub-group analysis (Wang et al.  2013b).  

For  eNOS  4ab intronic variant, the proportion of 4aa  variant genotype in cases   $(4.2\%)$   and controls   $(2.9\%)$    was comparable; hence no correlation was observed  between intronic 4ab polymorphism and ischemic  stroke susceptibility, as presented in Table III. Similar  observations have been made by several studies conducted across different populations that also reported  no association between intronic   4ab polymorphism  and ischemic stroke (Markus et al. 1998, Grewal et al.  2007, Moe et al. 2008, Tao and Chen 2009).  

The polymorphisms in the non-coding region of   eNOS  could also play a role in regulation of gene  expression. Intronic 4ab polymorphism in non-coding  region may also be involved in increased disease risk  or could be a marker in linkage d is equilibrium with  relevant functional changes. It was reported that  intronic 4ab  eNOS  locus has a substantial effect on the  variance of plasma NO levels (Wang et al. 1996).  Lower NO plasma levels were demonstrated for 4a  allele carriers in Asians and African-Americans (Yoon  et al. 2000, Salimi et al. 2008) and  eNOS  4ab polymorphism has been correlated with ischemic stroke in  some American, African and Asian studies (Yahashi et  al. 1998, Hou et al. 2001, Howard et al. 2005, Majumdar  et al. 2010, Munshi et al. 2010, Saidi et al. 2010).  However, the results are still indecisive regarding the  contribution of intronic 4ab variant in ischemic stroke  predisposition. Various reports have observed the high  fold increased risk in 4a allele carriers compared to  individuals carrying 4b allele (Hou et al. 2001, Pu and  Tao 2003, Zhang 2004, Guo 2014). On the contrary,  Shi and others (2008) correlated the  eNOS  4bb genotype with increased risk of ischemic stroke.  

In genetic studies, haplotype analysis has been  viewed as powerful strategy, eliminating the inconsistencies commonly found in studies analyzing single  polymorphisms. Likewise, studies have reported the  significant contribution of  eNOS  haplotypes to variation in NO formation, as C-4b-Glu haplotypes have  been found to be more prevalent in subjects with low  circulating concentrations of nitric oxide products  (Metzger et al. 2005, 2007, 2011). Since, the present  study did not evaluate the nitrite and nitrate concentrations in subjects, we could not perform such analysis.  Conversely, haplotype based analysis of possible geno  

![](images/c6b8b36b72458ec87e035d7dded0eab42921fd7e382fef33c4b55890e287a59c.jpg)  

type combinations in the present study did not reveal  any significant association of gene variants with ischemic stroke outcome.  

The prevalence of  eNOS  polymorphisms has been  established for Caucasians, African-Americans and  Asian populations. However, limited information is  available on Indian population. On performing comparative analysis of allele frequencies in our control  population with the reported frequencies from other  ethnicities, we observed marked variation in the prevalence of minor alleles of the two variants in North  Indian population. The prevalence of 894T allele is low  in Japanese and African-Americans than in Caucasians   $(27.4–43.8\%)$  . However, the frequency of 894T allele in  our control population was closer to Asians (Japanese,  Koreans and Chinese). Among Asians, 894T allele has  been known to increase the risk of ischemic stroke  (Wang et al. 2013b). Likewise, 894T allele in North  Indian population was found to be associated with  ischemic stroke. There was also a prominent contrast  of 4a allele frequency in the studied population from  African-Americans and even from South Indians.  Among South Indians females, 4a allele has been  reported to confer the increased risk of ischemic stroke  (Majumdar et al. 2010).  

There are number of drugs that may interact with  eNOS  polymorphisms and significantly affect the drug  response and modify clinical outcomes. However, the  present study could not carry out such interactive  analysis, due to non-availability of sufficient data on  usage of drugs by patients. There is substantial evidence that many of the therapeutic approaches to the  treatment of stroke, such as statins, rosi gl it a zone etc.  exert their effect by increasing eNOS stimulation and  increased expression of eNOS (Endres et al. 2004,  Laufs et al. 2000). The pleiotropic and beneficial  effects of these drugs have been observed to be modulated by single nucleotide polymorphisms in  eNOS   gene. Previous  in vitro  and p harm a co genetic studies  showed that T-786 C polymorphism in  eNOS  modulates the effects of a trova statin on NO bio availability  and oxidative stress (Nagassaki et al. 2006). Similarly,  the results from a clinical study suggested that  eNOS   polymorphisms apparently contribute to better responses to enalapril in hypertensive s (Silva et al. 2013).  

Though the data is available on various aspects of  the development of stroke in different ethnic populations, the present study adds to current existing knowledge. However, our study has some limitations. The  primary one is that the study lacked multivariate  regression analysis to investigate the interaction of  other independent variables with mutant alleles of  studied  eNOS  gene variants. The analysis is being  done including another widely studied T-786C polymorphism in promoter region of  eNOS  to be published  later. The sample size of the study was small to reach  the high statistical power. Also, the study did not  evaluate   $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{x}}$   levels among patients and controls to  correlate with G894T and 4ab polymorphism and to  explore the functional impact of these  eNOS  variants.  The patients were mainly elderly, representing only a  particular age group of the population. Apart from the  above mentioned  eNOS  variants, it is possible that  multiple rare  eNOS  mutations might influence endothelial function measures.  

# CONCLUSION  

The case-control association studies are powerful  approaches to study the genetic basis of complex disorders like stroke, as they do not require family-based  collections which is a challenging task considering the  late-onset of diseases. The present study shows an  impact of  eNOS  G894T polymorphism on ischemic  stroke predisposition in North Indian population.  However, no influence of intronic 4ab polymorphism  was observed on ischemic stroke outcome. Furthermore,  studies with large sample size are required to establish  an effective association of these variants with ischemic  stroke and these genetic effects in ischemic stroke  pathogen es is are needed to be studied in conjunction  with functional effect of these variants.
