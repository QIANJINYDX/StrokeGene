Introduction:  Previous studies have reported the involvement of nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in ﬂ ammasome in the in ﬂ ammatory activation and path o physiology of Ischemic Stroke (IS). Variations in genes encoding the constituent proteins of NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome can alter the risk of IS. Objective:  We investigated the role of the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome in the pathogen es is of IS by establishing associations between combined polymorphisms of caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 8 ( CARD8 ) rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs10754558 and the susceptibility to IS in a Chinese population.  Methods:  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in  CARD8  rs2043211 and  NLRP3  rs10754558 were analyzed using  Taq Man SNP genotyping assays in patients with IS   $(n{=}234)$  and healthy controls   $(n{=}115)$  ). Logistic regression analysis was carried out to evaluate potential interactions between  CARD8  and  NLRP3 .  Results:  Compared with healthy controls, there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in the minor allele frequency (MAF) and the genotype frequency of  NLRP3  rs10754558 or  CARD8  rs2043211 in patients with I  $\updelta(P{>}0.05)$  .  After strati ﬁ cation by gender, there was an increased risk for IS in men carrying heterozygous  CARD8  rs2043211 when a co-dominant genetic model was applied (  $P{=}0.021$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}3.83[1.22\!-\!12.03],$  ). Logistic regression analysis indicated that men carrying both  CARD8  rs2043211 AT and  NLRP3  rs10754558 CG had a signi ﬁ cantly higher risk of IS  $(P{=}0.046,$  , OR=7.116[1.033  49.044]). Conclusions:  Nucleotide variations in the genes encoding NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome proteins may be important to  $\mathrm{IS},$   and men carrying  CARD8  rs2043211 and  NLRP3 rs10754558, both heterozygous, confer a higher risk of IS.

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke is a common medical emergency with high mortality. There are two types of stroke, namely, hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke (IS), and  $85{-}90\%$   of stroke cases are ischemic. Studies have con ﬁ rmed that the nucleotidebinding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in ﬂ ammasome may be involved in activating the in ﬂ ammation and path o physiology of atherosclerosis as well as in mediating in ﬂ ammatory injury during cerebral ischemia.  

The NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome is composed of three proteins, namely, NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and pro-caspase-1. NLRP3 contains three conserved domains known as PYD, LRR, and NOD. Upon activation of the LRR domain by stimuli, such as bacterial toxins, cholesterol, and uric acid crystals, etc., NLRP3 oli gomer ize s via self-interaction through its NOD domain, which causes it to bind to ASC via its PYD domain. Subsequently, ASC recruits pro-caspase-1 to form in ﬂ ammasome via the CARD domain, thereby resulting in the autocatalytic cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into active caspase-1. Caspase-1, in turn, processes pro-IL $1\upbeta$   into active mature  $\mathrm{{IL}{-}18.}$  , which is secreted into the extracellular space. IL $\cdot1\upbeta$   is a cytokine with essential roles in a variety of biological processes, including in ﬂ ammation and autoimmune processes, by triggering the adaptive immune response. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that  $\operatorname{IL}–1\upbeta$   plays a signi ﬁ cant role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and IS.  

Caspase recruitment domain family member 8(CARD8) is an adaptor molecule that negatively regulates the NFk B signaling pathway and apoptosis.   It contains two CARD domains and one FIIND domain. According to  Sayaka  et al 3 , this protein also negatively regulates the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome by binding to the NOD domain of NLRP3 via its FIIND domain, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 oli gomer iz ation. NLRP3 may remain in an inactive state until the cells encounter stimuli exceeds a certain threshold, in which case NLRP3 interacts with ASC instead of CARD8. On the basis of these  ﬁ ndings,  Agostini  et al   4   proposed that CARD8 is a component of the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome.  

Changes in the genes/proteins of NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome components can modulate the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome-mediated in ﬂ ammatory response, thereby affecting the incidence and outcome of IS.   There are few studies addressing how defects in NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome genes contribute to the pathogen es is of IS, and there are no studies addressing the critical interactions between NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome genes.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. Research subjects  

The patients enrolled in this study included a cohort of 234 unrelated Chinese men and women who had suffered IS. The patients were hospitalized and treated in the Neurology Department, Nanxishan Hospital of Guangxi of China, from 2015 to 2017. For comparison, 115 healthy controls, who visited the Medical Examination Center at the same hospital from 2015 to 2017, were also enrolled.  

# 2.2. Risk factor assessment  

Demographic characteristics and vascular risk factors, including a history of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dys lipid emi a, and/or ischemic heart disease, were collected from the patients ’  medical records for the IS cohort and from a structured questionnaire for the control cohort. In this study, hypertension was de ﬁ ned as systolic  $\mathrm{BP}\,\geq\,140~\mathrm{mmHg}$   or diastolic   $\mathrm{BP}\,\geq\,90~\mathrm{mmHg}$  . Diabetes was de ﬁ ned as an elevated fasting plasma glucose level  $({\geq}126~\mathrm{mg/GL})$  ). Dys lipid emi a was de ﬁ ned by a diagnosis of the disease. Ischemic heart disease was de ﬁ ned as a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary intervention or bypass surgery.  

# 2.3. Inclusion criteria  

Patients were enrolled in the study if they were between the ages of 18 and 85 years and met the following criteria: (a) diagnosis of stroke as de ﬁ ned by WHO (rapidly developing clinical symptoms and/or signs of focal cerebral dysfunction with no other apparent cause and symptoms lasting for more than  $24\,\mathrm{h}$  ); (b) having had one of 2 subtypes of IS, athero sclerotic thrombosis (AT) or small artery disease (SAD), based on the modi ﬁ ed TOAST etiology classi ﬁ cation crite-
 $\mathrm{\pi a^{6}}$  ; (c) the results of non contrast computed tom or graph y

 (NCCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head indicating IS; (d) Chinese ethnicity (participants and their ancestors coming from mainland China for at least 2 generations); and (e) no history of trauma, brain tumor/metastases, known single-gene stroke disorder, central nervous system vasculitis, intra cerebral hemorrhage, sub ara ch noid hemor- rhage, transient ischemic attack, or autoimmune/in ﬂ amma- tion-related disorders. The controls met all the inclusion criteria, except that they were stroke-free as determined by the Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-free Status (QVSS).  

# 2.4. Genotyping  

Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA-anti coagulated blood specimens using a standard method. The PCR primers ( Table 1 ) were designed according to the gene sequences in GenBank ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ ).  

Genotyping was performed in a Light Cycle r 480 II System (Rotkreuz, Switzerland) using the  Taq Man SNP Genotyping Kit (B639274_B639275_B639276, BBI).The PCR mixture contained   $1\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of template DNA,   $5~{\upmu\mathrm{L}}$   of   $\mathrm{qPCR}$  Master Mix,   $0.25~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   each of upstream and downstream

primers  $(10~\upmu\mathrm{M})$ , $0.2~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  each of speciﬁc probes  $(10~\upmu\mathrm{M})$ ,and   $3.1~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of deionized water. For each 96-well PCR plate, we also included two blank controls. The PCR reaction was carried out at   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $4\mathrm{{min},}$  , followed by 40 cycles at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 7 s,  $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $40\ s,$   and  $72\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 1s. Light Cycle r 480 Software 1.5 was used to analyze the results. Ten percent of the samples were directly sequenced to con ﬁ rm the genotyping results.  

# 2.5. Statistical Analysis  

EpiData3.1 Software was used to compile the data and to verify its consistency. SPSS 20.0 Software was used to analyze the data. Student ’ s    $t$  -test and chi-squared test were conducted to identify signi ﬁ cant differences. Adjusted logistic regression models were established to evaluate the potential multiplicative interactions between CARD8  rs2043211 and  NLRP3  rs10754558. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with a  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval (CI). The covariates in the logistic regression models were the potential risk factors for IS. The covariates included gender, ethnicity, smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease; and the HDL-C level. The frequencies of the target SNPs in healthy controls satis ﬁ ed the Hardy  Weinberg equilibrium as determined by Haploview 4.2 Software.  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. Participant characterization  

In controls, the target SNPs satis ﬁ ed the Hardy  Weinberg equilibrium (rs10754558:  $x^{2}{=}1.98,$  ,  ${\it P}{=}0.16;$  ; rs2043211:  $x^{2}{=}0.27,$  ,  $\it{P=0.60}$  ). The demographic features and vascular risk factors of 234 patients and 115 controls were analyzed, and the results are summarized in  Table 2 . The participants were matched by age. Except for HDL-C, there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in the levels of CHO, TG or LDL-C in patients with IS compared to controls. However, there were signi ﬁ - cant differences in gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease between the groups. These factors, including HDL-C levels, were taken as the adjustment factors in the subsequent logistic regression analysis.  

# 3.2. Gene  environment interactions  

The interactions between genes and the environment were analyzed using an adjusted logistic regression model. The results indicated that there was evidence of interactions between the target SNPs (rs10754558, rs2043211) and smoking, hypertension, and HDL-C levels. The interaction between the target SNPs and smoking  $(P{<}0.001)$   and hypertension  $(P{<}0.001)$   increased the risk of IS signi ﬁ cantly, In addition, we also noted a strong

# 3.3. MAF/genotype frequency distribution and IS risk  

There were no differences in the frequency distribution of genotypes and the minor alleles of rs10754558 or rs2043211 between the groups, even after multivariate logistic regression analysis, which adjusted for gender, smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and HDL-C level.  

After strati ﬁ cation by gender ( Table 4 ), we did not observe a signi ﬁ cant difference in the MAF distributions of the target SNPs. Compared with the controls, there was an increased risk for IS in men carrying heterozygous CARD8  rs2043211 when a co-dominant genetic model was applied  $P{=}0.021$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}{=}3.83$  ,  $95\%C I{=}1.22{-}12.03\$  ). After strati ﬁ cation by gender, we did not observe a signi ﬁ cant correlation between  NLRP3  rs10754558 and the risk of IS.  

# 3.4. Gene  Gene interactions  

As shown in  Table 5 , there was evidence of interactions between  CARD8  rs2043211 and  NLRP3  rs10754558. Our logistic regression model suggested that the frequency of the genotype combination  CARD8 / NLRP3  AT/CG differed signi ﬁ cantly, and that it strongly correlated with an increased risk of IS   $\scriptstyle{\mathit{P}}=0.019,$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.74$  ,   $95\%C!\!=\!1.18\!-\!6.38)$  ). There was no correlation between IS and other  CARD8 / NLRP3  genotype combinations.  

After strati ﬁ cation by gender ( Table 6 ), the frequency of the genotype combination  CARD8/NLRP3  AT/CG was higher in men with IS than in controls, and it strongly correlated with an increased risk of IS (  $P{=}0.046,$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}{=}7.116,$   $95\%C I{=}1.033{-}49.044)$  ). Thus it can be seen, When interaction analysis was done for  NLRP3  CG and  CARD8  AT, the odds ratio for susceptibility to IS in men was signi ﬁ - cantly higher than for the single  CARD8  AT gene  $(P{=}0.021$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}{=}3.83.$  ). There was no correlation between the risk of IS and  CARD8  rs2043211/ NLRP3  rs10754558 genotype combinations in women, suggesting that these polymorphisms only increase the risk for IS in men.  

# 4. Discussion  

NLRP3 rs10754558 and rs35829419 (  $(\mathrm{c}.2113\mathrm{C}\!>\!\mathrm{A},$  Q705K) are the two polymorphisms extensively studied in  NLRP3 , and both minor alleles are regarded as  ‘ gain-offunction ’  alleles. The polymorphism rs10754558, which is located in the 3 ’ UTR of  NLRP3 , and the minor allele G was reported to cause conformation al change in the NLRP3  mRNA and to increase its stability, thereby upregulating the  NLRP3  expression level.   In contrast, CARD8  rs2043211   $(\mathrm{c.30T\!>\!A,}$   p.C10X) introduces a stop codon in the    $C A R D8\ \mathrm{mRNA},$   which results in the expression of a truncated protein unable to suppress NF $\cdot\mathsf{\kappa B}$   signaling. As a result, pro-IL $\cdot1\upbeta,$  , a substrate for the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome, is expressed constitutive ly.  

In agreement with previous investigations   into the association between NLRP3 rs35829419 or CARD8 rs2043211 and susceptibility to in ﬂ ammatory diseases, we failed to identify a correlation between  CARD8  rs2043211 or  NLRP3  rs10754558 and IS susceptibility in a Chinese Han population. However, after strati ﬁ cation by gender, we found that men carrying heterozygous CARD8 rs2043211 were at a higher risk for IS than controls when a co-dominant genetic model was applied, but, there was no signi ﬁ cant correlation between  NLRP3  rs10754558 and the risk of IS. The current study does not support the  ﬁ ndings of studies by Bai et al   13   and Zhu et al,   which are currently the only studies that have evaluated the association between IS susceptibility and variations in the genes encoding the constituent proteins of the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome.  Bai  et al   13   found that the minor allele T of CARD8  rs2043211 strongly correlated with a reduced risk of IS in a recessive model, and the correlation was stronger for women.  Zhu  et al   14   reported that the G allele of NLRP3  rs10754558 was associated with increased IS risk in a Chinese population. Our study may not be directly comparable to these two studies for three reasons. First, we only included the atherosclerosis-related AT and SAD subtypes in our study, whereas Zhu and Bai ’ s studies analyzed all subtypes of IS, including the subtypes for cardio embolisms, undetermined and other etiologies. Second, and perhaps more importantly, our study ’ s small sample size is a substantial difference that may preclude direct

comparison with the other studies. Third, the studies by Zhu and Bai only analyzed the association between a single gene polymorphism and susceptibility to IS, whereas our study explored whether susceptibility to IS is in ﬂ uenced by combined polymorphisms in the genes that encode the in ﬂ ammasome components.  

We reviewed previously published studies   that analyzed the association between single SNP in genes among the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome and susceptibility to different in ﬂ ammatory diseases. These studies reported con ﬂ icting results, which may possibly be explained by the presence of SNPs in other components of the in ﬂ ammasome complex.   Some have reported that the combined polymorphisms in  CARD8  rs2043211 and  NLRP3  rs35829419 may alter the susceptibility to Crohn ’ s disease,   abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA),   and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ,   Here, we contend that it would be biased to ignore the in ﬂ uence of combined polymorphisms in genes encoding the in ﬂ ammasome components on the susceptibility to diseases, especially to those diseases with multiple genes control such as stroke, and for the research on multi protein complex, such as the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome, it could hardly re ﬂ ect the exact genetic effect on the pathogenesis of diseases. Therefore, we narrowed our research focus to gene  gene interactions between CARD8 rs2043211 and  NLRP3  10754558 in a Chinese Han population with established IS. Then, we found that there was a signi ﬁ cantly increased risk for IS in men carrying both CARD8 rs2043211 AT and NLRP3 rs10754558 CG  $(P{=}0.046,$  , OR  $\mathord{=}7.116$  ,  Table 6 ). We also observed a synergistic effect when the  NLRP3  10754558 CG genotype inter- acts with the  CARD8  rs2043211 AT genotype, which was the hypothesis we posited at the beginning of this study. Meanwhile, due to the high sensitivity of the Logistic regression multiplication interaction model, the OR value was further increased. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the  ﬁ rst study to investigate the association between combined  CARD8  rs2043211 and  NLRP3  rs10754558 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to IS.  

Similar to IS, the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome also contributes to the development of AAA.   Roberts et   $a l^{23}$    reported that CARD8  rs2043211/ NLRP3  rs35829419 A,T/C,C was associated with decreased AAA risk. This  ﬁ nding is inconsistent with a previous study,   in which both the genotype combinations  CARD8  rs2043211/ NLRP3  rs35829419 A,T/C,C and A,A/C,A correlated with a decreased risk of in ﬂ ammatory bowel disease. Thus, the minor allele A of NLRP3 rs35829419 has protective effects in the presence of the major allele of homozygous  CARD8  rs2043211. Similarly, the minor allele T of  CARD8  rs2043211 has protective effects in the presence of the major allele of homozygous  NLRP3 rs35829419. There are no protective effects when the minor allele is present in both markers.  

Unlike the aforementioned studies, which assessed all genotype combinations of CARD8 C10X and NLRP3 Q705K, Schoultz  et al   22   and  Kastbom  et al   24 ,   further divided research subjects into subgroups based on the presence (C10X/  $\mathsf{Q705K^{-/-}})$  ) or absence   $(\mathrm{C10X/Q705K^{+/+}})$   of at least one allele variation in both genes. In 2008,  Kastbom  et al   24   reported that RA patients carrying  $C10X/Q705\mathrm{K}^{-/-}$    have higher disease activity and are more likely to receive TNF-blocking therapy. Furthermore, In 2015,  Kastbom  et al   25   con ﬁ rmed that RA patients with more than one variant allele in both genes have an increased risk of stroke/TIA compared to patients without variant alleles present in both polymorphisms, and not to myocardial infarction (MI)/angina pectoris. In addition, the risk estimates are consistently higher among female patients. The signi ﬁ cance of this SNP combination was further demonstrated in a study on CD patients,   in which the combined genotype C10X/Q705K  /  strongly correlated with increased risk of developing CD among males.  

Our logistic regression models indicated that the genotypic combination  CARD8  rs2043211/ NLRP3  rs10754558 AT/CG was strongly associated with a higher risk of IS among males. This genetic relationship can be easily explained by the biological roles of  NLRP3  and  CARD8  described in previous studies. The T allele of rs2043211 introduces a premature stop codon in the  CARD8  mRNA, which was subsequently translated into a truncated CARD8 protein that is unable to suppress   $\mathrm{NF}–\kappa\mathrm{B}$   signaling, resulting in constitutive pro-IL $1\upbeta$   expression. However, in the absence of the gain-of-function minor allele of  NLRP3 , accumulated pro-IL-  $\cdot1\upbeta$   cannot be translated into excess mature   $\mathrm{{IL-18}}$  . Furthermore, it can be seen that the genetic risk to IS in our study population was consistently higher among men. This may partly be explained by a recent study, which demonstrated that estrogen and progesterone can regulate the protein level of ASC and NLRP3 and suppress the expression of in ﬂ ammasome components in a transient focal rat ischemic model.   There- fore, estrogen may modulate the pro-in ﬂ ammatory response in females and may be important for women to avoid suffering from stroke. Finally, as the proportions of  CARD8 rs2043211/ NLRP3  $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}10754558^{+/-}$  ( AA/CG,AA/GG) and CARD8  rs2043211/ NLRP3  rs10754558  /+ ( AT/CC,TT/CC) were similar in patients and controls in our study, it appears that a variant allele must be present at both loci to increase the risk of IS. Here, we propose a genetic model in which men carrying  CARD8  rs2043211/ NLRP3  rs10754558 AT/CG have a higher risk of IS in a Chinese Han population.  

However, outcomes across various studies were not uniform regarding the combined effect of the SNPs in  NLRP3 and  CARD8 . Several studies   did not observe any in ﬂ uence of the interactions between  NLRP3  Q705K and  CARD8 C10X on RA susceptibility. We found that none of the combined genotypes of  CARD8  rs2043211/ NLRP3  rs10754 558 TT/GG and TT/CG was associated with the sus ce pti bility to IS. These con ﬂ icting outcomes may be explained by the fact that the  CARD8  gene revealed a series of mRNA isoforms (T48, T54, T47, T51, and T60) that may have an effect on the functional consequences of the C10X (rs2043211),   and that patients with  CARD8  rs2043211 TT continue to express a slightly smaller but fully functional isoform as a result of transcription of the  CARD8  isoform T47.   26 ,   The  CARD8  gene is capable of generating several isoforms of CARD8 that result from different N-terminal transcription start sites. The predominant CARD8 isoform expressed in normal cells is a 48kDa isoform (T48).   T48 interacts with NLRP3 via its FIIND domain and negatively regulates the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome. The SNP rs2043211 of  CARD8  results in a Cys  $,>$  Stop located at codon 10(C10X) in T48, which generates a severely truncated protein, and the C10X polymorphism would effectively result in the loss of CARD8 expression. The T60 isoform of CARD8 also binds to NLRP3, inhibiting its activity. Mutated T60 isoforms of CARD8 cannot down regulate the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome because mutated T60 could bind with unmutated T60 or T48 isoforms of CARD8 to form oligomers, impeding their ability to bind to NLRP3.   Bagnall and colleagues 26   found that genotype AA expresses the T48 isoform and genotype TT expresses the T47 isoform. There may be either some degree of redundancy in the functional pathways or partial rescue of the CARD8 function via alternative translation or splicing, which leads to a nearly full-length protein. Because transcription of the  CARD8  T47 isoform starts downstream of the C10X mutation 26 , patients homozygous for this stop codon, which apparently affects the 48kDa major isoform of CARD8, but retain an  ${\sim}48\mathrm{Da}$   immuno reactive protein. So, the presence of the T47 isoform in patients with CARD8  rs2043211 TT may express functional CARD8.   Various isoforms of CARD8 have unclear functional roles, as does the possible role of the C10X polymorphism. Future studies in this area may uncover more information. Especially, mRNA levels for T47 should be measured in selected cohorts to better understand the status of CARD8 in the Han Chinese and other populations to determine whether the abundance of this isoform varies among ethnicities.  

# 5. Conclusions  

In the current study, we found that genetic variability within the genes encoding the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome components NLRP3 and CARD8 may be important to the pathophysiology of IS, and the men carrying  CARD8  rs2043211 and  NLRP3  10754558, both heterozygous, are susceptible to IS. Our results propose a genetic model in which men carrying  CARD8  rs2043211/ NLRP3  rs10754558 AT/CG have a higher risk of IS in a Chinese Han population. This model may provide new insights on identifying high-risk populations that may be responsive to  $\mathrm{{IL-1}}\upbeta$  -targeted therapy.  

Finally, we understand that our small sample size is a limitation of this study. Thus, our team considers the research presented in this manuscript to be preliminary. We plan to follow up our research by repeating the study with a larger sample size.
