Purpose:  Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) both  catalyze the metabolism of epoxy ei cos at rien oic acids (EETs), lipid signaling molecules that  are protective against ischemic brain injury owing to their participation in the regulation of  vascular tone and cerebral blood flow. In addition, mEH metabolizes polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons, one of the causative factors of at hero sclerotic lesion development. In this  study, we aimed to investigate the association of enzyme activity-modifying missense single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the sEH gene ( EPHX2 ) and mEH gene ( EPHX1 ) and  ischemic stroke risk in a Turkish population.  

Patients and Methods:  Genomic DNA of patients with large artery at hero sclerotic  ischemic stroke   $(\mathsf{n}\!\!=\!\!237)$  ) and controls   $\mathrm{(n{=}120)}$  ) was isolated from blood samples, and geno­ types for Tyr113His (rs1051740) and His139Arg (rs2234922) SNPs of  EPHX1  and  Arg287Gln (rs751141) SNP of  EPHX2  were attained by the PCR/RFLP method.  

Results:  Minor allele frequency and genotype distributions for Arg287Gln, Tyr113His and  His139Arg SNPs did not differ significantly between stroke patients and controls. However,  hypertension- and diabetes-associated ischemic stroke risk was decreased by  EPHX1  and  increased by  EPHX2  variants in stratification analyses.  

Conclusion:  This study has shown for the first time that the polymorphic alleles of  EPHX1  were unlikely to be associated with large artery at hero sclerotic ischemic stroke susceptibility;  however, protective effects were evident within subgroups of hypertension and diabetes. In  addition,  EPHX2  Arg287Gln polymorphism, which has been studied for the first time in  a Turkish population, was not significantly related to ischemic stroke, but increased the  stroke risk in subgroup analysis.

# Introduction  

Stroke, the second leading cause of death after ischemic heart disease worldwide, is  characterized by the loss of one or more functions of the body owing to inadequate  blood supply to the brain. Ischemic stroke is the most common type, accounting for  more than  $80\%$   of all cases, and results from the obstruction of a blood vessel that  supplies blood to the brain. If the obstruction is due to a blood clot that forms on  an at hero sclerotic plaque within a blood vessel in the brain, this subtype is called an  a the roth rom bot ic ischemic stroke. The mechanisms under­ lying ischemic stroke have not been completely  explained. ,  

Epoxy ei cos at rien oic acids (EETs) are signaling mole­ cules derived from the 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty  acid arachidonic acid. EETs exhibit a wide array of poten­ tially beneficial actions in stroke, including va so dilation,  neuro protection and promotion of ang io genesis, and sup­ pression of platelet aggregation, oxidative stress and post-ischemic inflammation. Like other epoxides, EETs are  metabolized to their supposedly less active form, dihy­ d roxy ei cos at rien oic acids (DHETs), by epoxide hydrolase  enzymes.  

There are two main epoxide hydrolases: microsomal  and soluble. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH,  EPHX1 , EC 3.3.2.9) is a critical bio transformation enzyme  that catalyzes the metabolism of various xenobiotic epox­ ide substrates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  (PAHs), including carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds  in tobacco smoke, to more polar diol metabolites. These  mutagens stimulate the formation of DNA adducts, which,  apart from carcinogen es is, lead to genetic alterations in  blood vessels. Animal studies have shown that tobacco  smoke mutagens such as PAHs and heterocyclic amines  directly increase the development of at hero sclerotic  lesions. Thus, activity of mEH may alter the a the rogen ic  PAH levels and the risk of ischemic stroke. Moreover,  mEH also plays a role in EET metabolism. Although  sEH mediates the bulk of EET metabolism, a significant  contribution of mEH was observed in mouse brain, point­ ing to a novel role of this enzyme in the regulation of  physiological processes. Two of the missense single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  EPHX1  gene  result in critical amino acid substitutions. rs  $\mathrm{1051740T{>}C}$    SNP (Tyr113His) is located in exon 3 of the gene and the  polymorphic allele changes the codon from that of tyrosine  to histidine at the 113th position. The presence of  a histidine residue instead of a tyrosine leads to a   $39\%$    reduction in enzyme activity. The other missense SNP   $(\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}2234922\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G})$  ) is located in exon 4 and causes an  amino acid change from histidine to arginine at the 139th  position (His139Arg). It has been shown that His139Arg  results in a   $25\%$   increase in enzyme activity. Association  studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms in the  EPHX1  gene may be important risk factors for suscept­ 9–12  ibility to various cancers; however,  EPHX1  genetic  polymorphisms have not been investigated in relation to  ischemic stroke before.  

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH, EC 3.3.2.10) is the  major enzyme that plays a role in the conversion of  , EETs to diol metabolites. sEH inhibitors demon­ strated protection against cardiovascular and ischemic  brain damage in animal models. A missense SNP in  exon 8 of the gene coding for sEH ( EPHX2 )   $\mathrm{(rs751141G{>}A)}$  ) causes an amino acid substitution from  Arg to Gln at position 287 of the enzyme, which leads  to a significant reduction in sEH activity   $(25{-}58\%$   of  that of the wild-type enzyme) in vitro. sEH  Arg287Gln variant was observed to have a protective  effect against ischemic neuronal injury. This finding  overlaps with the proposed effect of sEH activity on  EET bio availability. , There are several previous stu­ dies in other populations on the relationship between  EPHX2  and cardiovascular disease, including ischemic  20–25  stroke risk; however, this relationship has not been  investigated before in a Turkish population.  

It is well established that the frequencies of poly­ morphic alleles vary among populations with different  ethnicities. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this  study for the first time analyzed the association between  Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms of  EPHX1  on  ischemic stroke risk. Moreover, the association of  Arg287Gln polymorphism of  EPHX2  with ischemic stroke  risk was sought for the first time in a Turkish population.  

# Materials and Methods Subjects  

Blood samples of 237 large artery at hero sclerotic ischemic  stroke patients (138 males and 99 females) and 120 symp­ tom-free controls (56 males and 64 females), who were  unrelated, Caucasian people, were collected from Central  Anatolia, Turkey, with the collaboration of Gülhane  Medical Academy, Department of Neurology, Ankara,  Turkey. All participating individuals were informed about  the study and signed informed consent forms were  obtained. This study was approved by the Ethical  Committee of Gülhane Medical Academy and carried out  according to the principles of the 1964 Declaration of  Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical  standards. All laboratory studies were performed blinded  to the medical conditions of the subjects.  

The details of inclusion and exclusion criteria were as  , described before. In brief, a the roth rom bot ic ischemic  stroke patients were recruited to this study. The initial  diagnosis of cerebral infarction was made on the basis of  a neurological examination and brain computed tomography  (CT) scan, and then a trans thoracic echo car dio graphic  examination, Holter study and trans cranial Doppler emboli  detection procedure were carried out to rule out  embolic sources. The inclusion criterion for patients was  having had an anterior circulation stroke. The “large-vessel  disease” group described by the Trial of ORG 10172 in  Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST), in addition to the “total  anterior” and “partial anterior circulation infarcts” groups  described by the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project  (OCSP), were selected as cases.  

The exclusion criteria included having other major ill­ nesses, including autoimmune diseases, coa gulo p athies,  neoplasms, renal or hepatic failure, any known embolic  source (aortic arch, cardiac or carotid), a family history of  hematological, autoimmune or chronic inflammatory dis­ eases, and a history of myocardial infarction within 3  weeks, or of transient ischemic attack or stroke at any  time.  

The control subjects were selected randomly from the  neurology outpatient clinics from individuals who had not  had a stroke or transient ischemic attack at any time, or  carotid stenosis (lumen narrowing)   ${>}50\%$   or ulcerated  carotid plaque. All exclusion criteria were exactly applied  to the controls.  

Both cases and controls gave a detailed history of  conventional vascular risk factors and conditions.  Moreover, they underwent routine laboratory tests, includ­ ing complete blood count, leukocyte differential count and  erythrocyte sedimentation rate; routine biochemistry tests,  including fasting glucose, lipid profile (triglycerides, total  cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL]-cholesterol and  high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol), creatinine,  sodium, potassium, bilirubin, liver function tests, routine  urine tests and rheum a to logical screening tests; and elec­ tro cardiogram and chest X-ray.  

# Genotype Determination  

A manual salting-out DNA isolation protocol, with minor  modifications, was used to isolate DNA from whole blood  samples of the subjects. In brief,   $750~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of TKM buffer  (  $10~\mathrm{mM}$   Trizma buffer  $\mathrm{pH}\ 7.6$  , containing   $10~\mathrm{{mM}~K C l,}$   2  mM EDTA and 4 mM   $\mathrm{{MgCl}}_{2}$  ) was added to   $750~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of  total blood. Then,  $20~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of Triton X-100 was added to the  tube and the solution was mixed with several inversions to  lyse the cells. Cent ri fuga tion was performed at   $1000\times g$    at  room temperature   $(25^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$   using a Sigma 1–15 benchtop  micro centrifuge (Sigma, Osterode am Harz, Germany) for   $10\ \mathrm{min}$  . Two phases were observed after the centrifuga­ tion; the pellet containing the DNA was saved and two  more washing steps with TKM buffer were performed.  The final pellet was re suspended in   $200~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of TKM buffer  and then   $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of   $10\%$   sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was  added. The suspension was thoroughly mixed and incu­ bated at   $58^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10~\mathrm{min}$  . Next,   $75~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of cold saturated  NaCl was added, which resulted in the precipitation of  proteins.  Then,  cent ri fuga tion  was  performed  at   $14{,}000\times g$    for   $10\ \mathrm{min}$   at  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The DNA-containing super­ natant was transferred into a clean tube and   $2\times$   volume  ice-cold absolute ethanol was added to precipitate the  DNA. The tube was inverted several times, kept at   $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for at least   $30~\mathrm{\min}$  , and then centrifuged at   $10{,}000{\times}g$    for   $10\,\mathrm{\min}$   at   $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The super nat ant was dis­ carded, and the pellet containing DNA was dried until the  ethanol was completely removed, and dissolved in   $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  of TE buffer,  $\mathrm{pH}\ 8.0$  . The tube was then incubated at  $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for at least   $2\textup{h}$  .  

Genotyping for all polymorphisms was carried out using  the polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length  polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Determination of gen­ otypes for Tyr113His (  $\mathrm{trs}1051740\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C})$  ) polymorphism of  EPHX1  included initial amplification of a 200-bp region in  exon 3 of the gene. The PCR mixture contained   $1\times$   ampli­ fication buffer,   $1.25~\mathrm{{mM}~M g C l_{2}}$  ,  $200\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$   dNTP mixture, 40  pmol of each primer,   $2.5\,\mathrm{~U~}$   Taq DNA polymerase and  approximately   $200\,\mathrm{\Deltang}$  DNA template. The sequences of  the forward and reverse primers were   $5^{\prime}$  - GGGGTCC  TG A AT TTT GC T CC $.3^{\prime}$    and   $5^{\prime}$  -CA AT CT TAG TC TT GA  AGTGACGGT-3ʹ, respectively. The primers were checked  to ensure binding to the  EPHX1  gene exon 3 region using  the Primer-BLAST web tool. PCR was carried out using  a Techne TC-4000 thermal cycler (Techne, Duxford,  Cambridge, UK) with the following thermal cycling condi­ tions: initial de natura tion at   $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for   $5\;\mathrm{min}$  , followed by 35  cycles of de natura tion at   $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for 1 min, annealing at   $55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for   $1\ \mathrm{min}$   and extension at   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\ \mathrm{min}$  . Three units of   $P s y I\left(T t h I I I\right)$   (MBI Fermentas, USA) end on ucl ease restric­ tion enzyme was used to digest the 200-bp PCR products  and results were analyzed on   $2.5\%$   agarose gel ( Figure 1 ).  A single band of 200 bp represents the banding pattern of the  wild-type homozygous genotype (TT or   $113\mathrm{{Tyr}}/113\mathrm{{Tyr}})$  ,  while two bands of 177 and 23 bp represent the homozygous  polymorphic genotype (CC or 113His/113His). The banding  pattern of the heterozygous genotype (TC or 113Tyr/113His)  is three bands, at 200, 177 and 23 bp.

Figure 1  Agarose gel image showing the representative banding patterns for determining genotypes for  EPHX1  Tyr113His (rs1051740T>C) polymorphism. A   $_{200-{\tt b p}}$  fragment in   $E P H X I$    gene exon 3 was amplified with PCR and then the PCR product was subjected to restriction end on ucl ease digestion with  PsyI  ( Tth111 ). Digestion  products were resolved by  $2.5\%$   agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining and the DNA bands were visualized by UV illumination. The lane labeled with  L was loaded with a DNA ladder (1000 to 50 bp). Lanes 2 and 4 contain a band at  $200\,{\sf b p}$  , which represents the banding pattern of the wild-type homozygous genotype (TT  or 113Tyr/113Tyr). Lane 3 contains two bands at 177 and  ${23}\,{\mathsf{b p}}$  , showing the banding pattern of the homozygous polymorphic genotype (CC or   $\mid\!\mid\!3\!\mid\!\mathsf{H i s}/\!\mid\!\mid\!3\!\mid\!\mathsf{H i s},$  ). Lanes 1 and  5 show the banding pattern of the heterozygous genotype (TC or 113Tyr/113His), which is three bands, at 200, 177, and 23 bp, as expected.  

The PCR fragments for His139Arg (  $\mathrm{trs}2234922\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G})$  )  polymorphism on  EPHX1  were obtained using the following  primer pair: forward  $5^{\prime}$  -A CAT CC ACT T CAT CCA CGT-  $3^{\prime}$   and  reverse   $5^{\prime}–$   AT GCC T CT GAGA A GCC AT-3ʹ. The primers  were checked to ensure binding to the  EPHX1  gene exon 4  region using the Primer-BLAST web tool. PCR was per­ formed as described for Tyr113His polymorphism of the same  gene. The expected PCR product length was 210 bp.  Restriction end on ucl ease digestion with 10-unit  RsaI  (MBI  Fermentas, USA) was performed for each PCR product with  the correct band length and the results were analyzed on  $2.5\%$  agarose gel ( Figure 2 ). Digestion resulted in a single undi­ gested 210-bp fragment for the homozygous wild-type geno­ type (AA or 139His/139His), and 163 and 47-bp fragments for  the homozygous polymorphic genotype (GG or   $139\mathrm{Arg}/$  139Arg). Three bands indicated that the person was hetero­ zygous for the His139Arg polymorphism (AG or   $139\mathrm{His}/$   $139\mathrm{Arg}$  ).  

To determine the genotypes for the  EPHX2  Arg287Gln  (  $\mathrm{fs}751141\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  ) polymorphism, PCR was carried out using  20 pmol of each of the following primers: forward   $5^{\prime}.$  -  AG GAG GG TG ACT CCA GAC CT $3^{\prime}$    and  reverse   $5^{\prime}$  -  CC TT G GAG CAT GA GCC T TAG-  $3^{\prime}~1\times$   PCR buffer,   $2~\mathrm{mM}$   $\mathrm{{MgCl}}_{2}$  ,   $200~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   dNTPs,   $1.5\,\mathrm{~U~}$   of Taq DNA polymerase 

 (MBI Fermentas, USA) and about  $200\;\mathrm{ng}$   of genomic DNA  in   $50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   total reaction volume. The primers were designed  using the Primer-BLAST web tool. The PCR conditions  were: initial de natura tion at   $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for   $2\;\mathrm{min}$  , followed by 32  cycles of de natura tion at   $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for   $15\mathrm{~s~}$  , annealing at   $55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for  $30~\mathrm{s}$   and extension at   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\;\mathrm{s}.$  , and a final extension  step at   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $3\;\mathrm{{min}}$  . The expected length of PCR products  was 683 bp, containing three or two recognition sites for the  MspI  (MBI Fermentas, USA) restriction enzyme, depending  on the presence of G or A at the SNP site, respectively. Thus,  incubation of the 683-bp PCR product with 4-unit  MspI  resulted in four fragments of 244, 237, 152 and 50 bp for  the G allele, which looked like three bands on   $2.5\%$   agarose  gel electrophoresis because the 244-bp and 237-bp bands  could not be distinguished ( Figure 3 ). On the other hand,  three fragments of 244, 237 and 202-bp length were  obtained for the A allele, which gave two bands on agarose  gel electrophoresis. Digestion products obtained from het­ erozygotes (GA or 287Arg/287Gln) contained 244, 237,  202, 152 and 50-bp fragments; however. the 244-bp and  237-bp bands were not distinguishable when separated on   $2.5\%$   agarose gel and, thus, looked like a darker single band.  

# Statistical Analysis  

The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to test normality  of the distribution of continuous variables (age, total cho­ lesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol).  Differences for continuous data which followed a normal

A 210-bp  fragment in  EPHX1  gene exon 4 was amplified with PCR and then the PCR product was subjected to restriction end on ucl ease digestion with  RsaI . Digestion products were  resolved by  $2.5\%$   agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining and the DNA bands were visualized by UV illumination. The lane labeled with L was loaded with  a DNA ladder (1000 to 50 bp). Lanes 2 and 5 contain a band at 210 bp, which represents the banding pattern of the wild-type homozygous genotype (AA or  ${\sf I39H i s/I39H i s)}$  .  Lane 4 contains two bands, at 164 and 46 bp (the 46-bp band was at the very end of gel, which could not be photographed), showing the banding pattern of the homozygous  polymorphic genotype (GG or  ${\mathsf{I39A r g/I39A r g}})$  . Lanes 1 and 3 show the banding pattern of the heterozygous genotype (AG or 139His/139Arg), which is three bands, at 210,  164 and 46 bp, as expected.

A 683-bp  fragment in   $E P H X2$    gene exon 8 was amplified with PCR and then the PCR product was subjected to restriction end on ucl ease digestion with  MspI . Digestion products were  resolved by  $2.5\%$   agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining and the DNA bands were visualized by UV illumination. The lane labeled with L was loaded with  a DNA ladder (1000 to   ${\sf50~b p}.$  ). Lanes 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 show the banding pattern of the homozygous wild-type genotype (GG or  $287\mathsf{A r g}/287\mathsf{A r g})$  ), which is three bands at  240–236, 150 and 50 bp. Lane 1 contains two bands, at 240–236 and   $200\;{\sf b p}$  , representing the banding pattern of the homozygous polymorphic genotype (AA or  $287G\mathsf{l n}/$  287Gln). Lane 4 shows the banding pattern of the heterozygous genotype (GA or 287Arg/287Gln), which is four bands, at 240–236, 200, 150 and 50 bp, as expected.  

distribution (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-choles­ terol, HDL-cholesterol) between patients and controls  were analyzed using an independent samples   $t\cdot$  -test.  

Continuous data which did not follow a normal distribu­ tion (age) were compared using the Mann–Whitney   $U.$  -test.  Categorical variables such as sex, hypertension, smoking  status, diabetes and obesity were expressed as proportions  and compared using the chi-squared test. Comparisons of  genotype distribution and allele frequencies were assessed  by Pearson’s chi-square statistics with 2 and 1 df, respec­ tively. Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate the   $P$    values when the expected values in any of the cells of  a contingency table were   ${\leq}5$  . Departure from the Hardy–  Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated by the chi-squared  test. Logistic regression analysis with backward selection  was employed to investigate the effects of the vascular risk  factors, age, sex, lipid parameters and genotypes on  ischemic stroke in this Turkish population. Two-tailed  probability values with   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs)  were used in the estimation of odds ratios (ORs).  Calibration of the logistic regression analysis was carried  out with the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit test.  A   $P$    value of less than 0.05 was evaluated as statistically  significant unless otherwise indicated. The cut-off level for  significance was adjusted at   $\alpha/\mathfrak{n}$   using Bonferroni correc­ tion for multiple testing. These statistical analyses were  performed using the SPSS 18.0 software program package  (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). A power calculation to test the  sufficiency of the sample size was carried out using  G Power 3.1 software. A power value  ${>}50\%$   was consid­ ered adequate.  

# Results  

Demographic features, prevalence s of conventional risk  factors and serum lipid levels of the study population are  given in  Table 1 . The age of the study population varied  from 20 to 81 years in the stroke group, and from 39 to 90  years in the control group. There was no significant  differences between patient and control groups in terms  of age. We also evaluated the age range separately in  males and females. In the male population, the age ranged  from 20 to 81 years for stroke patients and from 42 to 87  years in the control group, and there was no significant  difference in the mean age of male stroke patients and  male controls. On the other hand, in the female population,  the age ranged from 31 to 81 years for stroke patients and  from 41 to 90 years in the control group; the mean age was  significantly higher in female stroke patients compared  with female controls   $(P{=}0.014)$  . The conventional risk  factors, namely male gender, hypertension, diabetes,  smoking status and obesity, were found to be significantly  more prevalent in the ischemic stroke group. In addition,  total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were mark­ edly higher, while the HDL-cholesterol level was  significantly lower in ischemic stroke patients compared  with the control group.  

The frequency distributions of Tyr113His ( EPHX1 ),  His139Arg ( EPHX1 ) and Arg287Gln ( EPHX2 ) genotypes  and their corresponding alleles in ischemic stroke patients  and controls are shown in  Tables 2 ,  3  and  4 . There was no  deviation of genotype frequencies from Hardy–Weinberg  equilibrium. We observed that there were no significant  differences between ischemic stroke patients and controls  in terms of genotype distributions and minor allele fre­ quencies for any of the three analyzed genetic polymorph­ isms. The genotype and allele frequencies were also  calculated separately for male and female sub populations  ( Tables 2 – 4 ). The distribution of genotypes and the alleles  for  EPHX2  Arg287Gln polymorphism were significantly  different in the female sub population ( Table 4 ).  

Stratification analysis was carried out to determine  whether the polymorphic alleles modified the conventional  risk factor-related ischemic stroke risk ( Table 5 ). For the  EPHX1  Tyr113His polymorphism, in the homozygote  wild-type genotype (TT) group, the OR for having  ischemic stroke was calculated to be 3.21   $(<\!0.001)$   for  subjects with hypertension compared with subjects with  norm o tension. This value decreased to 2.37   $(<\!0.001)$   when  at least one mutant allele was present (113TC or CC  genotype). Likewise, the ischemic stroke risk of hyperten­ sive subjects relative to nor moten sive subjects was 3.15  when they had the AA genotype for the  EPHX1  His139Arg polymorphism, and this risk decreased to  2.14 in individuals having the AG or GG genotype.  EPHX2  Arg287Gln genetic polymorphism also affected  the hypertension-related ischemic stroke risk. This time,  the OR increased from 2.52 (in wild-type individuals with  the GG genotype) to 4.69 (in individuals having at least  one A allele). When stratification analysis was carried out  with respect to having or not having diabetes, a similar  trend to that observed in the case of hypertension was  observed.  EPHX1  polymorphisms slightly decreased the  diabetes-associated ischemic stroke risk, while  EPHX2  polymorphism increased the risk ( Table 5 ).  

The following parameters were tested by logistic  regression analysis using backward selection to determine  the risk factors for ischemic stroke: age, sex, diabetes,  hypertension, obesity, smoking, concentration of total  cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and trigly­ ceride, as well as the genotypes of  EPHX  Tyr113His,  EPHX1  His139Arg and  EPHX2  Arg287Gln SNPs. The  results  revealed  hypertension  (  $\mathrm{{OR}}{=}3.19$  ,   $95\%$

The Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit test  demonstrated that the calibration of the model was satis­ factory (chi-squar  $\scriptstyle{\geq=6.721}$  , with 8 degrees of freedom,   $P{=}0.567$  ) for logistic regression, and the model predicted   $73.1\%$   of the cases correctly.  

# Discussion  

The prevalence of stroke is about   $3\%$   of the adult popula­ tion in the USA, and it is increasing all over the world as  the aging population increases. In Turkey, the prevalence  is between  $0.9\%$   and  $4.1\%$   among adults aged 45 years and  above. , Moreover, stroke is the most important condi­ tion leading to disability in the elderly. Therefore, it is  important to gather as much information as possible  regarding the genetic determinants of stroke. Ischemic  stroke accounts for around   $80\%$   of all cases; 33  therefore,  in this study we aimed to investigate the possible associa­ tion of  EPHX2  Arg287Gln variation and  EPHX1  Tyr113His and His139Arg variations with ischemic stroke  risk in the Turkish population. The results indicate that  there is no significant association between these genetic  polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk.  

sEH enzyme degrades EETs into DHETs, which have  been considered to be inactive or less active. However,  they were later shown to exert va so dilatory effects on  , coronary arterioles and arteries. In addition, DHETs  have  been  shown  to  display  anti-inflammatory  properties. Therefore, both EETs and their DHET meta­ bolites may be important regulators of the coronary circu­ lation. It was shown in vitro that  EPHX2  Arg287Gln  causes a decrease in sEH activity   $(25{-}58\%$   of that of the  wild-type enzyme). This may explain our finding of no  association between the  EPHX2  287Gln allele and  ischemic stroke risk.  

Moreover, the generation of EETs, via ep oxygenation  of arachidonic acid, is governed by a highly polymorphic  class of enzymes, cytochrome P450s (CYPs). At least 12

human CYP genes have been reported to possess epoxy­ genase activity, including CYP1A families. We have  previously shown that variants of the  CYP1A1  gene were  significantly related to the risk of ischemic stroke, espe­ cially in subgroups. Therefore, the combination of  CYP1A1  and  EPHX2  polymorphisms in a given person is  expected to have a higher impact on governing ischemic  stroke risk or protection.  

It is not surprising, following this information, to see  that there are completely contradictory reports in the lit­ erature regarding the relationship between  EPHX2  Arg287Gln variant and cardiovascular disease risk. The  287Gln allele was observed to have protective effect  against ischemic neuronal injury in a rat model. Similarly, it has been associated with a significantly  lower risk of ischemic stroke in a Chinese population. In contrast, this variant has been observed to be associated  with an increased risk for coronary artery disease in other  studies. , , In addition, it has been associated with  carotid artery calcified plaques in European American  families 41  and with an increased risk of ischemic stroke  (  $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.458$  ,   ${\it P}{=}0.005$  ) in white Europeans. However, no  significant association between the  EPHX2  287Gln allele  and ischemic stroke was detected in a large cohort study in  a Danish population. Likewise, five polymorphisms of  EPHX2 , including 287Gln, did not display a significant  association with ischemic stroke in a large sample of white  and African-American subjects. Significant relationships  were detected with haplotypes; however, the effects of  haplotypes were in opposite directions.  

Another possible explanation for these discrepancies  comes from the work of Ramirez et al, who reported that  no significant relationship was present between the  EPHX2   $\mathrm{{Arg}287\mathrm{{GHz}}}$   genotype and either EET concentrations or sEH  activity, and suggested that an up-regulation of allelic expres­ sion in heterozygotes may have compensated for the less

active allele. It is known that cigarette smoking increases  EPHX2  gene expression, which may compensate for the  enzyme activity reduction caused by the   $\mathrm{Arg}287\mathrm{Gln}$   poly­ morphism. Thus, it is possible to explain the result obtained  in the present study by the presence of more smokers within  the 287Gln (A) allele carriers; smokers accounted for   $25\%$   of  subjects with the GA or AA genotype, and   $20.9\%$   in subjects  with the GG genotype. Therefore, the protection that may have  been conferred by the low-activity   $\mathrm{Gln}287$   (A) allele is can­ celed out by the higher number of smokers in this subgroup,  which probably up regulated the sEH.  

The functions of sEH are related to regulation of the  vascular tone owing to its role in the metabolism of EETs.  Therefore, we carried out stratification analysis based on hav­ ing hypertension, and observed that the presence of 287Gln  genetic variation in  EPHX2  increases the hypertension-related  ischemic stroke risk from 2.52 to 4.69. We also carried out  stratification based on having diabetes, since it has been  reported that  EPHX2  gene transcription is down-regulated  under high glucose conditions. In this analysis,  EPHX2  polymorphism increased diabetes-related ischemic stroke  risk. Ohtoshi et al found that insulin resistance was  significantly increased in type II diabetic patients with the  287Gln allele. The complex interplay between xe no biotic s  such as cigarette smoke-associated chemicals, gene induction  and physiological states such as diabetes could explain these  outcomes.  

The functions of mEH may have potentially contrasting  effects on ischemic stroke risk. This enzyme plays a role in  the metabolism of both EETs 7  and PAHs. Its ability to convert  PAHs into less reactive species makes mEH a protector  against atherosclerosis, which is a significant risk factor lead­ ing to ischemic stroke. In this study, two functional SNPs,  Tyr113His and His139Arg, in  EPHX1  gene were analyzed in  relation to ischemic stroke risk. Tyr113His variation results in  a   $39\%$   reduction in mEH enzyme activity, while His139Arg  variation causes a   $25\%$   increase in enzyme activity. Our  results suggested that there was no association between the  minor alleles and the disease status in the study group.  

No previous studies have analyzed  EPHX1  genetic  polymorphisms and ischemic stroke association, and stu­ dies carried out on various cancers have reported discor­ dant findings. To mention a few of these studies,  EPHX1  genetic polymorphisms were observed to be important risk  factors for susceptibility to various cancers, including  , 12  prostate cancer, lung cancer and acute lymph oblast ic  leukemia. The 113His allele was shown to be a risk  factor for lung carcinoma in Asians, whereas it was  observed to have a protective effect in Caucasians in  a recent meta-analysis. Moreover, a protective role has  been attributed to low mEH activity against childhood  lymph oblast ic leukemia. Furthermore, a meta-analysis  demonstrated a trend towards a protective effect of  His139Arg SNP against colorectal cancer risk. It is evi­ dent that the results deviate significantly among different  populations.  

The variant alleles of  EPHX1  (113His and   $139\mathrm{Arg})$  were observed to decrease the stroke susceptibility in  stratification analysis in this study. We observed a lower  risk for hypertension-related ischemic stroke in subjects  carrying at least one 113His allele   $(\mathrm{OR}{=}2.37]$  ) compared  with individuals with the wild-type genotype   $(\mathrm{OR}{=}3.21]$  ).  Because EETs have important functions in regulating the  vascular tone and cerebral blood flow, the effect of this  allele, which decreases the rate of EET metabolism, might  have become apparent in the stratification analysis based  on hypertension. The diabetes-related ischemic stroke risk  was also lower in 113His allele carriers   $(\mathrm{OR}{=}2.09)$  ) com­ pared with subjects with the wild-type genotype   $(\mathrm{OR}{=}2.19)$  ).  

It was also observed in this study that the OR for  having a hypertension-related ischemic stroke decreased  from 3.15 to 2.14 when at least one  EPHX1  139Arg allele  was present. This allele was found to increase the mEH  enzyme activity; 49  therefore, the a the rogen ic chemical  metabolism rate may have been enhanced in subjects pos­ sessing this allele. The link between diabetes mellitus and  atherosclerosis is well recognized; hence, diabetes mellitus  increases the risk of stroke by several fold. EPHX1  His139/His139 genotype carriers have been shown to  have a higher fasting insulin level and lower insulin sensi­ tivity compared to Arg139 allele carriers   $P{=}0.020$   and   ${\it P}{=}0.001$  , respectively), 51  which may mean that diabetic  complications are less severe in 139Arg allele carriers. In  this study, the 139Arg allele decreased the diabetes-related  ischemic stroke risk in stratification analysis.  

Hypertension, smoking and LDL-cholesterol were  found to be significant risk factors, and HDL-cholesterol  was found to be a protective factor for the occurrence of  ischemic stroke by logistic regression analysis, as also  , found in our previous studies. However, our study  had a limitation regarding the sample size of the healthy  control subjects, resulting from age restrictions in selecting  control subjects. Nevertheless, the power test result was  satisfactory; therefore, the results were considered statisti­ cally reliable.  

It is well known that the distribution of alleles for a given  genetic variant may markedly differ among populations.  Thus, we included a comparison of the minor allele frequen­ cies for  EPHX1  Tyr113His (rs1051740   $\mathrm{T{>}C}$  ),  EPHX1  His139Arg (rs2234922   $_{\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{G}}$  ) and  EPHX2  Arg287Gln   $\mathrm{(rs751141~G{>}A)}$  ) variants in the healthy control population  of this study with those in different control populations that  have previously been analyzed ( Table 6 ).  EPHX1  rs1051740  C allele (113His) was observed at a frequency of 0.31 in our  study and this frequency ranged from   $0.25^{11}$    to   $0.35^{52}$    in  other studies which were also carried out on the Turkish  population. , The frequency of 113His allele was low­ est in Indians   $\left(0.23\right)^{56}$    and highest in Taiwanese   $\left(0.48\right)^{57}$  among the other populations 32 , , ( Table 6 ). The  EPHX1  rs2234922 G (139Arg) allele frequency was  observed to be 0.19 in our study, which was exactly the  same as that reported by Sahin et   $\mathrm{{a}}^{55}$    and was close to this  value  in  other  studies  carried  out  on  Turkish  populations. , The frequency of this allele was deter­ 32 , , mined in several other populations and observed at  59  its lowest value (0.09) in a Chinese population and at its  highest value (0.41) in an African population.

few studies in the literature have been carried out on  EPHX2  Arg287Gln polymorphism ( Table 6 ). The frequency of the  minor rs751141A allele was found to be 0.09 in our popula­ tion and no other studies have been carried out on the  Turkish population. rs751141A allele frequency ranged  between 0.08, which was found in white Europeans, to  0.21, which was found in a Japanese population, among  , , , , other populations.  

In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the  first time that the association of  EPHX1  genetic polymorph­ isms with ischemic stroke risk has been analyzed. Although  EPHX1  variant alleles were not significantly associated with  ischemic stroke risk in the overall study group, the presence  of at least one 113His or 139Arg allele decreased the hyper­ tension- or diabetes-related ischemic stroke risk within the  subgroups. In addition, this work for the first time investi­ gated the association of Arg287Gln polymorphism of  EPHX2  and ischemic stroke risk in a Turkish population,  and the results showed that the polymorphic allele was not  significantly related to ischemic stroke. However, the  EPHX2  variant allele increased the risk of hypertension-related and  diabetes-related ischemic stroke in subgroup analysis. Thus,  combination of different genetic backgrounds with conven­ tional risk factors may change the risk of having ischemic  stroke in a significant manner.
