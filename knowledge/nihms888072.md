# Abstract  

Background— Inherited genetic variations offer a possible explanation for the observed  peculiarities of stroke in sub – Saharan African populations. Interleukin–6 polymorphisms have  been previously associated with ischemic stroke in some non-African populations.  

Aim— Herein we investigated, for the first time, the association of genetic polymorphisms of IL-6  and CDKN2A- CDKN2B and other genes with ischemic stroke among indigenous West African  participants in the Stroke Investigative Research and Education Network (SIREN) Study.  

Methods— Twenty-three previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14  genes of relevance to the neurobiology of ischemic stroke were investigated. Logistic regression  models adjusting for known cardiovascular disease risk factors were constructed to assess the  associations of the 24 SNPs in rigorously phenotyped cases   $\mathrm{(N{=}}429)$  ) of ischemic stroke (Men  $=$    198; Women  $=231$  ) and stroke– free   $\mathrm{(N}{=}483\$  ) controls (Men  $=236$  ; Women  $=247$  ).  

Results— Interleukin-6   $\mathit{(I L6)}$   rs1800796 (C minor allele; frequency: West Africans  $=8.6\%$  ) was  significantly associated with ischemic stroke in men   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.006$  ,  $95\%$   CI = [1.065, 3.777],  ${\mathfrak{p}}=$  0.031) with hypertension in the model but not in women. In addition, rs2383207 in CDKN2A/ CDKN2B (minor allele A with frequency: West Africans  $=1.7\%$  ) was also associated with  ischemic stroke in men   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.550$  ,   $95\%$   CI = [1.027, 6.331],  $\mathsf{p}=0.044)$  ) with primary covariates  in the model, but not in women. Polymorphisms in other genes did not show significant  association with ischemic stroke.  

Conclusion— Polymorphisms rs1800796 in  $_{I L6}$  gene and rs2383207 in CDKN2A/CDKN2B  gene have significant associations with ischemic stroke in indigenous West African men.  CDKN2A/CDKN2B SNP rs2383207 is independently associated with ischemic stroke in  indigenous West African men. Further research should focus on the contributions of inflammatory  genes and other genetic polymorphisms, as well as the influence of sex on the neurobiology of  stroke in people of African ancestry.

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is the clinical culmination of complex biological processes and interacting pathways  that involve non–genetic and genetic factors.  In fact, the burden of stroke has significant  race-ethnic and geographic disparities, with individuals of African ancestry being at higher  risk, and experiencing poorer outcomes than most other racial groups in the world. Inherited genetic variations offer a possible explanation for the observed peculiarities of  

stroke in sub – Saharan African populations, as well as the proportion of risk that remains  unexplained by traditional and emerging risk factors alone.  

Through multiple approaches including candidate gene, linkage studies, genome wide  association studies (GWAS) and whole exome sequencing, multiple susceptibility loci for  stroke have now been identified especially in populations of European ancestry, with fewer  studies among African Americans, and very little data on indigenous sub – Saharan  Africans.  Thus, the Stroke Investigative Research and Education Network (SIREN) study is  exploring genetic factors in stroke among West Africans using multi – level approaches.  We  herein report the findings of a candidate gene study using genotype and phenotype data from  ischemic stroke and stroke – free controls recruited into the SIREN Study. We investigated  the association and effect sizes of 23 selected SNPs with the occurrence of ischemic stroke  among indigenous West Africans.  

# METHODS  

# Study Population, Patient Enrollment and Data Acquisition  

The rationale and design of the SIREN study has been described elsewhere.  Essentially, the  SIREN study is a multi-center case-control study involving several sites in Nigeria and  Ghana which was initiated in August 2014 with an initial recruitment target of 3000 cases  and 3000 controls. The ethnographic characteristics of the study population are described in  detail in supplementary table 1. The ethnic groups include the Yoruba (Ibadan and Abeokuta  sites in southern Nigeria), the Hausa (Kano and Zaria in Northern Nigeria), the Akan, Ewe  and Ga/Adangbe (Accra and Kumasi, Southern and Northern Ghana).  Ethical approval  was obtained for all study sites and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Cases  included consecutively recruited consenting adults (aged 18 years or older) with first clinical  stroke within 8 days of current symptom onset or ‘last seen without deficit’ with  confirmatory cranial CT or MRI scan performed within 10 days of symptom onset. We  excluded individuals with stroke mimics, primary sub ara ch noid hemorrhage and previous  strokes which were not ascertained by neuro imaging. Stroke-free status of controls recruited  for the SIREN was ascertained using a locally-validated version of the Questionnaire for  Verifying Stroke-Free Status (QVSFS) with a modification to include pictograms of stroke  symptoms with improved sensitivity and specificity.  

We collected basic demographic and lifestyle data including ethnicity and native language of  the subjects and their parents, socioeconomic status, dietary patterns, routine physical  activity, stress, depression, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use as well as cardiovascular and  an thro po metric measurements using standard techniques. A detailed neurologic evaluation  was conducted to assess neurologic deficits and determine stroke severity using the National  Institute of Health Stroke Severity Score. Blood samples were collected from cases and  controls at baseline for measuring fasting lipid profile, blood glucose and HbA1c. Stroke  diagnosis and phe no typing was undertaken using the ACCESS software [Patent No:  NG/PT/NC/2016/2007] based on clinical evaluation and brain neuro imaging (brain CT or  MRI).  

# Description of Covariates  

Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dys lipid emi a, and central adiposity were used as  dichotomous covariates in the models and are described in Table 1. Dys lipid emi a was  defined in accordance with the recommendations of the US National Cholesterol Education  Program 10 .  

# Selection of stroke candidate genes and SNPs  

Through an extensive literature review 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 14  candidate genes with published and /or suspected association with ischemic stroke risk were  selected for genotyping (Table 2). Majority of these were SNPs already associated with  ischemic strokes and validated in at least more than one cohort. However, selection of the  APOL1 G1 [rs73885319 and rs60910145] was largely exploratory based on recent data  suggesting increasing role of the APOL1 in cardiovascular disease in people of African  ancestry.  

# Genotyping and Quality Control Method  

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood with Gentra Systems PUREGENE DNA  purification kit (Qiagen Group) according to manufacturers’ protocol. Genotyping was  carried out on genomic DNA from 506 stroke cases and 506 stroke free controls randomly  selected from among the entire cohort of recruited subjects as described above. The  genotyping was performed at Northwest Genomics Center in Washington Seattle, USA,  using an ABI TaqMan SNP genotyping assays by Design (Applied Systems) under  conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Probe and primer sequences for each assay  are available on request. The assays were originally selected for 24 published vascular  disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Table 2) and included 3 SNPs  on pro-inflammatory genes (  $_{I L6}$  and CD14) genes which have been previously reported to  be associated with ischemic stroke in African Americans. Standard quality control  procedures were applied to the genotype data using all SNPs on the chip. We also genotyped  sickle cell SNP rs334 to control for confounding due to sickle cell trait.  

# Excluded subjects  

After rigorous quality control of genotype data, individuals with sex disc or dance between  reported and observed from genetic data and 44 cases with hemorrhagic stroke were  excluded. There were 4 samples with sickle cell anemia and 5 samples with missing  genotype for rs334 (Supplementary Table 2). After excluding participants whose genotype  data did not pass quality control, the study sample consisted of 912 subjects (429 ischemic  stroke cases and 483 stroke – free controls).  

# Power calculation  

With the 429 cases and 483 controls, we can observe minimum OR of 2.8 with correction  for multiple testing   $\left(\mathbf{a}\mathbf{=}0.05/23\mathbf{=}0.002\right)$  ) with allele frequency as low as 0.02. However, we  can observe minimum OR of 2.06 with correction for multiple testing   $\left(\mathrm{a}\mathrm{=}0.05/23\mathrm{=}0.002\right)$    with allele frequency as low as 0.05.  

# Association Methods  

All statistical analyses were performed using PLINK1.9. We compared proportions or means  by two-sided t-tests and for stratified samples with respect to sex we used  $\chi^{2}$   tests or  Fisher’s exact test if the cell size was less than 5. All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium except rs60910145 in APOL1 gene   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!2.3\times10^{-6})$  ) (Supplementary Table 3). To  test for associations between ischemic stroke status and each single SNP, we fitted logistic  regression models in which each SNP was modeled as a predictor variable whose values  were equal to the number of copies of the minor allele   $(0,1,2)$   (i.e., additive mode of  inheritance). The primary fitted model included age, sex ethnicity and rs334 (sickle cell  status) as covariates. Majority of the individuals were from Akan, Yoruba, and Hausa. The  other ethnicities were combined as one to avoid small sample size issues within each  categories. Ethnicity was modeled as categorical variable. Recruitment site was not  significant in any of our analysis due to strict protocol followed at each site. Therefore, we  did not use site in the model. Furthermore, we also performed sex stratified logistic  regression because of reported gender disparities in stroke prevalence, incidence, severity  and outcomes.  In the primary sensitivity analysis model, we added history of  hypertension, while in the secondary model we further added dichotomous variables for  diabetes, dys lipid emi a, and waist-hip as predictors defined in table 1 step-wisely to ascertain  whether these covariates had independent effects. The statistical models are described below.  

# Analyzed Models  

• Model 1 (Primary Model):  SNP  $+$   Age  $+$   Sickle-Cell Status  $^+$   Ethnicity • Model 2 (Model  $^{1+}$  Hypertension):  SNP  $+$   Age  $+$  Sickle-Cell Status  $^+$    Ethnicity  $+$    Hypertension • Model 3 (Model  $^{2+}$   Diabetes):  SNP  $^+$   Age  $+$  Sickle-Cell Status  $^+$   Ethnicity  $+$  Hypertension  $+$    Diabetes • Model 4 (Model  $^{3+}$   Dys lipid emi a):  SNP  $^+$   Age  $^+$   Sickle-Cell Status  $^+$    Ethnicity  $+$   Hypertension  $^+$   Diabetes  $+$    Dys lipid emi a • Model 5 (Model  $^{4+}$   waist-hip-ratio):  $\mathrm{SNR}+\mathrm{Age}+$  Sickle-Cell-Status  $+$    Ethnicity  $+$   Hypertension  $^+$   Diabetes  $+$   Dys lipid emi a  $^+$    waist-hip-ratio  

In addition, we ran exact logistic regression analysis to ensure that our results were not  affected by small or zero cell counts for covariates used in the sensitivity analysis.  

# RESULTS  

# Subject Characteristics and Distribution of Covariates  

The demographic and risk factor characteristics by case-control status are described in Table  3. The mean age of the subjects with ischemic stroke was 61.34   $(\pm12.83)$   years while the  mean age of stroke – free control subjects was   $60.26\;(\pm\;12.56)$   years   $(\mathsf{p}=\!0.2001)$  ). Cases  were significantly more likely than controls to have a history of hypertension (  $90\%$   vs.  $42\%$  )  (p  ${<}0.0001\rangle$  ), diabetes   $39\%$   vs   $14\%$  ) (p   ${<}0.0001\$  ), dys lipid emi a (  $87\%$   vs.  $58\%$  )   $(\mathsf{p}<\!0.0001)$  )  and abnormal waist – hip ratio (  $25\%$   vs.  $11\%$  )   $(\mathsf{p}<\!0.0001)$  ), whereas there were no  

statistically significant differences between cases and controls with respect to age   $(\mathrm{p}{=}0.233)$  ),  sex   $\mathrm{\Delta(p{=}0.4528)}$  ), ethnicity   $(\mathsf{p}\colon0.0830-0.8871)$  , and recruitment site (p: 0.192 – 1.000). The  ischemic stroke subtypes are as shown in Table 3. Hypertension is often undiagnosed in the  population, and so duration as well as family history may not be accurate. However, known  family history of hypertension in parents or siblings was absent in 300 cases and 394  controls. Smoking and atrial fibrillation were not important risk factors in this population.  The percentage of those with atrial fibrillation was  $\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.<5\%$   while smoking was also rare. Waist  – hip ratio was included as a measure of obesity rather than BMI (Table 3).  

# Genotyping  

We genotyped 23 candidate SNPs in 14 genes that have been previously associated with  stroke risk (Table 2), including APOL1 G1 SNP variants and HBB SNP rs334 (a surrogate  SNP for sickle cell anemia). Genotypic distribution of rs334 is provided in Supplementary  Table 2. SNP rs74475935 in candidate gene ABCC1 was missing in all individuals due to  failed assay and SNP rs60910145 in APOL1 was not in HWE   $\mathrm{(p{=}}2.3\mathrm{E}{-6}\mathrm{)}$  ). Details of the  minor allele and its frequency in both cases and controls, genotypic distribution of each SNP  in controls, HWE p-values, gene names reported by ANNOVAR, SNP function,  comparisons of allele frequencies with 1000 Genome project populations, and functional  score CADD are described in Supplementary Table 3.  

# Association  

We did not observe any significant association with stroke when case-control analysis was  done using sex and other covariates in the primary logistic regression model as described in  the methods section. However, when we analyzed case-control sex-stratified data, we  observed rs1800796 in IL  $\cdot\mathcal{G}$  (minor allele C with frequency  $=\!8.6\%$   in controls and  $9.4\%$   in  cases (  $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.645$  ;   $95\%$   CI: 0.971–2.789; p-value  $\mathsf{\Lambda}=\!0.065$  ) and rs2383207 in CDKN2A/ CDKN2B (minor allele A with frequency  $=\!1.7\%$   in controls and   $2.7\%$   in cases) was  significant with p-value  $=\!0.044$   (  $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.550$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 1.027–6.331) with only primary  covariates in the model. The effect sizes and p-values for both SNPs are detailed in Table 4  including sensitivity analyses. In the sensitivity analysis, rs1800796 in IL-6 was significant  with p-value  $\mathord{=}0.031$   (  $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.006$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 1.065–3.777) with hypertension in the model; pvalue  $=\!0.038$   (  $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.957$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 1.038–3.690) with the addition of diabetes to the model;  p-value  $\mathrm{=}0.051$     $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.886$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 0.998–3.564) with further addition of dys lipid emi a to  the model; and p-value   $(\mathrm{p}{=}0.132)$  ) was not significant when we finally added waist-hip-ratio.  Similarly, rs2383207 in CDKN2A/CDKN2B was not significant with hypertension,  diabetes, and dys lipid emi a in the model. However, the rs2383207 in CDKN2A/CDKN2B  became significant when we added waist-hip-ratio to the model. The results for male only  analyses for all SNPs are detailed in the Supplementary Table 4 and the results for nongenetic covariates are given in the Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 for SNPs rs1800796 and  rs2383207, respectively. Furthermore the significance of   $I L6\,\mathrm{{SNP}}$   was confirmed using  exact logistic regression with 20K burn in and 100K interactions with the primary model as  well as when the models included other covariates (Supplementary Table 7). The association  of rs2383207 in CDKN2B-AS1 was not significant with the primary model, inclusion of  hypertension and diabetes. However, rs2383207 was significant with p-value 0.044 with  inclusion of dys lipid emi a in the model. In supplementary table 8, we compare the effect size  and direction for IL-6 SNP rs1800796 with previous reports.  

In the step-wise analyses, ethnicity, hypertension, dys lipid emi a, diabetes, and waist-hip ratio  risk were significant irrespective of SNP in the model (Supplementary Table 5). Specifically,  in the final model with all covariates and rs1800796 in the model, ethnicity (Akan:  $\tt p{=}0.004$  ;  Hausa:  $\tt p{=}0.004$  ; and other:  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.733)$  ), hypertension (3.93E-15), diabetes   $(\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.039)$  ),  dys lipid emi a (1.77E-05), and waist-hip ratio risk   $\mathbf{\hat{p}}{=}0.004$  ). Also in the final model with all  covariates and rs2383207 in the model ethnicity (Akan:  $\tt p{=}0.006$  ; Hausa:  $\tt p{=}0.005$  ; and other:   $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.635$  ), hypertension   $\mathrm{(p{=}8.17E{-}15)}$  ), diabetes   $\mathrm{\varphi{p}=\!0.038\!\mathrm{\rangle}}$  ), dys lipid emi a (  $\mathrm{\Deltap{=}}6.23\mathrm{E{-}}06\mathrm{\Delta}$  ), and  waist-hip ratio risk   $(\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.001$  ). Thus, it implies that ethnicity, hypertension, dys lipid emi a,  diabetes, and waist-hip ratio risk were independent predictors of ischemic stroke. We did not  include smoking and atrial fibrillation in the regression models because they were not  important stroke risk factors in this population. The percentage of those with atrial  fibrillation was   ${\tt<5\%}$   and smoking was also rare (Table 3). We also did not include family  history and duration of hypertension in the regression analysis model because they were  largely presumed. Note that Yoruba sample was the largest sample, so the program used  Yoruba sample as a reference sample in the analysis.  

To see whether the difference of SNP-stroke association between sex-stratified analyses was  significant or it was due to small sample size, we included SNP by sex interaction in the  final model without sex-stratified sample and observed the following results: The interaction  p-values for  $\mathrm{sec}\times\mathrm{rs1}\mathrm{800796}$   and   $\mathrm{sec}\times\mathrm{rs}2383207$   were 0.08 and 0.06 respectively showing  marginal significance. The female − specific sex-stratified logistic regression analysis results  are shown in Supplementary Table 8.  

# DISCUSSION  

In this first ever case – control study of genetic polymorphisms associated with ischemic  stroke among West Africans, we found that the polymorphisms rs1800796 in the  interleukin–6 gene and rs2383207 in the CDKN2A/CDKN2B gene were associated with  nominal significance with the occurrence of ischemic stroke in men. This also represents the  first report of the analysis of association of any inflammatory genetic polymorphism  (rs1800796) and cardiovascular polymorphism (rs2383207) with stroke occurrence in sub–  Saharan Africa.  

The finding of the significant association between IL-6 rs1800796 and ischemic stroke is  congruent with previous reports of similar association of IL-6 polymorphisms with ischemic  stroke among African American 21 , American Caucasian 22  Japanese 23  northern Chinese   ${\mathrm{Ham}}^{24,25}$   and northern Indian 26  populations. The odds ratio reported in this study lies within  the range of 1.40 – 2.50 previously reported in other studies 21–26 , noting that differences in  effect size may be due to differences in sample size and the sex – stratified analysis  undertaken in the present study (Table 5). The IL-6 promoter gene polymorphisms G174C  (rs1800795),C572G (rs1800796) and IL6 rs2069832 have been particularly associated with  the occurrence of ischemic stroke  while IL6 rs2069830 was protective against ischemic  stroke among African American non – smokers in a biracial study.  While previous studies  did not conduct stratified analysis to explore the effect of sex, the significant association  between IL-6 rs1800796 gene and rs2383207 CDKN2A/CDKN2B and ischemic stroke in  men only agrees with a recent study of Li et al. (2015) using integrated microarray datasets,  in which IL-6 gene expression was significantly up regulated in male patients but down –  regulated in female patients.  This evidence provides a possible genetic basis for gender  disparity in the epidemiology of stroke .  

The human interleukin – 6 (IL-6) gene is located on chromosome 7p21 and consists of 5  exons and 4 introns. The promoter polymorphisms of IL-6 regulate the circulating plasma  level of this pleiotropic cytokine which plays critical roles in the acute inflammatory  response and regulation of acute phase proteins such as C – reactive protein. It also  contributes to the inflammatory response by triggering endo the li al dysfunction and  activating the coagulation – fi bri no lysis system.  Studies have demonstrated association  of serum levels of biomarkers of inflammation such as Interleukin – 6, C – reactive protein  and fibrinogen with such conditions as stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular  deaths.  Serum and cerebrospinal fluid IL–6 levels have also been associated with greater  stroke severity, larger infarct volume and worse functional outcomes as well as carotid artery  intima – media thickness, other vascular brain diseases (white matter hyper intensities and  lacunar infarction), vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.  Fine  particulate matter air pollution has been associated with elevated plasma levels of IL-6. The recently published report on the Global Burden of Disease 2013 (GBD 2013) study  demonstrated the significant contribution of household air pollution to the risk of stroke  especially in low and middle income countries, the largest risk been reported from the West  African sub – region.  The significant association of   $I\!L\!-6$  polymorphism and stroke in this  study strengthens the putative contribution of air pollution (which triggers chronic  inflammation and atherosclerosis) to stroke risk in the West African sub- region, and this  warrants further detailed investigation.  

The CDKN2A/CDKN2B gene is located in the intron of cyclin – dependent kinase inhibitor  2B anti sense RNA   $1^{36}$   and associated with type 2 DM and cerebral infarction (Table 2). It  was also implicated in large artery stroke in the COMPASS Consortium 37 . It became  significant in the current study when waist –hip-ratio was added to the sensitivity analysis in  the presence of ethnicity, hypertension, type 2 DM, and dys lipid emi a. This might suggest a  possible confounding effect although waist-hip ratio was an independent predictor of stroke.  

The association of both IL  $^{6}$  and CDKN2A/CDKN2B genes with ischemic stroke have been  confirmed by the COMPASS consortium and other previous studies although there were no  specific data from stratified analysis based on gender and obesity.  However, IL- 6 as a  multi functional cytokine plays a key role in chronic inflammation and SNP rs1800796 is  associated with susceptibility to several diseases including breast cancer , osteoarthritis 40  and membranous g lo merulo path y 41 . Furthermore, the sex disparity related to IL-6  polymorphisms is not limited to stroke but also influences susceptibility to other diseases.  One of such studies conducted in China suggested that rs1800796 polymorphism of the   $I\!L\!-\!\!\delta$  gene was associated with susceptibility to HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma in a male  Chinese Han population.  Our rigorous association analysis which adequately controlled  for con founders and duly considered LD structure did not establish an association of   $A P O E$  alleles with ischemic stroke in our cohort contrary to an earlier finding in a small Zambian  stroke cohort.  The lack of association of the HBB rs334 and stroke in this study suggests  that the sickle cell carrier status may not be a significant risk factor for stroke in the  population under study.  

This study has limitations. We only evaluated a limited number of SNPs identified in prior  stroke genetic studies and were unable to study rare variants due to limited sample size and  thus lack of adequate power to observe small effect loci with multiple test correction  although our study had adequate power to detect larger effect loci. We would have needed  984 matched case-control pairs to observe an OR of 1.5 with minor allele frequency of   $8.6\%$   $({\sim}0.09)$   similar to IL-6 rs1800796 while 3960 matched case-control pairs would have been  needed to observe an OR of 1.5 with minor allele frequency of   $1.7\%$     $(\mathord{\sim}0.02)$   similar to  CDKN2A/CDKN2B rs2383207. Supplementary Table 9 shows sample size calculations  corresponding to an OR less than or equal to 1.5 and minor allele frequency varying from  0.01 to 0.2 to further illustrate the sample size limitation of our study to replicate the  associated candidate SNPs. Thirdly, we did not evaluate relationship with plasma protein  activity. Finally, we did not adjust for population structure due to un availability of ancestry  informative markers in this current study. This is because we acknowledge that multi –  ethnicity raises the possibility that certain findings may result from the confounding effects  of genetic differences among populations. However, multi – ethnicity of the sample could  boost our understanding of the scope and generality of any findings, because pan-ethnic  rep li c ability of association between a candidate SNP and trait outcome provides support for  a causal relationship.  

Another advantage of having an ethnically diverse sample is that patterns of linkage  d is equilibrium may differ ethnically, helping to resolve causal from non-causal relationships.  While populations with high linkage d is equilibrium may be useful for initial detection of  SNP associations, several different SNPs may be in strong or complete d is equilibrium.  Populations with lower levels of d is equilibrium can help resolve which SNP effect is  primary. Africans appear to have the lowest levels of linkage d is equilibrium and hence are  likely to be most useful for such analyses.  Certain SNPs have been previously detected in  stroke patients in other populations.  Therefore, searching for such among diverse ethnic  groups in Africans and African Americans using the candidate gene approach is a good  starting point for exploring stroke genomics in this unique population.  

Our future work will examine our current findings and all current GWAS hits with greater  power and breadth within the context of a genome wide association studies on the entire  SIREN cohort of 6000 subjects, whole genome sequencing in an enriched sub-cohort of  familial small vessel disease (lacunar stroke), external validation of findings in other genetic  stroke cohorts and consortia, pathway – based analyses and functional genomic studies to  facilitate translational applications.  

# CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS  

We observed that the polymorphisms rs1800796 in the interleukin-6 gene and rs2383207 in  CDKN2A/CDKN2B were associated with ischemic stroke in men with nominal significance  but not women in West Africa. Certainly, further research is needed to more clearly  understand the contributions of sex, other inflammatory genes and other genetic  polymorphisms (including ang io genesis and obesity genes) to the neurobiology of stroke in  people of African ancestry.
