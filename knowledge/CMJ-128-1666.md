# Abstract  

Background:  Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the formation and progression of ischemic stroke. Recently, more and more  epidemiological studies have focused on the association between C‑reactive protein (CRP)   $-717\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{G}$   and  $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$  genetic  polymorphisms and ischemic stroke. However, the findings of these researches are not conclusive.  

Methods:  We performed a meta‑analysis to determine whether these two polymorphisms are associated with the risk of ischemic stroke.  Eligible studies were identified from the database of PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Weipu, and Wanfang. We  calculated odds ratios   $(O R\mathrm{{s})}$   with   $95\%$   confidence intervals   $(C I{\mathrm{s}})$   to assess the strength of the association.  

Results:  Four articles were included in our study, including 1926 cases and 2678 controls for  $-717\mathrm{A}\!>\!\mathrm{G}$   polymorphism, 652 cases and 1103  controls for  $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$   polymorphism. The results of meta‑analysis showed that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  $-717\mathrm{A}\!>\!\mathrm{G}$    was not significantly associated with the risk of ischemic stroke (GG vs. AA,   $O R=1.12$  ,   $95\%$     $C I=0.83–1.50$  ,  $P=0.207$  ;   $\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{CA}$  vs. AA,   $O R=1.04$  ,   $95\%$     $C I=0.93–1.17$  ,  $P=0.533$  ; GG vs.   $\mathrm{GABA}+\mathrm{AA}$  ,   $O R=1.10$  ,   $95\%$     $C I=0.82–1.47$  ,    $P=0.220$  ). Meta‑analysis of   $\mathrm{SNR}-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$   also demonstrated no statistical evidence of a significant association with the risk of ischemic stroke (AA vs. CC,   $O R=0.86$  ,  $95\%$     $C I=0.59–1.25$  ,    $P=0.348$  ; AA vs. CC,   $O R=0.92$  ,   $95\%$     $C I=0.80{-}1.06$  ,    $P=0.609$  ; AA vs. CC,   $O R=0.89$  ,   $95\%$     $C I=0.62–1.30$  ,  $P=0.374\$  ).  

Conclusions:  This meta‑analysis demonstrated little evidence to support a role of CRP gene  $-717\mathrm{A}\!>\!\mathrm{G}$  ,  $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$   polymorphisms  in ischemic stroke predisposition. However, to draw comprehensive and more reliable conclusions, further larger studies are needed to  validate the association between CRP gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke in various ethnic groups.

Ischemic stroke constitutes approximately  $85\%$   of all strokes  and has caused a large number of deaths globally.  Much  effort has been taken over the past decade to gain new  insights into the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke, with a  large number of genetic markers discovered via family  and twins studies.  Since then many epidemiologic and  molecular studies have emerged to test the hypothesis that  genetic variations may be associated with a predisposition  to this heterogeneous disease.  

Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the formation and  progression of ischemic stroke, which represents an  important causative factor for ischemic stroke.  C‑reactive  protein (CRP, gene ID: 1401) belongs to the pentraxin protein  family and functions through Fc‑gamma receptors to defend  against inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases.   There is mounting evidence of serum CRP level as a predictor  of ischemic stroke.  The human CRP gene with a spanning  size of 2880 bps is mapped at chromosome 1 at q21–q23. The  magnitude of CRP expression is genetically determined, and  almost half of the alternation depends on host factors.  As  CRP gene variations involves in the regulation of the protein  level,  investigating the association of the single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) and ischemic stroke susceptibility  may have diagnostic and prognostic implications.  

The promoter SNPs in CRP gene, CRP   $-717\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{G}$  and   $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$   gene polymorphisms, were proposed  as possible biomarkers and suggested to be used to  predict ischemic stroke in some researches.  However  other studies showed that the development of ischemic  stroke should not attribute to CRP SNPs.  In view of  the inconsistent reports, we undertook a meta‑analysis  to determine whether the risk of ischemic stroke is  associated with CRP  $-717\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{G}$   and   $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$   gene  polymorphisms.  

# M ethods  

# Literature retrieval strategy  

To identify eligible studies on the association between   $\mathrm{CRP}\!-\!717\mathrm{A\!>\!G}$   and  $-286\mathrm{C}\,{>}\,\mathrm{T}\,{>}\,\mathrm{A}$   genetic polymorphisms  and ischemic stroke, we performed a literature search of  published studies in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of  Science, CNKI database, Weipu database, and Wanfang  database from 1980 to April 2014. The keywords we used  are as follows: CRP or C‑reactive protein, polymorphism  or polymorphisms or genetic variants, as well as ischemic  stroke. Besides, we inspected references of all identified  studies for further relevant studies.  

# Selection criteria  

Studies were included in the meta‑analysis if they met all  of the following criteria: (1) Used a case‑control design  or cohort design; (2) investigated the association between  CRP  $-717\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{G}$   and  $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$   gene polymorphisms  and ischemic stroke risk; (3) contained sufficient data which  could help to calculate an odds ratio and   $95\%$   confidence  intervals (  $\it{O R}$   and   $95\%$    CI s); (4) genotype distribution in  controls was in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).  

# Data extraction  

Two authors independently extracted data from the  included studies onto the standard, data‑collection forms.  To facilitate a general understanding of the eligible studies,  in addition to allele and genotype data, two investigators  also extracted the first author’s surname, publication year,  subjects’ ethnicity, matching, control sources, DNA source,  number of cases and controls,    $P$    value for HWE wherever  possible, and measurement methods in duplicate. If there  were disagreements on conflicting data, discussion among  all investigators would be held to solve them.  

# Statistical analysis  

Based on the genotype data in controls, we tested HWE for  all studies using the goodness‑of‑fit Chi‑square test. The  association between CRP SNPs and ischemic stroke risk was  evaluated using crude  $O R$   with  $95\%$    CI . Summary  OR s were  calculated assuming homozygote, dominant and recessive  contrast models for both SNPs.  

Inconsistency across studies (heterogeneity) was determined  with the Chi‑square‑based   $\mathcal{Q}$  ‑test and the   $I^{2}$   metric.  If  $P$    values above 0.10 or   $I^{2}$   more than   $50\%$  , which means  significant heterogeneity, we appropriately selected the  random‑effects model  (Mantel and Haenszel method)  to calculate the effects size; otherwise, the fixed‑effects  model (Der Simoni an and Laird method) was performed.  

Sensitivity analysis, Egger’s test and Begg’s funnel  plot were performed respectively to examine the  stability and reliability of the combined effects in this  meta‑analysis.  All statistical data were analyzed with  STATA software (version 12.0, STATA Corp., College  Station, TX, USA). All two‑tailed  $P$    values were considered  as significant at 0.10 unless specially stated.  

# R esults  

# Literature retrieval  

A total of 461 records matching the search terms were  obtained from the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of  Science, CNKI database, Weipu database, and Wanfang  database. Through carefully reading the titles and abstracts,  four potential articles were identified.  According to the  above‑mentioned criteria, we excluded one publication,  which was not designed as case‑control or cohort.  Another  study was identified through manual search.  Finally, four  articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the  meta‑analysis.  

# Characteristics of the studies  

For the  $-717\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{G}$   polymorphism, 1926 ischemia stroke  cases and 2678 controls from four articles were identified  to estimate the relationship between the polymorphism  and ischemia stroke risk.  For the   $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$  polymorphism, 652 ischemia stroke cases and 1103 controls  from three articles were analyzed to assess the association  between the polymorphism and ischemia stroke risk.   For the studies finally considered in this meta‑analysis,  there was an equal distribution with respect to ethnicity.  However, they varied in the control source from clinic  to the hospital, and in genotyping measurements from  TaqMan to polymerase chain reaction‑restriction fragment  length polymorphism. Inconsistency with HWE was not  seen in any control group   $(P>0.10)$  ) [Table 1].  

# Meta‑analysis results  

As shown in Table 1, only one single study demonstrated  that the   $-717\mathrm{GHz}$   genotype was associated with over  two‑fold greater risk of ischemic stroke compared to  the −717AA genotype or the AA and GA genotypes (GG  vs. AA,   $\mathrm{OR}=2.09$  ,  $95\%$     $C I\!=1.01$  –4.35; GG vs.  $\mathrm{GABA}+\mathrm{AA}$  ,   $O R\,=\,2.09$  ,   $95\%$     $C I=\;1.01–4.33)$  ). Such a significant  association was lost when all studies were pooled into a  meta‑analysis (GG vs. AA,  $O R=1.12$  ,  $95\%$     $C I\!=\!0.83\!-\!1.50$  ,  $P\!=\!0.207$  ; GG + GA vs. AA,  $l R=1.04,95\%\,C l{=}\,0.93{-}1.17$  ,  $P\!=\!0.533$  ; GG vs.  $\mathrm{GABA}\,+\mathrm{AA}$  ,  $O R=1.10$  ,  $95\%\,C I\!=\!0.82\!-\!1.47$  ,  $P=0.220$  ) [Figures 1 and 2, Table 1].  

In terms of the analysis of  $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$   polymorphism in  total subjects, we did not observe any statistical difference  in each single dataset, nor in the combined dataset  (AA vs. CC,   $O R=0.86$  ,   $95\%$     $C I=0.59-1.25$  ,  $P=0.348$  ;  AA vs. CC,   $O R=0.92$  ,   $95\%$     $C I=0.80\AA-1.06$  ,  $P=0.609$  ;  AA vs. CC,   $O R=0.89$  ,   $95\%$     $C I=0.62\AA-1.30$  ,    $P=0.374$  )  [Figures 1 and 2, Table 1].

Heterogeneity was not so obvious in studies of  $-717\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{G}$  polymorphism   $(I^{2}\,=\,32.1\%$  ,    $P\,=\,0.220$  ) and there was  no heterogeneity in the studies of the   $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$  polymorphism (  $I^{2}=16.6\%$  ,  $P=0.303\$  ).  

# Sensitivity analysis  

We sequentially excluded one single study from the overall  pooled analysis and recalculated the summary  OR s to check  whether the summary  OR s were materially changed. The  recalculated  OR s were found stable, indicating our results  were valuable (data not shown).

degrees leads to great interest into the ischemic stroke genetic  research.  More and more epidemiologic and molecular  evidence over the past 10 years has validated the CRP as an  ischemic stroke susceptibility locus.  Given that a minor  change in the protein level of CRP, affected by the promoter  polymorphisms, might lead to a significantly increased  likelihood of ischemic stroke, lots of association researches  have been performed to assess the possible relations between  CRP   $-717\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{G}$   and   $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$   polymorphism and  the ischemic stroke risk. However, these studies drew  controversial conclusions. The majority of studies did not find  these polymorphisms playing a role in the disease,  but  some study was on the other hand.  Hence, we conducted  this meta‑analysis to assess the association between these two  CRP polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk.  

Based on four studies, containing 4604 subjects for  $-717\mathrm{A}\!>\!\mathrm{G}$  polymorphism and 1755 subjects for   $\mathrm{~-~}286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$  polymorphism, we found that the  $-717\mathrm{A}\!>\!\mathrm{G}$   might not play  a major role in the development of ischemic stroke, and the  meta‑analysis results showed that both of the C allele and  the A allele of SNP  $-286\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{A}$   were not associated with  a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke in general  population. Our findings are consistent with the results of  most included studies.  

The most likely cause for our negative results is the inadequate  sample size. Only four studies were included, and the small  sample size could increase the probability of false negative.  Moreover, complex interactions between genetic and  environmental factors were reported to play important roles  during the malignant progression of ischemic stroke. Ethnicity  is one of the environmental factors. The incidence rate of  ischemic stroke in Asians, especially in East Asian, is obviously  lower than that of the Caucasians and blacks,  suggesting  that Asian populations may be less susceptible to ischemic  stroke than Caucasian and black populations. Individuals of  different ethnicities have different lifestyles, dietary patterns,  and residential environments; other environmental factors  include age, gender, family history and so on. An unfavorable  combination of these factors may influence the results.  

Although all the included studies were case‑control  studies, which had no inconsistency with HWE in any  control group, no changed results of sensitive analysis, our  meta‑analysis still has some limitations. First, only four  studies were included and the sample size is inadequate.  Second, we are not allowed to identify whether the CRP  gene polymorphisms predispose to ischemic stroke in an  ethnicity‑dependent manner or not, due to the inaccessibility  of raw data. Third, genetic predisposition may differ  depending on the age, gender, and other con founders. Hence  interplay of genetic and environmental factors should be  considered on condition that original articles report sufficient  data. Moreover, as there may be unpublished data beyond our  reach, we cannot assure inclusion of all studies which meet  all of the selection criteria of this analysis, although we have  put equal emphasis on publications during literature search.  However, meta‑analysis has stronger statistical power than  any individual study in detecting genetic correlation, the  results revealed in our analysis are trustworthy.  

# C onclusion  

This meta‑analysis revealed little evidence to support  a role of CRP gene polymorphisms in ischemic stroke  predisposition. However, to draw comprehensive and more  reliable conclusions, further larger studies are needed to  validate the association between CRP gene polymorphisms  and ischemic stroke in various ethnic groups.
