# Abstract  

Background and Purpose:  Cardiovascular risk factors, which are overall more prevalent in  men, are considered the major risk factors for strokes amongst young adults. However, recent  European data found the incidence of strokes to be higher in young women. Using a large U.S.  claims sample, we examined sex differences in the index stroke rate of young adults.  

Methods:  We performed a retrospective cohort study of enrollees in a  $10\%$   random sample of  P har Metrics, a nationally representative claims database of insured Americans from 2001 to 2014.  Outcomes were index ischemic stroke events, based on inpatient admissions using ICD-9 codes.  The index stroke rate was estimated from Poisson rate models with time varying covariates for  two-year periods, stratified by sex and age groups.  

Results:  We identified 20,554 index strokes(  $50.4\%$   women; mean age 63) including 5,198 in  young adults ages 15-54. There was no difference by sex in the index stroke rate in the extremes of  age groups 15-24 and   $\mathord{\geq}75$   years old. However, in the 25-34 and 35-44 year age groups, more  women had strokes than men (Incidence Rate Ratio(IRR) men:women 0.70,  $95\%{\mathrm{CI}}{:}0.57{\cdot}0.86$  ;  0.87,  $95\%{\tt C I:}0.78{\small-}0.98,$  , respectively). In contrast, in the 45-54, 55-64 ,and 65-74 year age groups,  more men had strokes(IRR  $1.25\;95\%$  CI:1.16-1.33; 1.41  $95\%$  CI:1.18-1.34; 1.18  $95\%$  CI:1.12-125,  respectively).  

Conclusions:  More young women than men have strokes, suggesting possible importance of  sex-mediated etiologies of stroke. Understanding these drivers is critical to stroke treatment and  prevention efforts in young adults.

# INTRODUCTION  

While stroke incidence in older adults has declined dramatically, stroke in young adults  continues to rise.  The social and economic burden of strokes in young adults are substantial  due to loss of prime productive years, longer time spent with disability, and increased  mortality.  Despite the severity of these long-term consequences, etiologies of strokes in the  young remain poorly understood.  

Cardiovascular risk factors are considered the major drivers of strokes amongst young  adults,  and prior studies found cardiovascular risk factors to be more prevalent among  young adults with strokes than their peers in the general population.  However, data from  Europe suggests that despite having fewer cardiovascular risk factors, young women have  more strokes than men.  More recently, a Dutch cohort of young adults found that women  had strokes at a younger age with fewer vascular risk factors.  Studying stroke in young  adults is challenging because the incidence is relatively low and additional studies are  necessary to verify these novel findings.  

Using a large U.S. longitudinal administrative sample, we examine whether sex-based  differences in young adult stroke incidence also exist in the U.S. and whether these  differences changed over time.  

# METHODS  

This retrospective cohort study includes a   $10\%$   randomly selected sample of a large  commercial health insurance database, P har Metrics, including all paid medical and  pharmacy claims for more than 70 million members across the U.S. Subjects were included  in this study if they were (1)at least 15 years old and (2)enrolled continuously for at least six  consecutive months between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2014. This study protocol,  which relied on a pre-existing, de-identified database, was ‘exempt’ by the University of  Colorado Institutional Review Board and patient consent was waived. The data that support  the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable  request.  

# Outcomes and Variables  

Stroke was defined as an inpatient admission with acute ischemic stroke as the primary  diagnosis(using ICD-9 codes 433.x1, 434.x1, and 436).  The first inpatient admission for  stroke was considered the index stroke event. Patients with a previous outpatient or inpatient  diagnosis of any cerebro vascular disease were excluded. We were only interested in the  index stroke event to estimate the incidence of stroke, which reduces confounding from  stroke recurrence by sex.  

# Statistical Approach  

The index stroke rate was estimated from Poisson rate models with time varying covariates  for two-year periods by age group. Comparisons between index stroke rates were estimated  using incident rate ratios(IRR) of men:women. Interactions between sex and calendar year  were tested for changes overtime. Statistical significance was determined as  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05$  . All  analyses were performed with SAS 14.2(SAS Institute, Cary NC).  

# RESULTS  

Approximately 5.8 million enrollees, including 20,554 index strokes(5,198 in young adults  <55) were identified(Table). Half of all strokes  $(50.4\%)$   occurred in women. The average age  for both women and men with index stroke was approximately 63 years(SD 13.8). The index  stroke rate increased with age in both men and women.  

As shown in the Figure, the IRR indicated more strokes among women than men(i.e. <1) in  the youngest age group(15-24), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The  IRR indicated more strokes among women in both the 25-34 and 35-44 year age groups. In  the next three older age groups(45-54, 55-64, and 65-74), the trend reverses with more  strokes among men. The sex differences disappear for patients   $\Sigma/5$   years.  

The IRR varied across the age groups(Supplemental Table I). The IRR in the younger age  groups for each 2-year interval, were not statistically different. In contrast, the IRRs for the  2-year intervals between the 45-74 year age groups are statistically significant, with men  consistently having more strokes. Statistically significant temporal trends in IRR were not  detected in any age group.  

# DISCUSSION  

In this large, retrospective cohort of insured Americans, strokes occurred more often in  young women ages 25-44 years than in young men. This is the first study to our knowledge  to report higher stroke rates among young women in the U.S. Previous studies in the U.S.  using the National Inpatient Sample found that young men ages 15-44 had higher stroke  hospitalization rates than young women.  One possible explanation for this discrepancy is  that the denominator in the prior study was the number of inpatient admissions, which may  underestimate the true incidence. Young women, in general, have more hospitalizations than  men due to child bearing, thereby diluting stroke hospitalization rates in women. In contrast,  the European 15 Cities Young Stroke Study found a female predominance among those  younger than age 34 years by a male to female ratio of 0.7, meaning  $30\%$   more strokes  occurred in young women. Moreover, compared to men, women had strokes at a younger  age with fewer vascular risk factors. Unfortunately, this study did not have a reliable  population size in which to calculate an incidence and IRR. Most recently, a Dutch study  estimated the incidence of strokes among young adults using a nationwide cohort and found  more strokes among young women, ages 18-44. The IRR of ischemic stroke in women  compared to men declined with age from 2.04 in ages 18-24 to 1.20 in ages 40-44. These  results are consistent with our findings.  

There are many potential hypotheses regarding the higher incidence of stroke among young  women. Endogenous estrogen may serve a preventative role for cardiovascular events in premenopausal women.  This is true for acute myocardial infarction, where incidence is much  lower in young women.  However, we found the opposite for ischemic strokes. With the  exception of obesity, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors are higher among young  men in the U.S.  Hence, there may be non-cardiovascular risk factors, which are unique or  more prevalent in women, leading to strokes. Some possible explanations include pregnancy,  oral contraception, and other female-predominant risk factors including migraine headaches  and autoimmune disorders.  A better understanding of the etiologies and risk factors of  strokes in young women is needed in future research and an important step towards  prevention.  

There are some limitations to this study. First, our study sample was drawn from an  administrative, commercial database. Few Medicaid and Medicare patients were included  and uninsured and self-pay patients are not included. Second, we were unable to study race  or ethnicity using this database. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of stroke in  young adults is higher among Blacks and Hispanics and future studies examining race/ ethnicity differences by age and sex are warranted.  Last, due to the administrative nature  of this dataset, we do not know the etiology of ischemic stroke nor its severity. Future work  linking administrative to clinical data would provide a fuller understanding.  

# CONCLUSION  

We found that stroke incidence is higher in young women than young men, suggesting the  importance of sex-mediated risk factors. Understanding these factors is critical to stroke  treatment and prevention efforts in young adults.
