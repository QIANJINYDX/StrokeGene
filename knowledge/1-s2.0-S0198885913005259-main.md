Interferon s (IFNs) play key roles in various biologic responses including antiviral and immune reactions. e

 (IFNE).  

We recruited stroke [119 ischemic stroke (IS) and 145 intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH)] and control

 (401), respectively. The nonsense SNP (rs2039381, Gln71Stop) of IFNE was selected. We identiﬁed individual genotype using sequencing. SNPStats and SPSS 18.0 programs were used to analyze genetic data. Genotype frequencies   $\scriptstyle\left(C/C:C/\mathrm{T}:\mathrm{T}/\mathrm{T}\right)$   in the ICH group and control group were 59.3:37.9:2.8 and

 73.6:23.4:3.0, respectively. We found that rs2039381 was associated with ICH   $.0\mathtt{R}=2.01$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}=1.33\!-\!3.03$  ,  $p=0.001$   in co dominant 1 model;   $0\mathsf{R}=1.91$  ,   $95\%~{\mathsf{C I}}=1.28–2.84$  ,  $p=0.0016$   in dominant model;  $\mathrm{OR}=1.60$  ,   $95\%$     ${\mathsf{C I}}=1.14{-}2.26$  ,  $p=0.0074$  in log-additive model). T allele frequency of rs2039381 was sign i cant ly higher in ICH than in controls. The nonsense SNP (rs2039381, Gln71Stop) of IFNE was associated with ICH (  $,\mathrm{OR}=1.61$  ,  $95\%$   ${\mathsf{C I}}=1.14{-}2.26$  ,    $p=0.006.$  ).  

A nonsense SNP (rs2039381, Gln71Stop) of IFNE was associated with ICH in Korean population.

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke is a major cause death and serious disability. It suddenly occurs when blood vessel in the brain bursts. Types of stroke are divided ischemic stroke (IS), intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and sub ara ch noid hemorrhage (SAH). The IS is the most common type of stroke accounting for about 80 percent of stroke patients and caused by a blood clot within an artery leading to the brain. ICH is caused by the sudden rupture of an artery within the brain.  

Stroke is inﬂuenced by environmental and genetic factors. In recent association studies, accumulating evidences indicate that polymorphisms of genetic factors inﬂuence the risk of stroke. The role of in amma tory cytokines in the pathogen es is of stroke has been emphasized, and polymorphisms in some in amma tory genes, including interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), IL6, and   $\mathrm{IL}1\upbeta$  , are associated with increased risk factors for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke  [1–3] . Polymorphism of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member 5 (CD40) also showed association with development of IS  [4] .  

Interferon s (IFNs) play key roles in various biologic responses such as homeostasis, host defense, and innate immunity  [5] . IFN-gamma (IFNG), which is also a Type II IFN, was reported to be regulating stroke-induced immune reaction of   $\mathrm{{CD8+T}}$   cells [6] . Type I IFNs also have major roles in the innate immune responses and roles of Type I IFNs in cytotoxic immune pathway may control immune responses in inﬂamed central nervous system [7] . Moreover, stroke induces cytotoxic brain edema from its early hypoxic stage  [8] . Therefore, Type I IFNs may be play a role in the brain of stroke lesion. IFNe  (IFNE) belongs to Type I IFNs. IFNE is expressed in many tissues including the brain, coronary smooth muscle endo the li al cells, and micro vascular endo the li al cells. Previous study has shown that IFNE mediates TNF-alpha-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, 91 kDa (STAT1) phosphor yl ation [9] . However, its biochemical and biologic characteristics still remain largely undeﬁned and IFNE did not be investigated relationship with stroke. Considering the high mortality and morbidity of stroke, the discovery of a genetic marker for the stroke development would be valuable.  

In this study, we tested an association between a nonsense polymorphism (rs2039381, Gln71Stop) of IFNE and IS or ICH stroke in Korean population.  

# 2. Subjects and methods  

We examined whether a nonsense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2039381, Gln71Stop) of IFNE was associated with IS and intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH). All participants who suffer stroke were recruited with patients of the Stroke Center of the East–West Neo-Medical Center and the emergency department of Kyung Hee Medical Center (Seoul, Republic of Korea). One hundred and nineteen IS patients   $'65.1\pm11.9$   years; mean  $\pm\,S\mathsf{D}$  ) and 145 ICH patients   $.58.2\pm12.6$   years) were enrolled. Patients having other causes of cerebro vascular events including stroke from trauma, vascular malformation, brain tumors, and congenital brain disorders were excluded. Each patient underwent cranial CT, MRI, angiography, and duplex sonography. The control subjects for stroke   $'n=401$  ,   $53.6\pm15.3$   years) were selected among the participants in a general health check-up program and none of them had any clinical evidences of IS, ICH, transient ischemic attack, ischemic heart diseases, or any other severe diseases. This study was approved by the ethics review committee of the Medical Research Institute, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University. Informed consent was obtained from each patient or guardian.  

We searched for SNPs of IFNE using the online SNP database ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /SNP, dbSNP BUILD 135) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and then selected a nonsense SNP (rs2039381, Gln71Stop). The genotype of rs2039381 was evaluated by direct sequencing. Genomic DNA was ampliﬁed using the following primers for rs2039381 (sense,  $5^{\prime}$  -CAT TC ACT A GAG CT GG A AT TTC CC $.3^{\prime}$  ; antisense,   $5^{\prime}$  -CCAGGTAATCAT GG AT CC TTC GG $.3^{\prime}$  ). PCR conditions were followings: 30 cycles of  $94\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 s,  $58\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,s,$  , and  $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\,s$   and 1 cycle of  $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 5 min to terminate the reaction. PCR products were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3730XL analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence data were analyzed using SeqManII software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA).  

SNPStats ( http://bioinfo.icon co logia.net/index.php?module= Snpstats ) and SPSS 18.0 were used to analyze genetic data. Multiple logistic regression models (co dominant 1, co dominant 2, dominant, and recessive models) were performed to determine odds ratios (OR),   $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CI), and  $p$   values. Sample power was calculated to verify our data ( http://pngu.mgh. harvard.edu/\~purcell/gpc/cc2.html ).  

# 3. Results  

The  Table 1  presents genotype and allele distributions of rs2039381 among ICH, IS, and control subjects. No deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium were found in the control group  $\AA{p>0.05}$  , data not shown). Genetic analysis was performed by logistic regression analysis. In  Table 2 , genotype frequencies

  $\scriptstyle\left({\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}:{\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{T}}:{\mathsf{T}}/{\mathsf{T}}\right)$  in the ICH group and control group were

 59.3:37.9:2.8 and 73.6:23.4:3.0, respectively. In codominant1 model (C/C genotype vs  $\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T}$   genotype),   $\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T}$   genotype frequencies were sign i cant ly different between the ICH and control groups  $.0\mathtt{R}=2.01$  ,   $95\%$     ${\mathsf{C I}}=1.33–3.03$  ,  $p=0.001$  ). In dominant model   $(\mathsf{C}I$  C genotype vs   $\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T}$   and   $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotypes),   $\mathsf{C}/\mathrm{T}$   and   $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotypes frequencies were sign i cant ly different between the ICH and control groups   $[0\mathsf{R}=1.91\$  ,  $95\%\;{\sf C I}=1.28–2.84.$  ,  $p=0.0016$   in dominant model). In log-additive model   ${\mathsf{\Delta}}({\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   genotype vs C/T genotype

However, genotype and allele distributions of rs2039381 were not different between the IS and control groups ( Table 3 ).  

We calculated sample power to verify our data ( http:// pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/\~purcell/gpc/cc2.html ). In this study, the sample power of the SNP rs203938 was 0.8148 (alpha level  $=0.05$  , the number of cases for   $80\%$   power  $=109$  ). Although the sample

# 4. Discussion  

IFNE is constitutive ly expressed in many tissues including the brain, coronary smooth muscle endo the li al cells, and microvascular endo the li al cells  [10] . Similar to other Type I IFNs, IFNE is induced by many factors such as pro in f amma tory cytokines and viruses, and the biologic activities of IFNE which act through Type I IFN receptors  [5] . IFNE is involved in maintenance of the structure and function of the brain  [11] . The hyaluronic acid-mediated motility receptor which is regulated by IFNE is also involved in the formation of brain micro vessels  [12] .  

IFNE is located on chromosome 9p21.3, close to other Type I IFNs cluster such as IFNA and IFNW. The IFNE protein (Q86WN2, UniProt ID) consists of 208 amino acids. Amino acids from 1 to 21 constitute the signal peptide and the rest of amino acids from 22 to 208 constitute the IFNE chain ( http://www.uniprot.org ). The change in sequence (from C to T) of rs2039381 results in a truncation of the amino acid chain (from Gln to Stop). In Europeans, the genotype of rs2039381 is mono m orphic (  $100\%\textsf{C}/\mathsf{C}$   genotype). However, the   ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}},\;{\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{T}}$  , and   $\mathrm{T/T}$   frequencies of rs2039381 are 0.689, 0.267, and 0.044 in Chinese; 0.667, 0.333, and 0.000 in Japanese; and 0.900, 0.100, and 0.000 in sub-Saharan Africans, respectively ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /SNP, dbSNP BUILD 135). The  ${\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{C}},{\mathsf{C}}/{\mathsf{T}}$  , and  $\mathrm{T/T}$   frequencies in the Korean in our study were 0.736, 0.234, and 0.030, respectively. Therefore, ethnic differences are shown in this nonsense SNP. The incidence of ICH per 100,000 person-years was 24.2 in Whites, 22.9 in Blacks, 19.6 in Hispanics, and 51.8 in Asians between 1980 and 2008. The high incidence of ICH in Asians presents an interesting medical puzzle. Considering the existence of the T allele of rs2039381 (Gln71Stop) in Asians, but not in Europeans, we propose that the T allele of rs2039381 may be a risk factor for the development of ICH in Asians.  

A few studies have reported the role of nonsense SNPs in several pathological conditions or diseases. The Arg67Stop of protein Zdependent protease inhibitor ( ZPI, SERPINA10 ) increases the risk for venous thrombosis  [13] . A stop codon polymorphism of toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) is associated with resistance to systemic lupus erythematosus  [14] . The nonsense polymorphism (Trp149Stop) of ADP-rib o syl ation factor-like 11 ( ARLTS1 ,  ARL11 ) is associated with familial cancer  [15] . Additionally, some studies have found an association between certain genes and ICH  [16–18] . The exact biologic function in stroke of SNP rs2039381 is still unknown. It is a fact known that the change in sequence (from C to T) of rs2039381 results in a truncation of the amino acid chain from Glutamine acid to stop. It could be a cause of genetic diseases including complex diseases and may be to lead to expression of non functional or deleterious truncated proteins  [19] .  

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is ﬁrst study to examine the association between the IFNE nonsense polymorphism (rs2039381, Gln71Stop) and the risk of stroke.  

In conclusion, we found that the nonsense polymorphism (rs2039381, Gln71Stop) of IFNE was associated with ICH, but not with IS, in Korean population. The T allele of rs2039381 was also related to the development of ICH. Further studies with more samples and different population will be needed.
