# Abstract  

The rs9958947 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) resides in the promoter region of the lipase G ( LIPG ) gene. This newly  discovered SNP increases the risk of stroke in some Asian populations, including Chinese and Korean populations. Stroke  is one of the top 5 leading causes of death in Malaysia, so it is of interest to investigate whether this SNP is associated with  stroke risk in the Malaysian population. Therefore, this study investigates this association through a case–control study on a  Malaysian population along with a comprehensive meta-analysis. Genotyping of  $L I P G\;\mathrm{{rs9958947}\;\mathrm{{SNP}}}$   was performed for  241 Malaysians using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the odds ratios (OR) with   $95\%$   confidence intervals were calculated. The meta-analysis was conducted using the software Comprehensive Meta-Analysis ver. 2.2.064. A  $p$   value less than  0.05 was considered statistically significant. We observed that the mean age of Malaysian stroke patients was less than that of  stroke patients from Korea and China. The meta-analysis showed that the   $L I P G\,\mathrm{{rs9958947}\,\mathrm{{SNP}}}$   was significantly associated  with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in Asian populations (dominant (CC vs.   $\mathrm{CT+TT}$  :  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.45$  ,  $p\!<\!0.001$  ; allelic  (C vs. T):  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.21$  ,  $p\!=\!0.001$  ; heterozygous (CC vs. CT):  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.47$  ,  $p\!<\!0.001$  , and homozygous (CC vs. TT):  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.46$  ,   $p\!=\!0.047)$  ). However, there was no evidence to associate this SNP with stroke risk in the Malaysian population (overall CC  vs. CT:  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.04$  , CC vs. TT:  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.25$  , CC vs.  $\mathrm{CT+TT}$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.13$  ; all  $p\!>\!0.05)$  ) and blood lipid levels.

# Introduction  

Stroke is among the major causes of death and disability in  many countries. Globally, there are nearly 25.7 million stroke  survivors, 6.5 million deaths due to stroke, 113 million disability-adjusted life-years lost due to stroke, and 10.3 million new  cases of stroke as of 2013 (Feigin et al.  2015 ). It was reported  that Asian countries have a higher stroke mortality rate than  Western Europe and American countries except for some countries such as Japan (Feigin et al.  2014 ). In Malaysia, stroke was  listed as the third cause of death in both males and females in  2018 (Department of Statistics Malaysia  2019 ).  

In general, stroke can be divided into two main types:  ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS). IS occurs  when blood clots form and consequently block the flow of  nutrient- and oxygen-rich blood in the supplying artery of a  brain region. About  $87\%$   of strokes are IS (Moz za far ian et al.  2016 ). HS occurs when a weakened blood vessel in the brain  ruptures, which causes blood to leak into the brain and stops  the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. High blood  pressure and aneurysms are some of the conditions that can  cause HS (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention  2017 ).  

Studies have confirmed that a decrease in the level of  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a precise  and controllable risk factor for at hero sclerotic diseases such  as stroke and coronary heart diseases (Linsel-Nitsehke and  Tall  2005 ; Otokozawa et al.  2010 ; Zeljkovic et al.  2010 ). The  enzyme lipase G (LIPG) is known to regulate the metabolism of HDL-C, and common variants in the  LIPG  gene have  been proposed to affect the plasma levels of HDL-C (Wilier  et al.  2008 ). The  LIPG  gene mapped at chromosome 18q21.1  encodes endo the li al lipase (EL/LIPG), which is a conserved  plasma ph os ph o lipase expressed by endo the li al cells (Jaye  et al.  1999 ). EL has the greatest lipid phosphatase activity  among the triglyceride lipase family and is unique due to its  expression by vascular endo the li al cells and the up-regulation  of its expression by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF $\cdot{\bf\alpha}$    and IL-  $1\upbeta$   (Jin et al.  2003 ; Mank-Seymour et al.  2004 ).  

Many studies have investigated the relationship between  the common variants of the  LIPG  gene and the level of  HDL-C in related diseases, including stroke, but the results  remain controversial (Edmondson et al.  2009 ; Ishida et al.  2003 ; Jensen et al.  2009 ; Mank-Seymour et al.  2004 ; Vergeer  et al.  2010 ). The present study focuses on the rs9958947 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the  LIPG  gene. This  SNP was selected since it is located in the promoter region of  the  LIPG  gene, which may directly affect the expression of  this gene and the regulation of blood lipid levels, which are  highly related to stroke. This study also pooled the results with  similar studies to establish a comprehensive meta-analysis to  draw a firm conclusion about the relationship between  LIPG   rs9958947 SNP and stroke risk.  

# Methods  

# Study Subjects  

Blood samples from 103 confirmed stroke survivors were collected from Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Sabah, Malaysia, in the  period of 2016 to 2017. The stroke subtype of the patients was  verified by a certified neurologist using a magnetic resonance  imaging approach. Blood from 138 age-matched healthy volunteers who did not have a stroke history were also collected.  Written consent including the information about the age,  gender, ethnicity, and lifestyle habits (i.e., smoking status,  alcohol consumption) of both the stroke patients and healthy  controls were obtained. The study subjects were not ethnic-and gender-matched since the blood samples were randomly  collected and not targeted to a specific ethnic or gender group.  

# DNA Extraction and Genotyping  

DNA from the peripheral blood was extracted using the salting-out method as previously described (Phneh et al.  2019 ).  The extracted DNA was used as a template for a real-time  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping analysis. In  brief, a PCR mixture containing approximately   $100{-}200\;\mathrm{ng}$    of genomic DNA,  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of 5X HOT FIREPol  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   Probe Universal qPCR Mix (Solis BioDyne, Tartu, Estonia), and  $0.5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of  20X TaqMan  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   genotyping assay (assay ID: C 1519461 20)  (ABI, USA) was prepared. The amplification protocol was set  with the following adjustment: preheating at   $60\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30~\mathrm{s}$  ,  de natura tion at  $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\;\mathrm{{min}}$  , 40 cycles of de natura tion  at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $18~\mathrm{s}$  , and annealing and extension at  $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\;\mathrm{{min}}$  . The genotyping was carried out using the StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (ABI, USA), and the results  were analyzed using TaqMan  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   Genotyper Software ver.1.3  (ABI, USA).  

# Blood Lipid Profiles  

A total of 53 patients of IS were available to determine their  blood lipid levels, including triglyceride levels, cholesterol levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The analyses were grouped based on the genotype, and the corresponding  blood lipid levels were calculated for each one. In addition, the  mean differences of blood lipid levels in the dominant model  (CC vs.  $\mathrm{CT+TT}$  ) and recessive model (TT vs.   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{CC+CT}$   were  compared using an independent   $t$   test. SPSS software ver. 17.0  (IBM, USA) was used for the statistical analysis.  

# Meta‑Analysis  

An extensive literature search was performed on both PubMed  and Google Scholar without language restrictions for studies  reporting the association of  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP with stroke  risk until June 30, 2020. Search terms such as “lipase G,”  “rs9958947,” and “ LIPG  rs9958947” alone or in combination  with “stroke,” “cerebro vascular accident,” “cva,” and the equivalent were used. The titles and abstracts of potential articles were  screened to determine replications of studies. The full texts of  the remaining articles were assessed to verify the relevance of  the contained information regarding the topic of interest.  

The criteria for eligible studies are as follows: (i) original  papers based on a case–control design assessing the association between  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP and stroke risk, (ii) suf- ficient data for the calculation of the genotypic odds ratio  (OR) with the corresponding   $95\%$   confidence interval   $95\%$    CI), and (iii) the involvement of only patients with stroke and  its subtypes, such as IS, HS, and lacunar infarction. If studies included overlapping data, the most recent and complete  studies were chosen. The titles, abstracts, and full texts of all  the retrieved articles were screened carefully by following the  inclusion criteria stated. Data about first author’s name, year of  publication, population studied, number of cases and controls,  genotyping method, and genotype frequency were extracted.  

# Statistical Analyses  

In the case–control study, Pearson’s chi-squared test was used  to determine the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in both  cases and controls. The association of  $L I P G r s9958947\,\mathrm{S}$  NP with  stroke risk was accessed by the OR with  $95\%$   CI using SPSS  software ver.17.0 (IBM, USA). The association was considered  statistically significant when the  $p$   value was less than 0.05.  

In the meta-analysis, five genetic comparison models were  considered: dominant (CC vs.   $\mathrm{CT}\!+\!\mathrm{TT})$  , recessive (TT vs.   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{CC}+\mathrm{CT})$  , allelic (C vs. T), heterozygous (CC vs. CT), and  homozygous (CC vs. TT). The  $I^{2}$   method and   $Q$  -statistic test  were used to assess the heterogeneity among studies (Higgins  and Thompson  2002 ). A random-effects model (REM) was  adopted as a pooling method if substantial heterogeneity was  present   $(I^{2}\!>\!50\%)$  ; otherwise, a fixed-effects model (FEM) was  selected as the pooling method (Der Simoni an and Laird  1986 ;  Higgins et al.  2003 ; Mantel and Haenszel  1959 ). Publication  bias was assessed using funnel plots, Egger’s linear regression  test, and Begg’s test (Begg and Majumdar  1994 ; Egger et al.  1997 ). Comprehensive Meta-Analysis ver. 2.2.064 (Biostats,  Inc., USA) was used to perform the meta-analysis. The reported  probabilities   $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{p}}$   values) were two-sided, and a  $p$   value  $_{<0.05}$   was  considered as statistically significant.  

# Results  

# Association of  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP and Stroke Risk  in the Case–Control Study  

Table  1  shows the demographic characteristics of stroke  patients and controls in this study. The case–control  study comprised 103 stroke patients where 58 were  IS cases and 45 were HS cases. The mean age of the

stroke patients was   $53.53\pm12.72$   years, while that of the  healthy controls was  $55.51\pm14.62$   years. No significant  difference was found between the age of stroke patients  and controls (  $\mathit{\check{p}}\!=\!0.275)$  ). Hence, the case–control samples

are age-matched. The genotype distribution in both cases  and controls was in HWE (cases: chi-squared  $=0.30$  ,   $p\!=\!0.584$  ; controls: chi-squared  $=1.04$  ,  $p\!=\!0.308)$  . There  was no significant difference between the cases and controls with respect to genotypic   $\mathit{\check{p}}=0.773)$   and allelic   $(p\,{=}\,0.514)$   frequency distributions. There was a lack of  association between  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP and stroke  risk in this Malaysian population, even after stratification for stroke subtype, gender, and lifestyle (Table  2 ).  

# Genotyping of  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP and Blood Lipid  Levels  

There were no significant differences among the genotypes  in  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP in the mean blood lipid levels,  including triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDLC. Furthermore, there was no difference in blood lipid levels  in the comparison of both dominant and recessive models  (Table  3 ).  

# Association of  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP and Stroke Risk  in the Meta‑Analysis  

After the selection process, a total of four eligible studies  (including the present study) were recruited in the metaanalysis (Fig.  1 ), which consisted of a total of 1281 cases  and 1232 controls. Since the three other studies recruited  only IS cases, the present study pooled only IS cases   $(N\!=\!58)$  ) in the meta-analysis. All the studies included in  the meta-analysis involved Asian populations (Koreans,  Chinese, and Malaysians) due to insufficient studies on  non-Asian populations (Table  4 ). Overall, there was a significant association between  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP and an  increased IS risk in all the comparison models except for  the recessive model (Fig.  2 ; Table  5 ). The funnel plots,  Egger’s test, and Begg’s test revealed that there was no significant publication bias in any of the comparison models  of the meta-analysis (Fig.  3 ).  

# Discussion  

Stroke risk has been reported to increase with age, doubling  with each decade after the age of 45 years, and over  $70\%$   of  all strokes occur above the age of 65 (Kelly-Hayes  2010 ).  In this study, the mean age for the stroke patients was  53.53 years. The young age of stroke patients in the present  study is supported by a previous stroke research in Malaysia, where the mean age of stroke onset in Malaysians was  as early as 50 years (Cheah et al.  2016 ). In addition, the  mean age of stroke patients in this study is eight and fifteen  years earlier than the mean age of stroke patients in a study  conducted on a Chinese population and Korean population,  respectively (Kim et al.  2012 ; Wang et al.  2014 ). This is an  alarming circumstance, and serious awareness is needed for  all Malaysians to take on preventive action, such as regular  exercise and a healthy diet from a younger age.  

Recently, a METASTROKE collaboration was established with the aim to combine and analyze the available  genome-wide association studies datasets of IS, and the  study concluded that risk association of SNP was specific  to a stroke subtype and different path o physiological mechanisms are associated with different stroke subtypes (Traylor et al.  2012 ). Therefore, it is interesting to investigate  whether the  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP is associated with stroke  risk in the Malaysian population since significant associations have been reported for several Asian populations,  including Korean and Chinese populations. In the present  study, no significant association was found between  LIPG rs9958947 SNP and stroke risk in the Malaysian population. Further analysis after stratification based on stroke  subtype also revealed no significant association between  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP and stroke subtypes (IS and HS)  in the Malaysian population. However, previous studies  on Chinese and Korean populations have demonstrated  a significant association between the T allele of  LIPG rs9958947 SNP and increased IS risk (Du et al.  2013 ; Kim  et al.  2012 ; Wang et al.  2014 ). This result may be due to  the fact that unlike the Chinese and Korean populations,

the Malaysian population consisted of multiple ethnicities (i.e. Malay, Malaysian Chinese, Malaysian Indian,  Kada zand u sun, Bajau, Rungus, Iban, etc.). This implies  that the association between this SNP and stroke risk may  occur in an ethnic-specific manner.  

There is a lack of studies addressing the prevalence of  stroke among different ethnic groups in Malaysia. However, cerebro vascular diseases (such as stroke) were found  to cause   $8.3\%$   of total deaths in Malays, Kada zand u sun,  etc.,   $7.2\%$   in Malaysian Chinese, and only  $6.1\%$   in Malaysian Indians in 2018 (Department of Statistics Malaysia

2019 ). A study on a Singaporean population, which also  consists of multiple ethnicities, showed that stroke prevalence was highest among Singaporean Chinese men and  lowest among Singaporean Malay women (Ven ket a sub ramanian et al.  2005 ). Therefore, these findings suggest that  differences in ethnicity may somehow affect the prevalence  of stroke, and further research is needed to confirm this.  

A recent human genome-wide association study discovered that common sequence variants in the  LIPG  gene can  directly affect HDL-C levels, and reduced plasma HDL-C  levels are a well-known risk factor for at hero sclerotic diseases such as IS (Linsel-Nitsehke and Tall  2005 ; Ma et al.  2010 ). The LIPG protein is responsible for the metabolism  of HDL through the hydrolysis of HDL. LIPG cleaves lipoproteins such as HDL, releasing the free fatty acid lipid  precursor which can be then uptake by the cells and incorporate into endogenous lipids (Yu et al.  2018 ). Studies had  shown that the expression of   $L I P G$   is inversely correlated  with plasma levels of HDL-C where  LIPG  knockout mice  have been shown to have increased HDL-C level in the blood  (Jaye et al.  1999 ; Ishida et al.  2003 ). To date, there are limited  data on the influence of  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP on blood lipid  parameters. In the present study, blood samples from the IS  patients were used to perform blood lipid analysis to determine the association of  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP with various  blood lipid parameters. The results showed that the levels of  various blood lipid parameters were not influenced by the  genotypes in the  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP.  

A similar result was obtained by Kim et al ( 2012 ), where  the HDL-C level was not influenced by the  LIPG  rs9958947  SNP in a population of more than 1000 Koreans. Nevertheless, the T allele of this SNP was associated with a higher  cholesterol level and a lower HDL-C level in a Chinese  population consisting of nearly 800 subjects (Wang et al.  2014 ). This phenomenon may be caused by differences in  diet or heterogeneity in the population studied as the Malaysian population consists of multiple ethnicities, while the  studied Chinese population consisted of only Han Chinese.  Furthermore, the highly modifiable nature of the HDL-C  level may also contribute to this situation.  

Another study showed that HDL-C levels are modifiable  through environmental factors, including physical activities,  alcohol consumption, smoking, and diet (Ellison et al.  2004 ).  It was reported that physical activities are associated with an  increase in HDL-C levels, and vice versa (Schmidt et al.  2008 ).  Furthermore, individual HDL-C responses to physical activities are highly variable (Halve r stadt et al.  2007 ). Therefore, the  HDL-C level in the body may not be solely influenced by the  genetic variation of the  LIPG  gene, but environmental factors  such as physical activities could also influence the HDL-C  level. Interestingly, Kim et al. ( 2012 ) suggested that the  LIPG rs9958947 SNP may be linked with another genetic alteration  that affects the prevalence of stroke through a mechanism other  than plasma lipid metabolism that is yet to be discovered.  

IS represents about   $87\%$   of all stroke incidences, and the  other three studies involved only IS cases. Thus, the present  study pooled only IS cases   $(N{=}58)$  ) in the meta-analysis.  LIPG   rs9958947 SNP was associated with an increased IS risk in  all the comparison models in the meta-analysis except for the  recessive model. It was also found that the T allele of the  LIPG   rs9958947 SNP significantly increased the risk of IS by nearly   $50\%$   in the dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous models  and by more than  $20\%$   in the allelic model. This implies that  although  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP may not influence the plasma  lipid level, it remains significantly associated with stroke  through mechanisms other than the plasma lipid metabolism.  To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis reporting the  association between  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP and stroke risk.  

There are several limitations in the present study that  should be clarified. In the case–control study, there was a  lack of confounding factor analyses (e.g., smoking, diet),  and the expression level of LIPG enzymes was not evaluated in accordance with  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP. Besides that,  the study presented a considerable degree of heterogeneity,  due to the inclusion of different ethnicities and the lack of  gender-matching. Although a precise search strategy was set  for the retrieval of eligible studies in the meta-analysis, we  could not eliminate the possibilities that some studies published in other databases were not included. In the meta-analysis, we focused on only the genetic aspects, while gender,

environmental, and lifestyle factors were not included due to  data limitation. The meta-analysis could have also been more  robust if additional inheritance models were added.  

# Conclusion  

In conclusion, this study observed that the mean age of  Malaysian stroke patients is less than that of other Asian  populations. The meta-analysis showed that there is a  significant association between the  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP  and an increased risk of IS risk in Asian populations,  but there is a lack of evidence to associate this SNP with  stroke risk in the Malaysian population and blood lipid  levels. Data from other Asian and non-Asian populations  are needed to further validate  LIPG  rs9958947 SNP as  a diagnostic genetic marker for stroke risk evaluation.
