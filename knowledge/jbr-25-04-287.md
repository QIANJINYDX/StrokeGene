# Abstract  

The aim of present study was to investigate the relationship between nerve injury - induced protein 2 ( NINJ2 )  gene polymorphism and stroke in Chinese Han population. Fifty - two patients with large - artery atherosclerosis  (LAA) infarction, 85 patients with small - artery occlusion lacunar (SAO) infarction, 50 patients with intra cerebral  hemorrhage (ICH) and 66 controls were included. Genotypes and alleles frequencies of the two single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) of  NINJ2  among different groups were analyzed and compared. In regard to  rs12425791 ,  the frequencies of the  $A G$   and  $_{A A+A G}$   genotypes of the LAA and SAO groups were significantly higher than those  in the control group; the frequency of the   $A$   allele of the SAO group was significantly higher than that of the con - trol group. In regard to  rs11833579 , there were not any significant differences between the case and the control  groups. The SNP  rs12425791  is significantly associated with ischemic stroke, and the  $A$   allele increases the sus - ce pti bil it y to stroke. The SNP  rs11833579  is not significantly associated with stroke.  

Keywords:  nerve injury - induced protein 2 (NINJ2), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), stroke, cell adhesion  molecule  

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is a disease with high prevalence, and is es - pecially notable for its high mortality and disability  rate, inflicting a heavy socioeconomic burden. Many  risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipi - demia, smoking and heart disease have been identified  nowadays, but the genetic background of stroke still  remains unclear.  

A prospective cohort study found that two single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the nerve injury - induced protein 2 ( NINJ2 ) gene were significantly  associated with stroke, and the two minor alleles of  this gene increased the susceptibility to stroke, espe - cially to the at hero sclerotic thrombotic subtype . The  two SNPs were close to the 5 ’  end of the  NINJ2  gene,  indicating that  NINJ2  may play an important role in  stroke. But the study was only carried out in the Cau - casian and Black population, while the relationship  between the two SNPs and stroke in other populations  is still unknown. Heve, we carried out a case - control  study to investigate the relationship between the two  SNPs and stroke in Chinese Han population. Fifty - two patients with large - artery atherosclerosis (LAA)  infarction, 85 patients with small - artery occlusion la - cunar (SAO) infarction, 50 patients with intra cerebral  hemorrhage (ICH) and 66 controls were included in  

this study. Genotypes of the two SNP sites among  different groups were determined by PCR - restriction  fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Subjects  

All the cases of this study were patients with stroke  admitted to the Neurology Department of Nanjing  Brain Hospital from 2009 to 2010, they were all Han  Chinese, and were classified into four groups: 52 pa - tients with LAA and 85 patients with SAO accord - ing to the TOAST typing, 50 patients with ICH, and  66 healthy people as control. The inclusion criteria  were as followes: all the subjects of case groups were  50 to 80 years old, either male or female, with new - onset or recurrent stroke. The diagnoses were based  on clinical history, physical examination and CT or  MRI imaging. The subjects of the control group were  healthy people of the same age range, without stroke  history or abnormality of MRI imaging, either male  or female. The exclusion criteria for the LAA and  SAO group were as follows: patients with cardiac  thrombotic cerebral infarction, watershed cerebral  infarction, cerebral infarction caused by infective or  immunological arteritis, atrial fibrillation, severe he - patic or nephritic dysfunction, cancer, autoimmune  disease and hyper coa gul ability caused by hemato - logical disease or drugs should be excluded; for the  ICH group, patients with sub ara ch noid hemorrhage,  traumatic intra cranial hemorrhage, intra cranial he - morrhage after infarction, severe hepatic or nephritic  dysfunction, cancer, autoimmune disease and coagu - lation dysfunction caused by hematological disease or  drugs should be excluded. The following data of all  the subjects were recorded: gender, age, height and  weight, body mass index (BMI), history of smoking,  alcohol, hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, the  levels of trig lye ride (TG), cholesterol (CHO), high  density lipoprotein (HDL),  low density lipoprotein 

 (LDL), apo lipoprotein A (apoA), apo lipoprotein B 

 (apoB), and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] ( Table 1 ). All the  study participants provided informed consents.

# SNP selection and genotyping  

Five mL venous blood samples were drawn from  all the subjects after fasting for at least   $^{\textrm{8h}}$  . Genomic  DNA was extracted (TIANamp, Tiangen).The prim - ers were synthesized by Sangong Bio engineer Ltd,  Shanghai. The sequences of primers for  rs12425791  were: forward   $_5,$  - G GC GAG CT GC T GC TTT TAG -  $_{\cdot3},$  ,  reverse   $_5\mathrm{{}}^{\circ}$  - T GTC A GAG GAGA A ACCA GG AAC -  $_{\cdot3},$  ;  for  rs11833579 : forward   $_5\mathrm{{}}^{\circ}$  - AG GT GG GAG GAT T - GCTTG -  $_{\cdot3}^{\cdot}$  , reverse   $_5'$  - TTT CCC T CTA TTC A GCC A - GAT - 3 ’ . The premix   $2\times$  Taq  PCR master mix (Bioed - ify, Nanjing, China) was used in the PCR assay.  The assay mix of rs12425791 contained in a volume  of   $50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  ,   $25~\upmu\mathrm{L}$     $2\times T a q$   PCR master mix,   $5~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   ge - nomic DNA and   $0.25~\upmu\mathrm{L}$     $(100\ \upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L})$   each primer;  the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: an  initial de natura tion at   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $5~\mathrm{min}$  , 35 cycles of   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}.$  ,   $55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}$  and   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}$  , and a  final extension at   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $5~\mathrm{min}$  . The assay mix of  rs11833579 contained in a volume of   $50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  ,   $25~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  

$2\times$  Taq  PCR master mix,   $3~{\upmu\mathrm{L}}$   genomic DNA and 0.10   $\upmu\mathrm{L}$     $(100\ \upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L})$   each primer; the thermal cycling  conditions were as follows: an initial de natura tion at   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $\mathrm{5~min}$  , 35 cycles of   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 s,   $58^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}$   and   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{s}$  , and a final extension at   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for   $\mathrm{5~min}$  . The amplification products were digested  by end on uc leases. The enzymes were commercially  supplied by Fermentas (Canada). The amplification  product of  rs12425791  were subjected to  Bsp L Ⅰ  di - gestion, allowing differentiation of the   $G G$   genotype  (164, 97 and   $17{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{top}}$  ), AA genotype (164 and   $115~\mathrm{top}$  )  and   $_{A G}$   genotype (164, 115, 97 and   $17{\mathrm{~}}{\mathrm{top}}$  ). The am - pli fi cation product of  rs12425791  was subjected to  Bfu Ⅰ  digestion, allowing differentiation of the   $_{G G}$  genotype (256 bp),  AA  genotype (169 and 87 bp) and   $_{A G}$    genotype (256, 169 and 87 bp) ( Fig. 1 ). The di - gested products were separated by PAGE and visual - ized by silver staining .

# Statistical analysis  

The background data of the subjects were compared  using   $\chi^{2}$  - test or variance analysis. Hardy - Weinberg  equilibrium was performed using goodness - of - fit  $\chi^{2}$  - test. The allele and genotype frequencies between the  case and control groups were compared using  $\chi^{2}$  - test  or Fisher exact test. Multi no mi al logistic regression  model was used to calculate the initial odds ratio   $(O R)$  of risk factors and genotypes, and   $95\%$   confidential  intervals   $(95\%C I)$   were given; if the   $P_{\l}$  - value of some  initial   $O R$   was less than 0.25, the corresponding risk  factors or genotypes would be subjected to the model  until all the   $P$    values   $<0.05$  , and the adjusted   $O R$   and   $95\%C I$   were given. A value of   $P<0.05$   was consid - ered as significant. All the statistical analyses were  performed using the Stata10.0 package.  

# RESULTS  

The genotype counts were in Hardy - Weinberg equi - librium in both the control and case groups at the two  polymorphic loci (  $P=0.15$   for the control group, 0.13  for the LAA group, 0.20 for the SAO group, 0.85 for  the ICH group).The genotype frequencies and allele  frequencies of the two SNPs in the different groups  were shown in  Table 2 . The genotype frequencies of  rs12425791  in the LAA group and the SAO group  were significantly different from that of the control  group, whereas these differences were not found in the  ICH group. The allele frequencies of  rs12425791  in  the SAO group were significantly different from those  of the control group. In regard to  rs11833579 , there  was not any significant difference in genotype or al - lele frequencies.  

Multi no mi al logistic regression was used to calcu - late the   $O R$   values of the genotypes of the two SNPs,  and the results are shown in  Table 3 . Before other risk  factors were adjusted, the   $A G$    and   $_{A A+A G}$    genotype  in the LAA group and SAO group were significantly  associated with stroke, while this was not found in the  ICH group. After adjustment of other risk factors such  as age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, TG, CHO,  LDL, HDL, apoA, apoB and Lp(a) the   $_{A G}$   genotype  of the LAA group and the   $_{A G}$   and  $_{A A+A G}$   genotypes  of the SAO group were still significantly associated  with stroke, while there was not significant association  between the   $_{A A+A G}$   genotype and stroke in the LAA  group after adjustment of other risk factors mentioned  above, the   $_{A G}$   and   $_{A A+A G}$   genotypes of the ICH  group were not significantly associated with stroke  even after adjustment other risk factors mentioned as  above. All genotypes of   $r s I242579I$   were not associ - ated with stroke, no matter before or after adjustment.

As the samples of the   $A A$   genotype of the two SNP  sites in all groups were relatively few, the  AA  geno - type was not subjected to multi no mi al logistic regres - sion analysis.  

# DISCUSSION  

The  NINJ  gene was first found in the study on the  gene expression of Schwann cell during peripheral  nerve regeneration, and then its homologue was subse - quently found . Thus, the original  NINJ  was renamed  the  NINJ1  genes, and its homologues was named the  NINJ2  gene. The molecules coded by the two genes  are membrane protein, which could mediate cell adhe - sion . Ninjurin plays an important role in the pe - ripheral nerve injury and regeneration process . The  two molecules can also promote axonal growth . So  far, no studies have shown an association between the  NINJ2  gene with stroke. The two SNPs in this study  are close to the   $_5\mathrm{{}}^{\circ}$    end of the  NINJ2  gene, indicating  that  NINJ2  may play an important role in stroke.  

Besides stroke, the  NINJ  gene was believed to play  an important role in many other neurological diseases,  such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer ’ s disease, lepro - sy, hereditary sensory neuropathy and Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease - . Possible mechanisms included  homologue assembly, Wnt signaling pathway, NF -  $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$    signaling pathway and P53 signaling pathway - .  

Our study showed that the minor allele ( A ) of SNP  rs12425791  in the Chinese Han population would in - crease the susceptibility to ischemic stroke. This was  the same as the conclusion from other studies on other  racial groups , indicating that the association be - tween SNP  rs12425791  and ischemic stroke might be  general in different races. This would help us further  explore the underlying mechanism of this association.  However, we failed to observe any association between  SNP  rs11833579  and stroke, which was contradictory  to previous report . We presumed that the association  between SNP rs11833579 and ischemic stroke may  be related to racial differences, because a previous  study also failed to find an association between SNP  rs11833579  and stroke in the Black population .  

The sample size of this study was relatively small,  and it is a case - control study limiting the conclusion  of the study . The study provided the preliminary data  on the genotype distribution of the two SNP loci in  Chinese Han population and the relationship between  them and stroke. Prospective studies with a larger  sample population are further being explored.  

In conclusion, the SNP  rs12425791  is signifi - cantly associated with ischemic stroke in Chinese  Han population, and the   $A$   allele increases the risk of  susceptibility to stroke. The SNP  rs11833579  is not  significantly associated with stroke in Chinese Han  population.
