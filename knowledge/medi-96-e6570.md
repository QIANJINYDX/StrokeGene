# Abstract  

Background:  Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a common chronic disorder which is followed by various complications.  Calpain-10  belongs to a commonly expressed member of the Calpain-like cysteine protease family, which acts as risk marker for some diseases. The purpose of this study is to elucidate correlation between  Calpain-10  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the incidence of OSAHS followed by ischemic stroke (IS).  

Methods:  OSAHS patients were divided as OSAHS+IS, OSAHS, and control groups, respectively. Immuno his to chemistry was performed for  Calpain-10  protein expression, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism for detection of gene polymorphisms of SNP 43 and SNP 19, and PCR-allele speci ﬁ c ampli ﬁ cation for SNP 44. Poly so mno graph y was conducted to check the nocturnal poly so mno graph y indicators, and also Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Scienti ﬁ c Data System scores cognition and anxiety of patients, respectively. Logistic analysis was used for the risky factors for OSAHS.  

Results:  Calpain-10  protein expression was signi ﬁ cantly increased in the  $\mathsf{O S A H S+I S}$   and OSAHS groups compared with the control group. Signi ﬁ cant differences in SNP 43 and SNP 44 genotype, and also allele frequency were observed in 3 groups, among which the OSAHS  $+\left|\mathbb{S}\right|$   group had higher SNP 43 and SNP 44 allele frequency than the control and OSAHS groups. There were differences regarding apnea-hypopnea index, minimum  ﬁ ngertip blood oxygen saturation   $(\mathsf{L S a O}_{2}\,[\%])$  , oxygen reduction index (ODI) between patients with different genotypes of SNP 43 and SNP 44 in OSAHS patients, and also GC and AT frequency in the OSAHS  $^+$  IS and OSAHS groups. As compared with the OSAHS group, the MoCA scores and MoCA subitems in the  $\mathsf{O S A H S+I S}$   group were declined, whereas the Scienti ﬁ c Data System scores were elevated. Additionally, GG 43 genotype, high apnea-hypopnea index, and body mass index were detected as the risk factors of OSAHS.  

Conclusion:  These  ﬁ ndings indicate that the  Calpain-10  SNP 43 may be related to OSAHS with IS, with SNP 43 GG genotype as a risk factor for OSAHS with IS.

# 1. Introduction  

Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is clinically de ﬁ ned as a disordered breathing event that may cause a blockage or narrowing of the upper airway, which is in occurrence with symptoms such as sleepiness, and also snoring. OSAHS is a common chronic disorder that occurs on a similar frequency as type I diabetes and twice that of asthma. The prevalence of OSAHS in the United States is estimated up to  $24\%$  for men and   $9\,\%$   for women.   The pathogen es is of OSAHS involves an interaction between ventilator y control instability and poor pharyngeal anatomy. It is also believed that OSAHS may be triggered by anatomic factors that promote pharyngeal narrowing, such as large neck circumference, cervical soft tissue, vessels, and bony structures.   OSAHS exhibits the highest incidence rate among sleep-related diseases and is also followed by various complications among which cardiovascular diseases are the most common and severe.   To the best of our knowledge, recent years have witnessed an intensi ﬁ cation of the study with aims to establish the genetic contribution to the occurrence of OSAHS, and also its sequelae.  

Calpain-10  is identi ﬁ ed as the  ﬁ rst type 2 diabetes mellitus gene in a genome-wide scan followed by positional cloning, and is located on chromosome 2q37, encoding  Calpain-10 , which is a commonly expressed member of the Calpain-like cysteine protease family. Functional genetic data reveals that Calpain-10  plays an instrumental part in insulin resistance and intermediate phenotypes, including those related to adipocytes. Calpain-10  may promote the translocation of GLUT4 through reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the Calpain-10  gene has been implicated in several aspects of metabolism syndrome including plasma cholesterol concentrations,   elevated body mass index (BMI),   hypertension, and hyper triglyceride mia.   Four  Calpain-10  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 19 (rs3842570), 43 (rs3792267), 44 (rs2975760), and 63 (rs5030952) have been commonly investigated for their potential roles, acting as risk markers for type 2 diabetes that is a complex metabolic disorder with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.   In accord with previous studies, this study aims to perform an association study between  Calpain-10  SNPs including SNP 43, SNP 44, and SNP 19, and also the occurrence of OSAHS and OSAHS with ischemic stroke (IS).  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. Study subjects  

In all, 186 OSAHS patients (OSAHS group) and 198 OSAHS patients with IS   $(\mathrm{OSHS+IS}$   group) were admitted into the Xianyang Hospital of Yan ’ an University between October 2013 and November 2015. The OSAHS was diagnosed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria,   and the diagnosis of OSAHS patients with IS was done according to the criteria of both OSAHS   and IS.   The included criteria were as follows: OSAHS patients con ﬁ rmed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); OSAHS patients con ﬁ rmed by poly so mno gram; OSAHS patients with symptoms like sleeping in the daytime and snoring at night; and OSAHS patients with good compliance. Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with coma, much oral secretion, and no ability to expectorate; patients with pulmonary infection; patients with mass bunamiodyl in sternum, severe aerothorax, or media st in al emphysema; patients with acute myocardial infarction and acute left ventricular failure; patients with uncontrollable acute ear, nasitis, and nasal sinusitis infection; patients with large area of cerebral infarction and brain stem infarction; patients with glaucoma; and patients with hypertension or diabetes, or undergoing anti hypertension and anti diabetic treatment. All subjects included in this study were not bloodrelated. Additionally, this study also recruited 240 healthy individuals as the control group, who were inquired for medical history before undergoing screening for exclusion of OSAHS using a Stardust portable sleep monitor, followed by a con ﬁ rmation of normal blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, breathing state, liver and kidney function, and hemogram. The clinical trial regime was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xianyang Hospital of Yan ’ an University and strictly complied with the Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects in the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects or their legal representatives signed informed contents and well understood the trail contents, processes, and possible side-effects.  

# 2.2. Information collection and index detection  

Baseline data of all subjects were collected, including sex, age, BMI, diabetes history, hypertension, and smoking. Each fasting subject underwent the extraction of peripheral venous blood  $.10\,\mathrm{mL})$  ) in the morning, and  $5\,\mathrm{mL}$   of the extracted blood was put into he par in i zed tubes. After 20minutes of cent ri fuga tion (3000 revolutions/min), the blood sample was packed in Eppendorf tubes. Enzyme method was used to detect tria cy l glycerol (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) by Hitachi 7600 automatic biochemical analyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The remaining   $5\,\mathrm{mL}$   of peripheral venous blood was put in ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) tubes and reserved at  $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   in a refrigerator for genomic DNA extraction and further experiments.  

# 2.3. Enzyme-linked immuno s or bent assay  

Enzyme-linked immuno s or bent assay (ELISA) was conducted for the Calpain-10 protein expression in the peripheral blood both in the case and control groups. The enzyme-labeled plate coated by antibodies were taken out, and in its wells added with standard samples and samples to be tested of various concentrations, respectively, which were then incubated at   $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 2hours. After the solution elimination,   $0.1\,\mathrm{mL}$   of bio tiny late d antibodies were added in each well at   $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30minutes, followed by phosphate buffer saline (PBS) washing for 5 times. Then  $0.1\,\mathrm{mL}$  of tetra methyl benz i dine (TMB) for each well was used for developing at  $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 20minutes and TMB stopping solution in the same dosage for stopping reaction. The optical density (OD) in the enzyme-labeled plate was detected at the wavelength of  $450\,\mathrm{nm}$  . The ELISA kit was purchased from the Shanghai Ximei Biotechnology Co. Ltd (ELX800, Shanghai, China).  

# 2.4. Monitor index of sleep apnea  

All subjects were prohibited against alcohol, coffee, tranquilizer, and hypnotic within 24hours before monitoring, and then they continuously received sleep apnea monitoring with no less than 7hours by a poly so mno graph y (PSG; Somno-star; Sensor medics, Anheim, CA) at night in a sleep laboratory. Monitor index of sleep apnea included: apnea-hypopnea index (AHI),  ﬁ gure arterial   $\mathrm{O}_{2}$   saturation   $\mathrm{(SaO_{2})}$  )    ${<}90\%$  , oxygen reduction index

# 2.5. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and PCR allele-speci ﬁ c ampli ﬁ cation (ASA)  

A total of   $2\,\mathrm{mL}$   of EDTA anticoagulant, genomic DNA from peripheral blood according to the conventional phenol/chloroform/iso prop an ol method   were extracted using EPPendorf UV spectrophotometry to measure DNA concentration and normalize it to   $50\,\mathrm{{ng}/\mathrm{{mL}}}$  . The 3 SNP primers of  Calpain-10  gene were synthesized by Shanghai Boya biological Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China) as shown in Table 1. The PCR reaction system ded  $2.5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$     $10\times$  P er solution,   $11.3\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of  $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O}$  ,  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$  L of dNTP, 0.2  $0.2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$  L (5U/  $(5\,\mathrm{U}/\upmu\mathrm{L})$  L) of Taq polymerase, 2  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$  L of template DNA,  $1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of the upstream and downstream primers, and  $0.75\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of R2 and  $0.25\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of L primer in the SNP44 locus R1 primer. The PCR conditions are as follows: pre de natura tion at  $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for 5minutes, 30 cycles of de natura tion at  $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for 30 seconds, annealing at  $55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30seconds, and ampli ﬁ cation at  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30seconds, and  ﬁ nal extension at  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 10minutes. The products of SNP 43 were identi ﬁ ed by  $2\,\%$   gel electrophoresis after digested by NsiI incision enzyme in water bath at   $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 16hours. However, the products of SNP 19 and SNP 44 are directly identi ﬁ ed by   $2\,\%$   gel electrophoresis.  

# 2.6. Restriction enzyme digestion and electrophoresis  

The products of PCR SNP43 were identi ﬁ ed by NsiI enzyme. After restriction enzyme treatment, 3 kinds of genotypes were produced: wild-type GG for  $144{\,\mathrm{top}}$  , heterozygous mutation type for 144, 121, and 23bp, and pure mutant type AA for 121 and 23 bp. SNP19 was the insertion deletion polymorphism, and its PCR products after electrophoresis were directly divided into 3 types: wild-type 11 for 142bp, heterozygous mutant 12 for 174 and 142 bp, and pure mutant type 22 for 174bp. PCR SNP44 products was directly assigned into 3 kinds of genotypes after electrophoresis: wild-type TT for  $60\,\mathrm{{bp}}$  , heterozygous mutant TC for 60 and  $75{\mathrm{\,bp}}$  , and pure mutant CC for  $75{\mathrm{\,bp}}$   (as shown in Fig. 1).  

# 2.7. Assessment of cognition and anxiety  

All patients were assessed using the Montreal cognitive function rating scale   $(\mathrm{MoCA})^{[18]}$    in the same order. The total scores of MoCA  ${\ge}26$   represented normal cognitive function. Depression Scale Self-rating (Scienti ﬁ c Data System [SDS])   was used to evaluate the anxiety of the study objects, with SDS  ${<}50$   meaning no anxiety, 50 to 59 meaning mild anxiety, 60 to 69 meaning severe anxiety, and over 70 meaning severe anxiety.  

# 2.8. Statistical analysis  

SPSS 21 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used to statistically analyze the data. The measurement data were expressed by mean  $\pm$  standard deviation (SD), and before data analysis, normality and homogeneity of variance tests were conducted. If the distribution and variance were normally presented, the    $t$   test was used in the 2 groups for comparison and 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for single-factor analysis of variance for groups, and tested by SNK-q test. If not, the non parametric Kruskal-Wallis h rank-sum test was conducted, and Mann-Whitney  $U$   test was conducted for group comparisons. The count data were expressed by constituent ratio or rate using chi-square test. Relative risk of genotype was expressed by odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval (CI). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium method was used to detect group representation of samples. SHEsis software was utilized for haploid analysis and logistic regression method for the risk factors for OSAHS with IS, with  $P\!<\!0.05$   meaning statistically difference.

Using  Calpain-10  SNP 43 and SNP 44, BMI, AHI in the OSAHS and   $\mathrm{OSAHS}\,{+}\,\mathrm{IS}$   groups as independent variables,   $\mathrm{OSAHS}\,{+}\,\mathrm{IS}$   as dependent variable, un conditioned logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate regression coef ﬁ cient and calculate OR with  $95\%$   CI for risk factor of OSAHS with IS   $(\mathrm{OR}>1)$  ). As shown in Table 8, SNP 43 GG genotypes, high AHI, and high BMI were the risk factors of OSAHS with IS   $(\mathrm{OR}>1$  ,  $P\!<\!0.05,$  ).  

# 4. Discussion  

The study was designed to elucidate association between Calpain-10  gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of OSAHS and OSAHS with IS. SNP 63 was identi ﬁ ed as minor allele with the lowest allele frequency, always selected for some rare polymorphism studies; thus it was excluded in this study. Therefore, we demonstrated the positive association between Calpain-10  SNP 43 and SNP 44 polymorphisms, and the risk of OSAHS and OSAHS with IS.  

The key  ﬁ ndings from this study indicated that the frequency of SNP  $43\ \mathrm{GHz}$   genotype and SNP 44 TC genotype in the OSAHS and  $\mathrm{OSAHS}\,{+}\,\mathrm{IS}$   groups were remarkably higher than that in the case group. Calpains are a very common family of the calciumdependent cysteine proteases which are always involved in a large range of differentiation processes and cell regulatory.   It was reported that Calpains played a pivotal role in neuro de generation, cell motility, and synaptic plasticity, among which mucalpain (calpain-1) and m-calpain (calpain-2) were 2 major calpain isoforms shown in brain.   Calpain-10 protein, as intracellular Ca   $(2+)$  -dependent cysteine protease, exerts effects on regulation of thermo genesis, pancreatic  $\upbeta$  -cell function, and glucose metabolism, and several sites of Calpain-10 polymorphism are researched for their potential markers for the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.   It is sited in mitochondria, which is of importance in mitochondrial homeostasis, implicated in diabetes-induced renal dysfunction, indicating that loss of Calpain-10 induced by glucose in vivo leads to organ failure and renal cell apoptosis via collections of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial calpain-10 substrates.   To our knowledge, there is a connection between the severity of OSAHS and both damaged glucose tolerance, and also insulin resistance, suggesting that obstructive sleep apnea-related diseases are risk factors for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease, such as type 2 diabetes.   Also, the occurrence rate of obstructive sleep apnea-related diseases was found signi ﬁ cantly higher in the patients with type 2 diabetes.   These data have proposed the presumption of type 2 diabetes as a risk factor for OSAHS, arising with a bidirectional fashion, and  Calpain-10  was de ﬁ ned as the  ﬁ rst gene in ﬂ uencing the risk of type 2 diabetes by positioning cloning and the possibility of association between SNP 43 and SNP 44 polymorphisms, and transcriptional regulation  Calpain-10  expression has been raised.   A study performed by Ling et al   has reported that the  Calpain-10 mRNA level was increased by   $64\%$   in pancreatic islets from patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison with non diabetic individuals. Horikawa et al   also discovered that mutation in Calpain-10  gene has been linked to a 3-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-Americans, and also in Northern European populations. It was also believed that variation of the  Calpain-10  gene (SNP 43 GG and SNP 44 TT) had connections with elevated levels of total cholesterol.   Taken together, our study assumed that SNP 43 and SNP 44 polymorphisms of  Calpain-10  gene might affect the variance in  Calpain-10  mRNA level so as to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, ultimately contributing to the development of OSAHS. In our study, however, there was no signi ﬁ cant

difference in SNP 19 genotype and allele frequency between the OSAHS,   $\mathrm{OSAHS}\,{+}\,\mathrm{IS}$  , and control groups. In the study by Zaharna et al,   they uncovered that, in the donors with type 2 diabetes, the total cholesterol levels were higher in the SNP 19 22 genotype than those in 12 or 11 genotype, which was signi ﬁ cantly different from our results. Nevertheless, the above positive data were also changed by the studies conducted by Carlsson et al and Daimon et al.   This difference in results could be due to the limited studies that investigated total cholesterol, and also triglyceride levels and their associations with  Calpain-10,  which needs further investigation.  

Additionally, there were signi ﬁ cant differences in these monitor indexes of sleep apnea between the OSAHS patients and OSAHS patients with IS. The severity of OSAHS is commonly measured by the AHI that re ﬂ ects the number of AHI per hour of sleep, with  $5/\mathrm{h}$   regarded as normal, AHI 5 to   $15/$  h as mild, AHI 15 to   $29/\mathrm{h}$   as moderate, and AHI   $30/\mathrm{h}$   as severe.   In our study, we found that the OSAHS patients with IS show increased AHI compared with the OSAHS patients, possibly suggesting that OSAHS with IS would deteriorate OSAHS. The ODI refers to the number of events per hour in which oxygen saturation declines by  $4\,\%$   or more. Interestingly, hypopnea implicates a reduction of air ﬂ ow by  $50\%$   to  $80\%$   for at least 10seconds related to either oxygen de saturation of at least  $4\,\%$   or arousals. Our results also demonstrated that the OSAHS patients with IS had increased ODI compared with the OSAHS patients. Consistent with our study, Park et al   supported the possibility of the severe OSAHS patients with greater oxygen de saturation. Also, our study revealed that the OSAHS patients with IS exhibit decreased  $\mathrm{LSaO}_{2}$   and  $\mathrm{MSaO}_{2}$  . As reported in the study performed by Ursavas et al,   the patients with OSAHS had remarkable lower   $\mathrm{MSaO}_{2}$  , but longer time of   $\mathrm{SaO}_{2}<\!90\%$  than the healthy controls. Also, there were signi ﬁ cant differences in AHI,   $\mathrm{LSaO}_{2}$  ,   $\mathrm{MSaO}_{2}$  , ODI, time of   $\mathrm{SaO}_{2}<\!90\%$  , and REM/ TST among the SNP 43 GG, GA, and AA, and between the SNP  $44~\mathrm{TT}$   and TC, suggesting that SNP 43 GG and SNP 44 TG is linked to OSAHS.  

In conclusion, the logistic regression analysis indicated that SNP 43 AA, SNP 44 TC, and larger neck circumference were the risk factors of OSAHS and OSAHS with IS. Collectively,  Calpain $10\:\mathrm{SNR}\:43$   and SNP 44 polymorphisms were correlated with the risk of OSAHS and OSAHS with IS. Disease association with certain variants of  Calpain-10  found in certain populations may not be applicable for other populations due to detecting the expected variants in only part of all populations. Increased or decreased frequency of particular genotypes depends on genetic and environmental factors, such as linkage d is equilibrium, founder effect together with selection. Apart from this, our study consisted of a small sample size, since it is better to recruit a large sample size in genetic association studies. Thus, further indepth researches will be performed to explore the mechanism of Calpain-10  SNPs on the in ﬂ uencing factors, such as total cholesterol and triglycerides in cardiovascular diseases and metabolism syndromes.
