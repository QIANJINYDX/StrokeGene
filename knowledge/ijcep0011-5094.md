Abstract:  Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex disease caused by an obstruction within a brain-supplying blood vessel  that involves both genetic and environmental factors. In this study, we evaluated the association of genetic polymorphisms   in the   AHSG gene with ischemic stroke risk in the Chinese population. A case-control study was conducted  that included 477 ne phr opa thy patients and 490 healthy controls. Chi-squared tests and a genetic model were used  to evaluate associations. In the genetic model analysis, we identified that the SNP of rs2070634 in the AHSG gene  was associated with a 1.37-fold increase the risk of stroke in the co-dominant model (adjusted, the  $"G/\Gamma"$   genotype),  and a 1.40-fold increase the risk of stroke in the Over-dominant model (adjusted, the  $"G/\Gamma"$   genotype), respectively.  The rs2518136 in the AHSG   gene was associated with a 1.37-fold increase the risk of stroke in the co-dominant  model (adjusted, the “T/C” genotype) and a 1.41-fold decrease the risk of stroke in the over-dominant model (adjusted, the “T/C” genotype), respectively. We found four SNPs (rs2248690, rs2070634, rs4917 and rs2518136)  show a strong linkage, but the AHSG   haplotype was not found to be associated with a risk of ischemic stroke. The  present study suggests that the AHSG   polymorphism may contribute to an increased risk of ischemic stroke.

# Introduction  

Stroke, as a serious cerebro vascular disease,  is a leading cause of death and long-term adult  disability throughout the world [1]. Because  stroke involves high morbidity and high mortality [2], the medical community has linked it with  coronary heart disease and cancer as one of  the three major diseases that threaten human  life and health [3-5]. Ischemic stroke (IS), the  most common type, results from a local cerebral ischemia that occurs with an obstruction  within a brain-supplying blood vessel [6, 7]. The  specific reasons for the patho-physiological  cause of Ischemic stroke are still not clear.  Previous studies have demonstrated that  Ischemic stroke is a complex and heterogeneous disease influenced by both genetic and  environmental factors (such as age, smoking,  high blood pressure, abdominal obesity, cardiac arrhythmia s, diabetes mellitus, and lack of  physical activities) [8-10].  

Until now, large-scale genome-wide association  studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic  polymorphisms that are associated with the  risk of ischemic stroke. For example, XingYang  [11] et al. found that  CYP2C8 ,  EPHX2 , and  CYP4A11  gene variants could increase the risk  for ischemic stroke. Nan Zhao [12] et al. studied inflammatory gene polymorphisms with  ischemic stroke. Qiaoya [13] et al. found that  IMPA2  can increase the risk of ischemic stroke.  Qing [14] et al. found that the  CYP2J2  gene can  increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Qu Z [15]  et al. studied the association of a tagging  ALOX5AP  polymorphism with the risk of ischemic stroke.  

AHSG is a hepatic secretory protein that inhibits arterial calcium deposition in vitro [16].  AHSG is an important circulating inhibitor of  ectopic mineral calcification, abundant in blood  plasma, and which may be related to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and cerebro vascular

The candidate SNPs in the  ASHG  gene were selected  from previously published  polymorphisms associated with ischemic stroke.  The minor allele frequencies (MAF) of all the selected SNPs were  $>5\%$   in the  

HapMap Chinese population. Some SNPs sh-ould be excluded   $(P<0.01\$   for deviations from  HWE). All the selected SNPs in the study were  successfully genotyped with an average call  rate of   $99.68\%$  . Blood samples were collected  in tubes containing Ethylene dia mine tetra acetic  acid (EDTA) and stored at -80C after centrifuging at 1,500 rpm for 10 min. DNA was extracted from whole blood using the GoldMag-Mini  Whole Blood Genomic DNA Purification Kit  (GoldMag Co. Ltd. Xi’an City, China). We used  NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,  Massachusetts, USA) to measure the DNA concentration. The design of SNP genotyping and  data processing were performed by Sequenom  MassARRAY platform Software (Sequenom Co.  Ltd., San Diego, California, USA) [25]. Genotype  calling was carried out with version 3.0 of  MassARRAY RT software and analyzed byversion 3.4 of MassARRAY Typer software [26].  Sequenom Typer 4.0 software was used for  data management and analysis.  

diseases [17]. Previous studies have reported  the AHSG gene is associated with various diseases, including coronary atherosclerosis [18,  19], coronary heart disease [20, 21], and athero sclerosis disease [22, 23]. However, few  studies have examined the association bet-ween the AHSG gene and ischemic stroke. In  the current study, we evaluated a significant  association between 5 SNPs in the AHSG gene  and the ischemic stroke risk in a Han Chinese  population.

Ethics statement  

The study protocol was approved by the insti-tutional ethics committee. All blood samples  were collected following informed written consent of the participating individuals. The experimental protocol was implemented in accordance with the approved guidelines.  

Statistical analysis  

Subjects  

Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and  SPSS Statistics (version 17.0, SPSS, Chicago,  IL) were used for statistical analyses.   $P\le0.05$    was considered to be statistically significant.  SNP genotype frequencies in the case and control groups were calculated by Chi-square test,  and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was  used to check the genotype frequency of the  control group. Odds ratios (ORs) and  $95\%$   confidence intervals   $.95\%$   CIs) were tested using  unconditional logistic regression analysis with  adjustment for age and gender [27]. Three  models (dominant, recessive, log-additive) were  applied by PLINK software (http://pngu.mgh. harvard.edu/purcell/plink/) to assess the association of SNPs with the risk of ischemic stro-ke [28]. Furthermore, Haploview (version 4.2,  Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) and SHEsis  software were used for checking the linkage  d is equilibrium structure [29].  

We recruited a total of 477 patients, who were  diagnosed with ischemic stroke (310 males  and 167 females; age at diagnosis:   $62.40\pm$    9.22 years) according to the fourth edition of  Cerebro vascular Disease Diagnostic Standards  [24]. These patients from Northwestern China  were enrolled in the study at the Second  Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University  from March 2011 to April 2016. These patients  have no genetic relationship. The control group  was composed of 490 healthy subjects (320  males and 170 females; age:   $53.95{\scriptstyle\pm11.20}$    years) who were recruited from routine healthy  examinations in the same hospitals. The controls were not related to the case group and  had no history of cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack. The first and second  degree relatives of the controls had no cerebrovascular diseases or hypertension.

# Results  

# Characteristics of the participants  

This study involved 967 subjects, including 477  patients (310 males and 167 females; age at  diagnosis:   $62.40{\scriptstyle\pm9.22}$   years) and 490 healthy  controls (320 males and 170 females; age:   $53.95{\scriptstyle\pm11.20}$   years). The stroke cases and con-trols were matched by sex, but there was a significant difference in age between ischemic  stroke cases and controls   $(P<0.001)$  ) ( Table 1 ).  

The associations between AHSG and ischemic  stroke  

Table 2  shows the basic information of candidate SNPs in this study, including chromosomal  position, gene, allele, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test results, and minor allele fre- quency (MAF),  $95\%$   CI and the  $p$  -value of allele.  One SNP (rs2070633) was excluded for significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium   $(P<0.01)$  ). We used the chi-squared test to  assess the risk of gene polymorphism in the  allele model, but there is no statistically significant association between the allele and ischemic stroke risk, and the Bonferroni correction  also confirms this result ( Table 2 ).  

Associations between genotype frequencies  and ischemic stroke risk  

As shown in  Table 3 , we found that the rs-2070634 in the AHSG gene was associated  with a 1.37-fold increase the risk of ischemic

  $"G/\Gamma"$   genotype) and a 1.40-fold increase the  risk of ischemic stroke in the over-dominant  model (adjusted   $\mathsf{O R}\,=\,\bot.40$  ,   $95\%$     ${\sf C I}\;=\;1.06.$  1.85,  $P=~0.016$   for the   $"G/\Gamma"$   genotype), res-pectively. The rs2518136 in the AHSG gene  was associated with a 1.37-fold increase the  risk of ischemic stroke in the co-dominant mo-del   $(0\mathsf{R}=1.37\$  ,   $95\%\,{\sf C I}=\bot.02–1.84$  ,    $P=0.042$    for the “T/C” genotype) and a 1.41-fold increase  the risk of ischemic stroke in the over-dominant  model   $(0\mathsf{R}\,=\,\mathbb{1}.4\mathbb{1}$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}\;=\;1.07{\cdot}1.86$  ,   $P\,=$    0.014 for the “T/C” genotype), respectively.  

Associations between haplotype analyses and  ischemic stroke risk  

LD and haplotype analyses of the SNPs in the  case and control samples were further studied.  The haplotype analysis detected the block in  the AHSG genes ( Figure 1 ). Although the four  candidate SNPs (rs2248690, rs2070634, rs-4917 and rs2518136) in the AHSG gene have  shown strong linkage ( Figure 1 ), the result for  the AHSG   haplotype was not found to be associated with a risk of ischemic stroke, because  the  $p$   value had no statistical difference ( Table  4 ). In addition, we did not find any association  between the TF haplotype and the risk of  stroke.  

# Discussion  

Genetic studies have provided insight into  numerous cardiovascular and cerebro vascular  diseases, including ischemic stroke. In our stu-dy, we selected 5 SNPs in AHSG   in the Chinese  population to investigate their associations  with the risk of ischemic stroke. Our results  suggest that two SNPs (rs2070634, rs2518-  136) were associated with an increased risk of  ischemic stroke. These results suggest that  genetic polymorphisms in the AHSG gene may  play an important role in increasing the risk of  ischemic stroke in the Chinese population.  

The AHSG   (alpha  $^2$  -Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein), also called Fetuin A, is a 63-kDa glycoprotein synthesized by the liver and secreted into  the serum [17], which is located at chromosome 3q27, and its locus is associated with  cardiovascular disease [21, 30-32]. The AHSG   gene is mainly secreted by he pato cyte s and is  abundant in blood plasma [33]. Previous studies about genome-wide association studies  (GWAS) have confirmed   that   the AHSG polymorphism was associated with the risk of cardiovascular and cerebro vascular diseases [34].  For example, Eva Fisher [35] et al. researched  the association of five tagging SNPs (rs2248-  690, rs2070633, rs2070635, rs4917, and rs-6787344) in the AHSG gene and the risk of cardio vascular disease, the study results suggesting an involvement of fetuin-A in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Lehtinen [36] et  al. studied the AHSG gene polymorphisms and  the sub clinical atherosclerosis risk, and the  results indicated that the AHSG gene is related  to death by cardiovascular disease. Several  studies also have reported that the AHSG gene  plays a key role in ischemic stroke (IS) and  rs4917 is considered AHSG’s strongest marker  in plasma levels. For example, Ma [37] et al.  studied the association of the AHSG   polymorphism and the risk of ischemic stroke, and  these result suggest that the rs4918 SNPs of  the AHSG gene can increase the risk of ischemic stroke in the Northern Han Chinese population. In this study, we found that two tSNPs  (rs2070634, rs2518136) were associated with  an increased risk of ischemic stroke in the  genetic model analysis, and the four candidate

SNPs (rs2248690, rs2070634, rs4917 and  rs2518136) in the AHSG gene showed a strong  linkage, so this provides a new theoretical basis  for the ischemic stroke study. Therefore, these  results indicate that  the  AHSG   gene   plays a pivotal role in ischemic stroke. More samples and  functional tests are required to confirm our  results, and we will be working on them.  

Some potential limitations of our study should  be considered when analyzing the results.  Firstly, the sample size of our study was small.  Secondly, selection bias was inevitable. Thirdly,  associations between AHSG   polymorphisms  and clinic o pathological disease type were not  evaluated in this study. Additional studies are  needed to illuminate the genetic mechanisms  underlying ischemic stroke by fine-mapping the  susceptibility regions of the variants.  

To sum up, in this study, we confirmed that the  AHSG gene was associated with the risk of  ischemic stroke in the Chinese population once  again, a finding which may provide new data  and theoretical bases to facilitate earlier diagnosis and prevention, and illuminate the new  candidate genes and new ideas for the study of  subsequent occurrence mechanisms of isch- emic stroke. Therefore, more studies should  investigate these SNPs using more clinical data  with bigger samples. And in the future, we will  continue to collect samples, perfect the clinical  information, and do a comprehensive study   of the impact of polymorphisms on ischemic  stroke.
