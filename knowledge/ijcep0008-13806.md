Abstract:  In this study, by using vivo and vitro model, we assessed whether interleukin (IL)-1beta gene polymorphisms influence on the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke at young age. 147 patients (age   $<45$    years) with a first episode of MI and 56 patients (age  $<45$   years) with first-ever cerebral ischemia consecutively were  admitted to this study from the Department of Chinese PLA General Hospital. Meanwhile, 91 normal volunteers  without MI or stroke were deeded as control group and greed to give blood samples for DNA analysis and biochemical measurements by written informed consent. IL-1β-511 wild type (WT, CC) and SNP (TT) were established and  trans fec ted into Rat myocardial H9c2 cell and Mouse brain endo the li al bEND.3 cells. In Young Age MI or stroke  patients, the IL-1β levels of patients with 511CC are higher than that of patients with 511TT. In our study, NF-κB  miRNA, iNOS activity, NF-κB, iNOS and Bax protein expressions of MI-induced H9c2 cell or stroke-induced bEND.3  cells in IL-1β-511TT group were lower than those of IL-1β-511CC. Additionally, the protein expression of MMP-2 of MIinduced H9c2 cell or stroke-induced bEND.3 cells in IL-1β-511TT group were higher than that of IL-1β 511CC group.  In conclusion, our data indicate that IL-1β-511TT/CC influence on the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic  stroke at young age through NF-κB, iNOS, MMP-2 and Bax.

# Introduction  

With the gradual rising of morbidity and fatality  rate, myocardial infarction (AMI) has already  become the first killer of threatening national  health seriously [1]. The main cause of death  for acute myocardial infarction is acute heart  failure. Nowadays, with the improvement of  medical level, internal medicine thr ombo lysis,  interventional stent and surgical bypass surgery dramatically decrease the probability for  acute myocardial infarction to develop into  acute heart rate and then lead to death, and  such a disease is developed into the chronic  stage with the further development of condition  [2]. Chronic stage mainly gives priority to cardiac fibrosis remodeling, which will trigger chronic heart failure and result in death, if fibrosis  remodeling is excessive [3]. However, there  have been no good methods to prevent and  cure cardiac fibrosis remodeling until now.  

Stroke is an acute cerebro vascular disease,  which is sudden onset, caused by local hemodynamic disorders of brain, and has the common characteristic of focal neurologic deficits,  is one of three major diseases of death, due to  high morbidity, death rate, disability rate and  recurrence rate, ranks the first place in the  cause of death for urban residents and second  place in the cause of death for rural residents in  our country, and is also the first disease of  causing disability [4]. Ischemic stroke (IS) occupies   $70\%{80\%}$   of all IS and has high morbidity,  critical condition, higher death rate and disability rate, because etiology and pathogen es is  haven’t been definite completely yet and clinically ideal treatment is limited [5]. At present,  clinical treatment on IS mainly can be divided  into thr ombo ly tic drug therapy, which has been  the only confirm at ive effective method so far,  and drug therapy of neuro protection [6].  However, only   $5\%$   of patients can acquire effective thr ombo ly tic therapy, because of shorter  

13]. Therefore, in this study,  we assessed whether IL-1beta  gene polymorphisms influence on the risk of myocardial  infarction and ischemic stroke  at young age in vivo and in  vitro.

Study population  

A total of 147 patients (age  $<$  45 years) with a first episode  of MI consecutively were  admitted to this study from  

the Department of Chinese PLA General  Hospital. All patients were defined as resting  chest pain lasting 30 min accompanied with  ST-segment elevation evolving into pathological  Q waves. Meanwhile, they also detected total  creatinine kinase (CK) or muscle brain fraction  levels of more than twice the upper normal  limit.  

therapeutic window and higher bleeding risk  [7].  

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) includes two different subtypes of ligand: IL-1α and   ${\sf L I\!-\!\!1\beta}$   and can play a  role by combining with IL-1 type receptor (IL-1RI)  and using G-protein coupling mechanism. The  biological activity of IL-1ci and IL-10 currently  can’t be distinguished, IL-1α displays biological  activity in the form of membrane correlation,  while IL-1P mainly appears in blood circulation  and plays a leading role in cardiovascular system. In addition, human body has natural IL-1  receptor antagonist (IL-Ira) to restrain conduction of IL-1 signal through 1L-1RI of competitive  binding.  

A total of 56 patients (age  $<45$   years) with firstever cerebral ischemia consecutively were  admitted to this study from the Department of  Chinese PLA General Hospital.  All patients  were defined as a sudden loss of global or focal  cerebral function that persisted with a probable vascular cause for   $^{24}\textsf{h}$   and confirmed by  brain CT or MRI. 91 normal volunteers without  MI or stroke were deeded as control group and  greed to give blood samples for DNA analysis  and biochemical measurements by written  informed consent.  

IL-1 is defined as “the first endogenous pyrogen”, because it was originally discovered with  function of inducing fever of rabbits and  humans [8]. IL-1β has the pro-inflammatory  function and its important role in multiple cardio vascular diseases is gradually realized by  people with the further study [9]. IL-1β participates in the progress of atherosclerosis, including local lesion formation of atherosclerosis,  inflammatory reaction of vascular wall, unbalanced plaque and vulnerable plaque rupture,  etc., a series of pathological process [10]. IL-1β  takes part in post-inf﻿﻿lammatory reaction of  myocardial infarction, enhances expression of  matrix metal lo protein as e, and participates in  poor myocardial remodeling [11]. Lots of recent  studies show that   ${\sf L I L I B}$   participates in the  occurrence and development of heart failure,  while IL-1β takes part in inflammatory reaction  in the process of heart failure, plays a direct  toxic effect on cardiac muscle, promotes apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells, and participates  in left ventricle remodel of heart failure [12,

# Results  

# IL-1β-511WT and SNP and Risk of MI at young  age  

As shown in  Figure 1 , the   ${\sf L I S}$  levels of young  age MI patients carrying 511CC were highest in  all patients carrying three genes. Meanwhile,  the   ${\sf L I S}$   levels of Young Age MI patients with  511TC were higher than that of patients with  511TT ( Figure 1 ). These results showed that  IL-1β 511TT may inhibit the IL-1β levels in Young  Age MI patients.

# IL-1β-511WT and SNP and Risk of Ischemic  stroke at young age  

The effect of IL-1β-511WT and SNP on iNOS in  MI-induced cell  

Figure 6  showed that IL-1β-511WT and SNP  had different influence on the ischemic stroke  at young age patients. Firstly, in young age  patients with ischemic stroke, the IL-1β levels in  IL-1β 511CC group were also highest. Next, the  IL-1β levels of young age ischemic stroke  patients with 511TT were also lowest in all genotypes ( Figure 6 ).  

We researched that the role of IL-1β-511WT on  iNOS in MI-induced cell. As shown in  Figure 3 ,  the iNOS miRNA and protein expression level of  IL-1β 511TT in MI-induced H9c2 cell was lower  than that of MI-induced H9c2 cell trans fec ted  with IL-1β 511CC.

MI is caused by myocardial  necrosis of a part, because  myocardial blood circulation  is suspended suddenly and  completely [15]. With the  gradual rising of morbidity  and fatality rate, MI has  already become the first killer  of threatening national health  seriously  [15].  The  main  cause of death for acute myocardial infarction is acute  heart failure. Nowadays, with  the improvement of medi-cal level, internal medicine  

thr ombo lysis, interventional stent and surgical  bypass surgery dramatically decrease the probability for acute myocardial infarction to develop into acute heart rate and then lead to death,  and such a disease is developed into the chronic stage with the further development of condition [16]. Chronic stage mainly gives priority to  cardiac fibrosis remodeling, which will trigger  chronic heart failure and result in death, if fibrosis remodeling is excessive [17]. However, there  have been no good methods to prevent and  cure cardiac fibrosis remodeling until now. We  found that the IL-1β levels of Young Age MI or  stroke patients with 511TC were higher than  that of patients with 511TT.  

The effect of IL-1β-511WT and SNP on NF-κB  in stroke-induced cell  

After stroke, the effect of IL-1β-511WT and   SNP on NF-κB in stroke-induced cell   was  explored in our study. The activity and protein  expression of NF $\cdot\mathsf{K B}$   were markedly suppressed  in   ${\sf L I L I B}$  -511TT, compared with IL-1β 511CC  ( Figure 7 ).  

The effect of IL-1β-511WT and SNP on iNOS in  stroke-induced cell  

Furthermore, to explore the effect of IL-1β- 511WT and SNP on iNOS in stroke-induced cell,  iNOS activity and iNOS protein expression were  measured. As shown in  Figure 8 , iNOS activity  and iNOS protein expression of stroke-induced  bEND.3 cells in IL-1  $\upbeta$  -511TT group were lower  than those of IL-1β-511CC.  

IS is one of the commonest reasons for death  and causing disability of adults in a majority of  countries and one of three major diseases with  the highest death rate in the world, except for  coronary heart disease and cancer [18].  Ischemic stroke occupies   $70\%{80\%}$  of all IS,  not only brings psychosomatic destruction to  patients, but also causes a white elephant to  the society and family [18]. Thus, a major  important mission of modern medical field is to  carry out prevention and treatment of IS positively. In recent 20 years, domestic and overseas have carried out lots of studies on epidemic disease and preventive control of IS [19].  It is noted that morbidity of IS has the rising  trend. The statistical data from ministry of  health show that IS ranks the first place and  second place in urban male and female causes  of death, respectively and ranks the second  place and third place in rural male and female  causes of death [20]. In recent years, with the  

The effect of IL-1β-511WT and SNP on MMP-2  in stroke-induced cell  

Furthermore, as shown in  Figure 9 , the protein  expression of MMP-2 memorably increased in  IL-1β-511TT group was observed in strokeinduced bEND.3 cells, compared with   ${\sf L I S}$  511CC.  

The effect of IL-1β-511WT and SNP on Bax in  stroke-induced cell  

Interestingly, when compared with the IL-1β  511CC group, Bax protein expression of strokeinduced bEND.3 cells was markedly diminished  in 511TT group ( Figure 10 ).

mation theory [20]. Many  studies mention that inflammation plays an extremely  important role on the occurrence, development and prognosis of IS [21]. One of  hotspots in the study field is  the relation between IS and  1L-1β, because 1L-1β is a  multi functional  cell  factor  with the anti-inflammatory  function [22]. In this study, we  found that IL-1β 511TT memorably suppressed the NF-κB  miRNA and protein expression level in MI-induced H9c2  cell or stroke-induced bEND.3  cells, compared with IL-1β  511CC.

Though existing studies have  already observed the acceleration of   ${\sf L I S}$   on the ischemic  myocardial apoptosis, specific molecular mechanism currently has been poorly understood [23]. IL-1  $\upbeta$   induces myocardial apoptosis of mice by  activating Bax and Bcl-xL, etc., BCL family  members of Nitric oxide (NO) mediation.  

further study on pathogen es is of IS, an increasing number of scholars have valued the inflam  

Inflammatory cytokines-IL-1α and IL $\cdot\upbeta$   can  develop complicated biological effect by regulating gene expression and behavior of multiple  cell types [24]. Multiple inflammatory diseases  (including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease) are induced to generate  and activate IL-1RI, trigger multiple phosphorylations successively, and result in nuclear  translocation of transcription factors, after tissue damage [25]. Though most of cells have  low expression of IL-1RI, IL-1 signal can transmit effectively after amplifying receptors. As  the substrate of Mitogen-Activated Protein  Kinase (MAPK), serine and threonine residues  are activated by IL-1 continuously [26].  Afterwards, protein kinase suffers from phosp hory la tion, ultimately resulting in rapid phosp hory la tion of IkB, and finally transcription factors have nuclear transition [27]. In our study,  iNOS activity, iNOS and Bax protein expressions  of MI-induced H9c2 cell or stroke-induced  bEND.3 cells in IL-1β-511TT group were lower  than those of IL-1β-511CC. Meanwhile, the protein expression of MMP-2 memorably increased  in  IL-1β-511TT  group  was  observed  in  MI-induced H9c2 cell or stroke-induced bEND.3  cells, compared with IL-1β 511CC.  

IL-1β  enhances  the  ability  of  Dermal  Micro vascular Endo the li al Cells to form tubular  structure, increases P-2 expression of cardiac  micro vascular endo the li al cells, and promotes  substrate degradation directly [28]. In addition,   ${\sf L I S}$   stimulates cardiac micro vascular vascular  endo the li al growth factors [29]. Collectively,  these data clearly indicate that IL-1β-511TT/CC  influence on the risk of myocardial infarction  and ischemic stroke at young age through  NF-κB, iNOS, MMP-2 and Bax.
