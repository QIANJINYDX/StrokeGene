# a b s t r a c t  

Background:  A GWAS found that the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11833579 near the NINJ2 gene on chromosome 12p13 was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in Caucasians in 2009. Several studies have been carried out to explore the association between this SNP and ischemic stroke in Asians, but published results were contradictory. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to further evaluate this association in the Asian population.  

Methods:  All relevant articles were retrieved from the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, CNKI, CQVIP, and WANFANG Database from the establishment date to February 2014. Statistical analyses were performed by using Stata 11. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence intervals  $.95\%$   CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. Possible publication bias was checked by funnel plots, Begg's test and Egger's test.  

Results:  Eleven studies were eligible for meta-analysis including 9358 cases and 8936 controls. Overall, there were no signi ﬁ cant associations between rs11833579 and ischemic stroke under the allelic (  $\mathbf{\dot{O}R}=0.963$  ,  $95\%$  CI: 0.850 – 1.092,   ${\mathsf{p}}=0.559.$  ), dominant (  $\mathrm{{CR}}=0.946$  ,  $95\%$  CI: 0.778 – 1.150,  ${\tt p}=0.580$  ), recessive   $(0\tt R=0.993$  ,  $95\%\,{\tt C I}\colon0.914{-}1.078,\mathfrak{p}=0.868)$  , and homozygote   $\mathbf{\dot{\Omega}}_{0\mathrm{R}}=0.968$  ,   $95\%$  CI: 0.796 – 1.177,   ${\mathsf{p}}=0.744.$  ) genetic models in the Asian population. Further, we found no evidence of association of rs11833579 with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) or small-artery occlusion (SAO) stroke in all genetic models. The results of the subgroup analysis for Chinese population and Japanese population were consistent with that of the overall study.  

Conclusions:  Our meta-analysis shows that SNP rs11833579 is not related to ischemic stroke in the Asian population.

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke is a major cause of disability and death in the aging population and about   $73\%$   to  $86\%$   of strokes are ischemic  [1,2] . Heritability for all ischemic strokes is  $37.9\%[3]$  , varied markedly by stroke subtype being   $40.3\%$   for large-vessel disease,   $32.6\%$   for card i oem boli c and

  $16.1\%$   for small-vessel disease  [3] . A genome-wide association study

 (GWAS) in 2009  [4]  con ﬁ rmed two single-nucleotide polymorphisms

 (SNPs), rs11833579 and rs12425791, which could increase the risk of ischemic stroke in Caucasians. The two intergenic SNPs are on chromosome 12p13 and within   $11\,\mathrm{kb}$   of the gene NINJ2. After nerve injury the expression of NINJ2 gene is increased in brain radial glia cell and lymphocytes  [5] . Ninjurin2 (nerve injury induced protein 2) encoded by the NINJ2 gene is an adhesion molecule and mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions during development, differentiation, and regeneration of the nervous system  [5,6] . Over the past few years several epidemiological studies were performed to evaluate the relation between SNP rs11833579 and ischemic stroke in Asians, yet these research results failed to reach an agreement. For investigating the association between SNP rs11833579 and ischemic stroke in the Asian population, we performed this meta-analysis with new searchable data.  

# 2. Methods and materials  

# 2.1. Search strategy  

We searched in the electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, CNKI, CQVIP and WANFANG

HWE(P): p values for Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium for each study's control group.  

Database from the establishment date to February 2014. The following search terms were used in isolation and combination with one another:

 “ stroke ”  or  “ cerebral ischemic ”  or  “ cerebral infarction ”  combined with

 “ rs11833579 ”  or  “ NINJ2 ”  or  “ Ninjurin2 ”  or  “ 12p13 ” . All studies matching the eligible criteria were included in our meta-analysis. The reference lists of included articles were also reviewed for additional literature.  

# 2.2. Inclusion criteria  

The selected original studies should comply with the following inclusion criteria: a) concerning the association between rs11833579 and ischemic stroke risk; b) case – control studies, c) with full text; d) based on Asian population; e) suf ﬁ cient genotype distribution data for estimating an odds ratio (OR) with  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval (CI); f) exclusion of conference papers; g) genotype distribution of control population must be in Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).  

# 2.3. Data extraction  

Two researchers read all publications complying with the inclusion criteria listed above and extracted the data independently. Disagreement was resolved through discussion. The following data were collected from each included study:  ﬁ rst author's name, publication date, country, study design (source of controls), total numbers of cases and controls and frequency of rs11833579 polymorphism in cases and controls. Evidence of Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium was collected, and p value less than 0.05 was considered signi ﬁ cant.  

# 2.4. Statistical analysis  

Pearson's goodness-ofﬁ t chi-square test was used to test the HWE for the genotype distributions in the control group of each study. The heterogeneity was calculated by Q test and the inconsistency index  $\big(\boldsymbol{\mathrm{I}}^{2}\big)$   [7] . The heterogeneity was considered signi ﬁ cant when   $\mathtt{p}<0.10$  or   $\mathrm{I}^{2}>50\%$   [7] , and a random effects model was used, otherwise, a ﬁ xed effects model was adopted to calculate the pooled OR. The effect size was expressed as OR and  $95\%$   CI. Four genetic models were used to pool the data: allelic model (A allele vs. G allele), dominant model  $(\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G}+\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{A}$   vs.  $\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{G}$  ), recessive model (A/A vs.  $\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G}+\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{G},$  ), homozygote model (A/A vs. G/G). Subgroup analysis was performed by stroke subtype and country. The funnel plots, Begg's test and Egger's test were used to assess the possible publication bias  [8] . All statistical tests were performed by STATA 11 (Stata, College Station, Texas, USA). The level of statistical signi ﬁ cance was set at   $\mathsf{p}<0.05$  .

# 3.1. Selection process and study characteristics  

Our literature search initially identi ﬁ ed 78 articles, PUBMED (  $\mathrm{'n=}$  20), EMBASE (  $\mathsf{\dot{n}}=33$  ), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (  $\mathrm{n}=$  9), CNKI (  $\mathrm{"n=4}$  ), WANFANG (  $\mathsf{\Delta}\mathsf{n}=5.$  ) and CQVIP   $(\mathsf{n}=7\$  ). If there were duplicate researches, only the latest and most comprehensive one was included. Manual searches of article bibliographies did not identify any additional studies. Two publications respectively included two  [9]  and three  [10]  separate case – control studies. Each study in one publication was considered separately for pooling analysis. Finally, eight publications  [9 – 16]  (9358 cases and 8936 controls) including eleven studies met the inclusion criteria and were involved in the current meta-analysis. In all the populations studied, one was a Chinese Uyghur population, one was a China Taiwan population, two were Japanese population and the rest are Chinese Han population. All studies had a case – control design. All controls of these studies were community-based population and in Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium. Five studies  [9,11,14 – 16]  used PCR and three studies  [10,12,13]  used TaqMan as genotyping method. The main characteristics, genotype

and allele distributions of these studies are summarized in  Tables 1 and Table 2 .  

# 3.2. Meta-analysis results  

The main results of the meta-analysis are shown in  Table 3 . No signi ﬁ cant association between SNP rs11833579 and ischemic stroke was found in all genetic models ( Table 3  and  Fig. 1 ). There were ten studies

 [9,10,12 – 16]  which classi ﬁ ed the cases according to the TOAST criteria

 [17] , while in four studies  [9,15,16]  genotyping data for large artery athero sclerosis (LAA, 1257 cases and 3439 controls) and small artery occlusion (SAO, 2869 cases and 3439 controls) could be obtained. Our metaanalysis results showed that there are no associations between SNP rs11833579 and LAA or SAO stroke. In the subgroup analysis by country, no evidence of signi ﬁ cant association was found in all genetic models.  

# 3.3. Publication bias  

Begg's funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test were performed to assess publication biases in the included studies. The shape of the funnel plot of the association between rs11833579 polymorphism and ischemic stroke did not reveal any evidence of obvious asymmetry ( Fig. 2 ). Both Begg's and Egger's test also did not indicate any statistical evidence of publication bias under all the genetic models in the overall studies (Begg's test:  ${\tt p}=0.938$   for allelic model,  ${\mathsf p}=0$  . 815 for dominant model,  ${\mathsf{p}}=0$  . 697 for recessive model, and  ${\mathsf{p}}=0.815$   for homozygote model, respectively; Egger's test:   $\mathsf{p}=0.780$   for allelic model,   ${\tt p}={\tt$  0. 829 for dominant model,   ${\mathsf{p}}=0.\,966$   for recessive model, and  ${\mathsf p}=0$  .  

937 for homozygote model, respectively) as well as in subtype analysis. Therefore, there was no evidence of publication bias in our study.  

# 4. Discussion  

In 2000 Araki et al.  [5]  identi ﬁ ed a new cell adhesion molecule, ninjurin2 encoded by the gene NINJ2. Expression of ninjurin2 is constitutive and abundant in almost all the sensory ganglion neurons and enteric neurons  [5] . Ninjurin2 is up-regulated in Schwann cells in the distal nerve segment after peripheral nerve injury, and it promotes neurite outgrowth from DRG neurons via ninjurin2-mediated homophilic cellular interaction  [5] . SNP rs11833579 located on chromosome 12p13 is near the gene NINJ2  [4] . A genome-wide association study generated from four large cohorts including 19,602 white persons con ﬁ rmed that SNP rs11833579 was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in 2009, yet the association was not replicated in another cohort of 574 black persons  [4] . To date, there have been several researches on this topic and study results were con ﬂ icting. The association between SNP rs11833579 and ischemic stroke remains unclear. Our meta-analysis result showed no evidence of association between rs11833579 and ischemic stroke in Asian populations. As far as we know, no meta-analysis concerning the association between rs11833579 and LAA or SAO stroke in Chinese populations has been previously reported. Therefore, we carried out a subgroup-analysis to further investigate the role of rs11833579 in LAA or SAO stroke, where we failed to  ﬁ nd evidence of association in Chinese populations via all genetic models with 223 cases and 345 controls. In addition, Begg's test and Egger's test indicated no publication bias in this meta

analysis. Our results agree with four other studies  [10,13,15,16]  on Chinese populations and two meta-analyses on Asian population  [18, 19] , but contradicted two other studies  [11,14] . The discrepancy may be due to the following reasons: 1) different genetic backgrounds and living environment; 2) the sample sizes were not suf ﬁ cient to obtain the same result; 3) the difference in study design (incident/ ﬁ rst-ever ischemic stroke versus prevalent stroke). There were several limitations in our analysis. Firstly, the sample sizes might not be large enough for robust testing. Secondly, all included studies were published in English or Chinese and studies published in other languages or unpublished studies might have been missed. Thirdly, only Chinese and Japanese research data were included in our analysis and further study needs more research data from other Asian countries. In conclusion, our metaanalysis shows that the SNP rs11833579 is not related to ischemic stroke in the Asian population, providing data for better understanding of the association between rs11833579 and ischemic stroke. Considering the limitations mentioned above, more studies are needed to conﬁ rm this relationship in the future.
