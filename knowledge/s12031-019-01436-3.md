# Abstract  

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) reported that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4618210 in the  PLCL2 gene is related to myocardial infarction (MI) in the Japanese population, but no study has examined the correlation of  PLCL2  with ischemic stroke (IS). The present study was designed to investigate whether the genetic variation in  PLCL2  is associated with large artery at hero sclerotic (LAA) stroke in a Han Chinese population. Tagging SNPs (tSNPs) of the  PLCL2  gene were determined by a fine-mapping strategy and were genotyped by improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technology in 669 LAA stroke patients and 668 healthy controls. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the associations between genetic variation at  PLCL2  and the risk of LAA stroke. Two SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of LAA stroke after adjusting for potential con founders: for rs4685423, the AA genotype and CA genotype decreased the risk of LAA stroke compared with the CC genotype (multivariate-adjusted,  $P=0.001$  ); for rs4618210, the AA genotype and GA genotype decreased the risk of LAA stroke compared with the GG genotype (multivariate-adjusted,  $P=0.007]$  ). In addition, haplotype analysis indicated that compared with haplotype TTT, haplotype TAT decreased the risk of LAA stroke in block 2 (adjusted OR, 0.706;  $95\%$   CI, 0.550 – 0.907;  $P=0.006\$  ). The analysis of SNP – SNP interactions showed that  $\mathrm{rs}4685423$   was the most influential contributor to LAA stroke risk. SNPs rs4685423 and rs4618210 in the  PLCL2  gene may be related to the risk of LAA stroke in Han Chinese.

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS) is a neurological deficit of sudden onset that leads to the major cause of acquired disability and the common cause of death in adults worldwide. As a heterogeneous disease, IS is a complex disease with longterm interactive effects of genetic and environmental factors (Bevan et al.  2012 ; Markus  2010a ). Studies on the twins and the family history of stroke identified that genetic variants substantially lead to stroke susceptibility (Bak et al.  2002 ; Jood et al.  2005 ). Genetic factors for IS may play a role at various levels, e.g., by modulating the susceptibility to conventional IS risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, by influencing the specific mechanisms of IS subtypes, by predisposing to arterial thrombosis or alterating coagulation pathways, by modifying tolerance to brain injury (Chauhan and Debette  2016 ; Munshi et al.  2015 ; Hassan and Markus  2000 ). For all IS, the contribution of genetics to stroke risk is approximately  $37.9\%$  , and the heritability varies markedly for different stroke subtypes (Bevan et al.  2012 ). According to the TOAST criteria, IS can be divided into large artery atherosclerotic (LAA), car dio embolism, small-artery occlusion, other etiologies, and undetermined (Adams et al.  1993 ). Previous study showed that heritability for LAA stroke is much higher than the other stroke subtypes (Bevan et al.  2012 ).  

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified that rs4618210, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the PLCL2  gene, was related to myocardial infarction (MI) in the Japanese population (Hirokawa et al.  2015 ). GWAS associated with cardiovascular phenotypes are likely to identify further associations with IS, especially with LAA stroke (Bevan et al.  2012 ). LAA stroke shares path o physiological features with MI (Drouet  2002 ); both diseases are usually caused by focal disruption of an atheromatous plaque and are characterized by occlusion thrombosis of the artery. We hypothesized that an association between the  PLCL2  gene rs4618210 polymorphism and LAA stroke may exist. Therefore, to determine the association between the  PLCL2  gene rs4618210 polymorphism and LAA stroke and to seek more susceptible loci in the  PLCL2  gene of LAA stroke, we conducted this study in a Chinese Han population.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Study Population  

Our study was approved by the ethics committees of the participating hospitals, in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent was obtained from the participants (the cases and the controls). Consecutive LAA stroke patients were recruited between October 2015 and June 2017 based on the Wenzhou Stroke Registry Program (WSRP) (Ye et al.  2015 ). The inclusion criteria for the cases were as follows: (1) first-ever LAA stroke (Adams et al. 1993 ) diagnosed  $\leq~7$   days since onset, (2) aged  $\geq\,18$  years, and (3) Chinese Han ethnicity. The controls were recruited from local inhabitants who received physical examination in hospitals during the same period and were balanced with the cases by age and sex. Inhabitants were recruited if they were aged 18 years or older, ethnically Chinese Han, without any at hero sclerotic diseases and stroke history, and free of clinically detectable cerebrovascular disease.  

The exclusion criteria for the cases and the controls included malignancies, systematic diseases, severe heart, lung, kidney or liver diseases, and he mato logic diseases.  

# DNA Isolation and Genotyping  

A total of   ${\mathsf{5}}{\mathrm{-mL}}$   venous blood was collected in EDTA (disodium salt,   $50\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$  ) tubes from the ante cubit al vein in the morning after an overnight fast and then frozen at  –  80  $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until testing was performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using a commercially available DNA isolation kit (Magen DNA Isolation Kit, China). Genotypes were determined by improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technology (Genesky) by laboratory personnel blinded to the knowledge of clinical data. A multiplex PCR-ligase detection reaction method was used in the iMLDR. For each SNP, the alleles were distinguished by different fluorescent labels of allele-specific oli go nucleotide probe pairs. Different SNPs were further distinguished by different extended lengths at the 3 ′ end. Two negative controls were set: one with double-distilled water as template and the other with DNA sample without primers while keeping all other conditions the same in one plate. The whole genotyping process was supported by the Shanghai Genesky Biotechnology Company (Shanghai, China) (Chen et al. 2014 ; Cai et al.  2016 ). For quality control, genotyping results were confirmed by randomly selecting  $5\%$   of samples for repeated genotyping, and the results were   $100\%$   concordant.  

# Fine-Mapping Strategy  

Tagging SNPs (tSNPs) of the  PLCL2  gene were determined by a fine-mapping strategy. Briefly, by utilizing the HapMap website to download the genetic information of the  PLCL2 gene and then performing the Haploview software to screen the tSNPs, based on HapMap release 27 of the merged phases III ( http://www.hapmap.org ), we identified a linkage d is equilibrium (LD) block of   $157.5\;\mathrm{k\textbar}$   (chr3: 16 949 586..17 107 089) in the  PLCL2  gene of Han Chinese. By utilizing Haploview software (version 4.0; Cambridge, USA), the fine-mapping of the tSNPs was performed to determine their probability of tagging the surrounding variants. Inclusion criteria for the selected SNPs included the following: (1) a minor allele frequency   $(\mathrm{MAF})>0.05$  , (2)    $r^{2}\,{=}\,0.8$  , (3) overall rate of genotype  $\ge75\%$  , and (4)  $P$   value for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test  $>0.05$  . The index SNP rs4618210 based on a former study was also included (Hirokawa et al. 2015 ). As a result, a total of eight SNPs (rs6769249, rs12233492, rs7616589, rs7612044, rs6789316, rs12630448, rs4685423, rs4618210) in the  PLCL2  gene were selected for genotyping (Table  1 ).  

# Statistical Analysis  

Categorical data are shown as counts and percentages and were evaluated using the chi-square test. The genotypic distributions of the selected SNPs were analyzed in controls by HWE utilizing the exact chi-square test. To evaluate the relationship between the risk of LAA IS and the selected SNPs, univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed. In logistic regression, each SNP of  PLCL2  was assessed by an additive model, a dominant model, and a recessive model. Statistical analyses were performed by using the IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 software (IBM Corporation, NY, USA). Values were deemed to be statistically significant at    $P\!<$  0.05. The Haploview software (version 4.0; Cambridge, USA)

The frequencies of the haplotypes  $<0.01$   were omitted in the haplotype analysis. The SNP – SNP interactions in the risk of LAA stroke were evaluated by utilizing the Generalized Multi factor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR) 0.7 software.  

# Results  

# Baseline Characteristics  

In the present study, a total of 669 eligible cases diagnosed with LAA stroke and 668 controls who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Genotyping was successfully performed in all of the study participants. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the cases and controls are shown in Table  2 . Both age   $(P\;=\;0.427)$  ) and sex   $~(P~=~0.930)$  ) were well matched for the cases and controls. Compared with the controls, the cases had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus   $(P<0.001)$  ), obesity   $(P=$  0.016), hypertension   $(P=0.002)$  ), dys lipid emi a   $(P=0.005)$  ), smoking   $(P=0.009)$  ), and drinking   $\left(P=0.003\right)$  ).  

# PLCL2  Gene Polymorphisms and Their Association with LAA Stroke Risk  

The genotype distributions of the  PLCL2  gene were in HWE in the controls (Table  1 ). Table  3  shows the relationship between  PLCL2  polymorphisms and the risk of LAA stroke. In the crude model, two SNPs were found to be significantly associated with the risk of LAA stroke: for rs4685423, the AA genotype (AA vs CC; OR, 0.553;   $95\%$   CI, 0.399 – 0.767;  $P<0.001]$  ) and the CA genotype (CA vs CC; OR, 0.798;  $95\%$  CI, 0.590 – 1.081;  $P=0.145)$  ) decreased the risk of LAA stroke compared with the CC genotype   $\left(P=0.001\right)$  ); for rs4618210, the AA genotype (AA vs GG; OR, 0.890;  $95\%$   CI,   $0.652\mathrm{-}$  1.217;  $P=0.467)$  ) and GA genotype (GA vs GG; OR, 0.698;  $95\%$   CI, 0.522 – 0.883;  $P=0.003\}$  ) decreased the risk of LAA stroke compared with the GG genotype   $(P=0.011)$  ). In the multivariate model, after adjusting for potential con founders, SNPs rs4685423 and rs4618210 were still significantly associated with the risk of LAA stroke (in the additive model, multivariate-adjusted,  $P=0.001$  , 0.007).  

# LD Analysis and Haplotype Block Structure

between rs6769249 and rs12233492 were found   $(r^{2}=0.87)$  ). In block 2, high allelic associations between rs6789316 and rs4685423   $(r^{2}=0.89)$   and rs12630448 and rs4685423   $(r^{2}=$  0.95) were found. In the haplotype analysis, to reduce the potential false positives, haplotypes with frequencies  $<$  0.01 were omitted. After adjusting for potential variables, in block 2, the TAT haplotype (OR, 0.706;   $95\%$   CI,   $0.550-$  0.907) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of LAA stroke when compared with the TTT haplotype (Table  4 ).  

# SNP – SNP Interactions  

GMDR was performed to analyze the eight tag SNPs in the PLCL2  gene. The results of the analysis of the interactions between the eight tag SNPs and the risk of LAA stroke are summarized in Table  5 . In the single-locus model, after adjusting for sex, age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dys lipid emi a, smoking, and drinking, the most influential attributor for the risk of LAA stroke was rs4685423, with a cross-validation consistency (CVC) of 9/10 and a testing accuracy (TA) of 0.5271, which was consistent with the results of previous logistic analysis.  

# Discussion  

In the present hospital-based case-control study, we comprehensively evaluated the relationship of eight fine-mappingsupported  PLCL2  gene SNPs with the risk of LAA stroke in the Chinese Han population, and we observed a significant association between the  PLCL2  rs4685423 and rs4618210 polymorphisms and the risk of LAA stroke. Further, haplotype analysis showed that the haplotype TAT in block 2 decreased the LAA stroke risk compared with the haplotype TTT, and SNP – SNP interaction analysis showed that rs4685423 was the most influential attributor for the LAA stroke risk.

When a blood vessel is blocked and the blood flow to a region of the brain is interrupted, IS occurs. It is a heterogeneous disease consisting of multiple subtypes. Although diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation are known risk factors for IS, a large proportion of the risk remains unexplained and might be due to genetic influences (Dichgans  2007 ; Falcone et al.  2014 ; Meschia et al. 2014 ). Genetic predisposition may vary according to the different IS subtypes (Markus  2010b ; Greta rs do ttir et al.  2008 ; G schw end t ner et al.  2009 ; Lemmens et al.  2010 ) and ignoring e tio logical differences might lead to conflicting results. Uncovering the genetic variants related to different subtypes is important for the development of improved diagnostic tests and novel therapies that may reduce the burden of IS.  

As a novel ph os ph o lipase C-like protein, PLCL2 lacks ph os ph o lipase catalytic activity (Otsuki et al.  1999 ) and is a negative regulator of B cell receptor signaling and immune responses (Takenaka et al.  2003 ). The  PLCL2  gene is located on chromosome  $3{\mathfrak{p}}24.3$   and has been identified as a new susce pti bil it y locus for MI in a GWAS (Hirokawa et al.  2015 ).  

Previous studies showed that the location of the  PLCL2  region was associated with psoriasis (Tsoi et al.  2015 ) and multiple sclerosis (Sawcer et al.  2011 ), pointing to a functional role of PLCL2 in the immune system. Because immune cells, including B cells, Tcells, macrophages, and neutrophils, regulate the a the rogen ic process (Lahoute et al.  2011 ; Libby  2012 ).  

In the present study, we found that the  PLCL2  rs4618210 variant was related with the susceptibility of LAA stroke. This finding is in agreement with previous GWAS on MI in the Japanese population (Hirokawa et al.  2015 ). Of interest, we also identified a novel SNP (rs4685423) in the  PLCL2  gene associated with LAA stroke. Little data are available on the PLCL2  gene as an indicator of LAA stroke. As far as we know, this is the first study on the relationship between the PLCL2  gene and genetic heritability of LAA stroke. We speculate that SNPs rs4685423 and rs4618210 of the  PLCL2  gene may influence the PLCL2 serum level and then influence the regulation of the maturation of B cells, leading to atherosclerotic lesion formation and thus involved in the pathogen es is of the chronic inflammatory process of LAA stroke (Perry et al. 2012 ). However, this is an observation that should be

confirmed by additional functional experiments to further increase our understanding of the role of  PLCL2  in LAA stroke.  

The potential limitations of our study warrant consideration. First, in the controls, we did not exclude participants with a family history of cardiovascular disease or stroke who might have higher frequencies of genotypes related to cardiovascular disease or stroke, which might increase the likelihood of type II error. Second, we provided evidence of a relationship between the  PLCL2  gene polymorphisms and LAA stroke risk. However, the molecular and biological mechanisms underlying the genetic association remain unclear, and functional studies are warranted to establish how the genotypes affect LAA stroke.  

In conclusion, our findings support the existence of an association between rs4685423 and rs4618210 in the  PLCL2 gene and the risk of developing LAA stroke in a Chinese Han population. In particular, individuals carrying the rs4685423 A allele and/or rs4618210 A allele of the  PLCL2  gene may have a decreased risk of developing LAA stroke. The results may provide clues for the evaluation of individual sus ce pti bility to LAA stroke and may serve in the development of effective prevention strategies.
