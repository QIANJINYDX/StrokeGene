# Abstract  

Background : The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 4 gene ( TIMD4 ) rs6882076 single nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and  triglycerides (TG) levels, but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, little is known about such association in  Chinese populations. The aim of this study was to detect the association of the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP and  serum lipid levels and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke (IS) in a Southern Chinese  Han population.  

Methods : Genotypes of the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP in 1765 unrelated subjects (CHD, 581; IS, 559 and healthy  controls, 625) were determined by the Snapshot Technology.  

Results : The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP were different between the  CHD/IS patients and controls   $(P<0.05\$   for all). The subjects with CT/TT genotypes were associated with  decreased risk of CHD   $(P=0.014\$   for CT/TT  vs . CC genotypes,  $P=0.010$   for T  vs . C alleles) and IS (  $\bar{P}=0.003$    for CT/TT  vs . CC genotypes;  $P=0.016$   for T  vs . C alleles). The T allele carriers in healthy controls were also  associated with decreased levels of serum TG.  

Conclusions : The results of the present study suggest that the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP is associated with  decreased risk of CHD and IS in our study population. It is likely to decrease the CHD and IS risk by reducing  serum TG levels.

# Introduction  

Coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic  stroke (IS) remain the leading causes of morbidity and  mortality worldwide [1, 2]. More than 700,000 people  die from CHD each year in China [3]. The major  pathological basis of two diseases had been proved to  be atherosclerosis which the essential as an ambitious  inflammatory disorder. Therefore, both of diseases  would be involved in the same genetic and  environmental backgrounds, including gender, time  to life, hyper cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes,  cigarette smoking, and genetic factors [4-6]. Twin and  family studies have indicated that the heritable factors  account for   $30\%{-}60\%$   of the inter individual variation  in the risk of CHD and IS [7]. Recently, a large number  of genes and loci related with CHD [8] or IS [9] were  reported in several genome-wide association studies  (GWASes). In addition, some genetic variants that  initially association with CHD were detected to be  related to IS afterwards [10, 11].  

The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 4  gene ( TIMD4 , also known as T-cell membrane protein  4,  TIM-4 ) is located on chromosome 5q33.3.  TIMD4  is  exclusively expressed in antigen-presenting cells,  where it mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and  plays an important role in maintaining tolerance [12].  Blockade  of  TIMD4  enhanced  the  risk  of  atherosclerosis in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)  receptor-deficient mice [13]. GWASes and other  studies performed in different populations have  reported that the  TIMD4  variants were associated  with serum lipid traits, but the findings are  inconsistent [14-18]. In addition, little is known about  the association of the  TIMD4  SNPs and the risk of  CHD and IS. Therefore, in the current study, we  aimed to detect the association of the  TIMD4 rs6882076 SNP and serum lipid levels and the  susceptibility of CHD and IS in a Southern Chinese  Han population.  

# Methods  

# Study  P atients  

A total of 1140 unrelated patients were recruited  from the hospitalized patients who were treated in the  First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University.  Among them, 581 subjects suffered from CHD, and  another 559 patients were diagnosed with IS. CHD  was defined as including typical ischemic symptoms,  plus one or more electrocardiograph ic changes  (ST-segment depression or elevation of   $\geq\;0.5\;\mathrm{\mum},$  ,  T-wave inversion  ${\mathrm{of}}\geq3\,{\mathrm{mm}}\,{\mathrm{in}}\geq3$   leads, or left bundle  branch block), in addition to increases in cardiac  markers, such as creatinine kinase-MB and troponin  T. Coronary angiography was carried out in patients  with CHD. For the independent ang io graph ers, two  were blinded to the results of the genotypes. When  coronary angiograms were performed, they were  observed carefully. For a vessel to be scored, stenosis   $\ge50\%$   had to be noted in an epicardial coronary vessel  of interest or in one of its major branches. In the event  of disc or dance of the number of vessels scored  between the two reviewers, a third independent  reviewer scored angiograms. The CHD subjects could  be chosen for to our study when significant coronary  stenosis   $(\geq50\%)$   was observed in at least one of the  three main coronary arteries or their major branches  (branch diameter   $\ge\mathrm{~\mathsf~{~2~}~}\mathrm{mm}$  ). In addition, the  ang io graphic severity of disease was classified  according to the number of coronary vessels with  significant stenosis (luminal narrowing   $\ge~50\%$  ) as  one-, two-, or three-vessel disease in the three major  coronary arteries [15, 19]. The definition of IS was  ensured in accordance with the Trial of   $\mathrm{Arg}\,10172$   in  Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria [20] after  rigorous examination, including neurological test,  computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI). The IS patients entered in the study  included individuals who were eligible for one of the  two  subtypes  of  TOAST  criteria:  large-artery  atherosclerosis and small-vessel occlusion. However,  if the subjects had a confirmed diagnosis of the below  diseases, he/she must be excluded from our study: a  history of he mato logic or brain MRI revealing  cerebral hemorrhage, cardio embolic stroke or  unspecified stroke, neoplastic or intra cranial space-occupying lesion, infection, other types of intra cranial  lesions, type 1 diabetes, and renal, liver, thyroid, and  autoimmune diseases. The selected IS patients who  had a past history of CHD or CHD patients had a past  history of IS were excluded from the study.  

# Control Subjects  

A total of 622 control subjects matched by age,  gender, and ethnic group were randomly selected  from the healthy adults who underwent periodical  medical check-up at the Physical Examination Center  of the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical  University during the same period when CHD and IS  patients were recruited. The controls were healthy,  without any CHD and IS details by questionnaires,  history-taking,  and  clinical  examination.  The  examination must be covered lots of items, just as  physical  examination,  blood  sampling,  electrocardiograph y,  chest  X-ray,  and  Doppler  echo car dio graph y. All enrolled individuals were Han  Chinese from Guangxi, the People’s Republic of  China. Trained research staff collected information on  demography, socioeconomic status, medical history,  and lifestyle factors with standardized questionnaires  for all participants. All procedures of the investigation  were carried out following the rules of the Declaration  of Helsinki of 1975 (http://www.wma.net/en/  30 publications/10policies/b3/), revised in 2008. The  study design was approved by the Ethics Committee  of the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical  University (number: Lunshen-2011-KY-Guoji-001; 7  March 2011). Informed consent was obtained from all  participants before the study.  

# Biochemical Measurements  

A fasting venous blood sample of   $5\,\mathrm{\milde{l}}$   was  obtained from the participants. A part of the sample (2  mL) was collected into glass tubes and used to  determine serum lipid levels. Another part of the  sample   $(3\ \mathrm{~mL})$   was transferred to tubes with  anticoagulant s   $(4.80\:\mathrm{g/~L}$   citric acid,   $14.70\;\mathrm{g/L}$   glucose  and   $13.20~\mathrm{g/L}$   trisodium citrate) and used to extract  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Measurements of  serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG),  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in  the samples were performed by enzymatic methods  with  commercially  available  kits  (RANDOX  Laboratories Ltd., Ardmore, Diamond Road, and  Crumlin Co. Antrim, United Kingdom, BT29 4QY;  Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).  Serum apo lipoprotein (Apo) A1 and ApoB levels were  detected by the immuno turbid i metric immuno as say  using a commercial kit (RANDOX Laboratories Ltd.).  All determinations were performed with an auto-analyzer (Type 7170A; Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in  the Clinical Science Experiment Center of the First  Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University [21,  22].  

# Genotyping  

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral  blood  leukocytes  using  the  phenol-chloroform  method [23-25]. Genotyping of the  TIMD4  rs6882076  SNP was performed by the Snapshot technology  platform in the Center for Human Genetics Research,  Shanghai Genesky Bio-Tech Co. Ltd., China [23-26].  The restriction enzyme for the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP  was SAP (Promega) and Exon ucl easel (Epicentre).  The  sense  and  antisense  primers  were  5'-TG A CCG GAC CCA GG A GTC T GT $\cdot3^{\prime}$   and 5'-TCAC  CA G GAGA AAA GG GC TC AG-3', respectively.  

# Diagnostic Criteria  

The normal values of serum TC, TG, HDL-C,  LDL-C, ApoA1, ApoB levels and the ApoA1/ApoB  ratio in our Clinical Science Experiment Center were 

 3.10-5.17, 0.56-1.70, 0.91-1.81,   $2.70{-}3.20\ \ \mathrm{\mmol/L};$  1.00-1.78,   $0.63{\mathrm{-}}1.14~\mathrm{g/L};$   and 1.00-2.50; respectively 

 [27-31]. The individuals with   $\mathrm{TC}\;>\;5.17\;\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L}$  and/or   $\mathrm{LG}\ \ >\ \ 1.70\ \ \mathrm{mmol/L}$   were defined as  hyper lipid emi c [27-31]. Hypertension was defined  according to the criteria outlined by the 1999 World  Health  Organization-International  Society  of  Hypertension Guidelines for the management of  hypertension [32, 33]. Uncontrolled hypertension was  defined as a systolic blood pressure of   $140\ \mathrm{mmHg}$   or  higher and/or a diastolic blood pressure of   $90\:\mathrm{mmHg}$  or higher. Normal weight, overweight and obesity  were defined as a body mass index   $({\mathrm{BMI}})<24,24{-}28,$  ,  and  $>28\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2};$  ; respectively [34, 35].  

# Statistical Analyses  

The statistical analyses were performed with the  statistical software package SPSS 24.0 (SPSS Inc.,  Chicago, Illinois). The quantitative variables were  presented as mean   $\pm$  standard deviation (serum TG  levels were presented as medians and interquartile  ranges), qualitative variables were expressed as  percentages. Allelic frequency was determined via  direct counting, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  was verified with the standard goodness-of-fit test.  The sex ratio and genotypic distribution between the  two groups were analyzed by the chi-square test.  General characteristics between patients and controls  were compared by the Student’s unpaired  t -test. The  association between genotypes and serum lipid  parameters was tested by covariance analysis  (ANCOVA). Unconditional logistic regression was  used to assess the correlation between the risk of CHD  or IS and genotypes. Gender, age, BMI, blood  pressure, alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking  were adjusted for the statistical analysis. Odds ratio  (OR) and  $95\%$   confidence interval (CI) were calculated  by  using  unconditional  logistic  regression.  A  two-tailed   $P$   value less than 0.05 was considered  statistically significant.  

# Results  

# General Characteristics and Serum Lipid  Levels  

The general characteristics of the patients and  healthy controls are summarized in Table 1. The male  to female ratio, mean age, serum LDL-C and ApoB  levels were not different between the control and  experimental groups   $(P~>~0.05$  for all). The body  height, weight, the values of BMI, the percentage of  cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, pulse  pressure, TG and the prevalence of hypertension were  higher, but diastolic blood pressure, TC, HDL-C,  ApoA1, the ratio of ApoA1 to ApoB and the  percentage of alcohol consumption were lower in  CHD patients than in controls   $(P\,<\,0.05)$  . The body  height, weight, the values of BMI, the percentage of  cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, diastolic  blood pressure, pulse pressure, TG, and the  prevalence of hypertension were higher, whereas  those of TC, HDL-C, ApoA1, the ratio of ApoA1 to  ApoB and the percentage of alcohol consumption  were lower in IS patients than in controls   $(P<0.05)$  .  

# Genotypic and Allelic Frequencies  

The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the  rs6882076 SNP are presented in Table 2. The  genotypic and allelic frequencies were different  between the CHD/ IS and control groups   $(P<0.05)$  .  The C and   $\mathrm{T}$   allele frequencies were   $74.7\%$   and   $25.3\%$  in controls,   $70.1\%$   and   $29.9\%$   in CHD, and   $70.3\%$   and   $29.7\%$   in IS patients; respectively. The CC, CT and TT  genotype frequencies were   $57.6\%$  ,   $34.2\%$   and   $8.2\%$   in  controls;   $49.6\%$  ,   $41.0\%$   and   $9.5\%$   in CHD; and   $50.1\%$  ,   $40.4\%$   and   $9.5\%$   in IS patients; respectively. The  genotypic distribution was in accordance with the  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the three groups (  $\mathit{(P>}$  0.05).

CHD, coronary heart disease; IS, ischemic stroke; TC, total cholesterol; TG,  triglyceride; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C, low- density  lipoprotein cholesterol; ApoA1, apo lipoprotein A1; ApoB, apo lipoprotein B;  ApoA1/ApoB, the ratio of apo lipoprotein A1 to apo lipoprotein B;  P CHD : CHD  vs control;  $P_{\mathrm{IS}}$   IS  vs . control. The value of triglyceride was presented as median  (interquartile range); the difference between CHD/IS patients and controls was  determined by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The remaining characteristics  between patients and controls were tested by the Student’s unpaired  t -test.  

# TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP and the Risk of CHD or  IS  

The T allele carriers had a decreased risk of CHD  and IS (CHD:  $\mathrm{OR}=0.73$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.57{-}0.94$  ,  $P=0.014$  for CT/TT  vs . CC genotypes;   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,0.79}$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=$  0.66-0.94,   $P=0.010$   for   $\mathrm{T}$    vs . C alleles; IS:   ${\mathrm{OR}}=0.65,$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}~=~0.50–0.86,$     $P~=~0.003$   for CT/TT  vs . CC  genotypes;   $\mathrm{OR}=0.80,$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.67{-}0.96,$  ,  $P=0.016$   for  T  vs . C alleles; Table 2) after adjusting for age, gender,  BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption and  hypertension.  

# Genotype and the Risk of CHD or IS  

Stratified analysis showed a decreased risk of  CHD in subjects with the CT/TT genotypes, mainly in  those who belonged to one of the following  subgroups: males (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}~=~0.60,}$     $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\ =$  0.45–0.80,   $P\,=\,0.001)$  , age   $\leq\,60$   years (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=$  0.59,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.41{-}0.85$  ,   $P=0.019)$  ),   $\mathrm{BM}\geq24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.52,$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.34–0.79$  ,   $P\,=\,0.002)$  ),  nonsmoking (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.76$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.54–1.08$  ,   $P=0.018)$  , and non drinking (adjusted   ${\mathrm{OR}}=0.72,$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.54–0.98,$  ,  $P=0.037)$  .  

There was a decreased risk of IS in subjects with  the CT/TT genotypes, mainly in those who belonged  to one of the following subgroups: males (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,0.58}$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.43–0.77$  ,   $P\,=\,0.000)$  , age   $\leq\,60$    years (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,0.60,}$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.42–0.85$  ,   $P\,=$   

 0.005),   $\mathrm{BM}\geq24\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.60,$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=$  0.39-0.91,   $P=0.046\$  ), nonsmoking (adjusted   ${\mathrm{OR=}}0.66,$     $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}~=~0.48{-}0.90,$     $P~=~0.010)$   and non drinking 

 (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,0.69}$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.47{\cdot}1.03,$  ,   $P\,=\,0.018_{!}$  ) 

 (Table 3). No significant interaction was detected  between the genotypes and these factors.  

# Related Risk Factors for CHD and IS  

As shown in Table 4, multivariate logistic  analysis showed that the incidence of CHD and IS was  positively correlated with alcohol consumption, high  BMI   $\begin{array}{r l r}{(\geq\,}&{{}24}&{\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}).}\end{array}$  ,  CT/TT  genotypes  and  hyper lipid emi a, whereas it was negatively associated  between the incidence of CHD and hypertension, but  not between the incidence of IS and hypertension.  There was also a positive association between the  incidence of CHD and cigarette smoking, but not  between the incidence of IS and cigarette smoking.

# Genotypes and Serum Lipid Levels  

As shown in Table 5, serum TG levels were  different between the CC and CT/TT genotypes in the  controls   $(P~=~0.011)$  ), but not in the CHD and IS  patients. The   $\mathrm{T}$  allele carriers (CT/TT genotypes) in  controls had lower serum TG levels than the T allele  non-carriers  (CC  genotypes).  No  significant  differences in the remaining serum lipid parameters  between the CC and CT/TT genotypes   $P>0.05$   for  all) were found.  

# Discussion  

Serum  TG  levels  in  at hero sclerotic  cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) have been renewed  on the basis of evidence from epidemiologic, genetic,  and clinical studies. Epidemiologic studies have  shown that increased TG levels are correlated with an  increased risk of cardiovascular diseases [36, 37] and  the American Heart Association has long recognized  that increased TGs are an important marker of  cardiovascular risk [38]. More recently studies have  shown in GWASes [16, 38-41], genetic [42-47] and  mendelian random iz ation [48-50] that have suggested  a causal role for TGs as a modifiable risk factor in the  development and progression of ASCVD. Analyses  from clinical data have demonstrated that lower  on-treatment  TGs  correlate  with  reduced    cardiovascular risk [51, 52]. The real-world analysis of  administratively derived data from  $>20\;000$  patients  in  the  Optum  Research  Database  identified  statin-treated patients with high TGs and a diagnosis  of diabetes mellitus and/or ASCVD to be at a   $34.9\%$  higher risk of major cardiovascular events than a  comparator cohort of patients with TGs   $<\ \ 1.69$  mmol/L   $(<150~\mathrm{mg/DL})$  ) and   $\mathrm{HDL-C>1.04\ m m o l/L}$   $\begin{array}{r l r l}{(>\ }&{{}40}&{\ \mathrm{mg/DL})}\end{array}$  while  controlling  for  other  com or bidi ties. Reflective of the higher risk of major  cardiovascular events, high TGs (  $2.26{-}5.64\ \mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L})$  were also associated with significantly higher medical  costs and resource use. This is consistent with a prior  observational analysis that found TGs in the range  2.26 to   $5.64\ \mathrm{\mmol/L}$   to be associated with  significantly higher total medical costs than in  patients with   $\mathrm{TGS}<1.69$   (  $(P<0.001)$   [53].  

The prevalence of the  TIMD4  rs6882076T allele  may be different in diverse racial/ethnic groups. The  information in the International HapMap Project’s  database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/  tools/1000 genomes/) showed that the rs6882076T  allele frequency was   $31.5\%$   in Europeans,   $24.4\%$   in  Han Chinese in Beijing (HCB),   $15.9\%$   in Japanese, and   $68.3\%$   in Sub-Saharan African. In the present study,  we showed that the  TIMD4  rs6882076T allele  frequency was lower in our study subjects (control,   $8.2\%$  ; CHD,   $9.5\%$  ; and IS,   $9.5\%$  ) than in HCB   $(24.4\%)$  .  The reason for these differences is not well known, a  reasonable  explanation  is  different  genetic  background between the HCB and Han Chinese in  Guangxi. These inconsistent results, however, also  suggest that the prevalence of the  TIMD4  rs6882076  variation may have a racial/ethnic specificity. The  prevalence of the rs6882076T allele was higher in  Europeans or in African than in Asian. All of these  findings would be a reasonable explanation for the  distinct prevalence of CHD between European or  African and Chinese.

TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; ApoA1, apo lipoprotein A1; ApoB,  apo lipoprotein B. The value of triglyceride was presented as median (interquartile range), and the difference between the two genotype subgroups was determined by the  Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The association of genotypes and the remaining serum lipid parameters was tested by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  

Another important finding in the current study  was that the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP was strongly  associated with the risk of CHD and IS in the Guangxi  Han population. The CT/TT genotypes and T allele  were associated with a decreased risk of CHD and IS  after adjusting for potential confounding factors.  Multivariate analysis showed that the known factors,  such as cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, high  BMI   $(\geq\,24~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$  , hyper lipid emi a and the CT/TT  genotypes were dependent ly associated with CHD.  Meanwhile, the occurrence of IS was positively  correlated with alcohol consumption, high BMI   $(\geq24$   $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$  , hypertension, hyper lipid emi a and the CT/TT  genotypes. CHD was negatively correlated with  hypertension and IS was negatively correlated with  cigarette smoking. In the stratified analysis, the  decreased risk of CHD and IS in subjects with the CT  and TT genotypes was mainly observed in males, age   $\le~60$  years,   $\mathrm{BM}\ \geq\ 24\ \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2},$  , nonsmokers and  nondrinkers. No significant interactions between the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP and environmental factors on  the risk of CHD or IS. The subjects with CT/TT  genotypes of the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP contributed to  the decreased risk of CHD and IS.   In a previous study,  we have reported that two  TIMD4-HAVCR1  SNPs  (rs1501918 and rs2036402) interacted with alcohol  consumption to influence serum HDL-C levels. Two  SNPs (rs1501918 and rs12522248) interacted with BMI     $\geq~24~\mathrm{\bf~kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  to modulate serum TC levels. The  haplotypes of G-T-T and C-C-C interacted with  smoking to increase the risk of CHD. The haplotypes  of C-T-T, G-T-T, C-C-C, and G-C-T in  $\mathrm{BM}\geq24\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  were associated with an increased risk for CHD and  IS. The rs 12522248 TC/CC genotypes interacted with     $\mathrm{BM}\geq24\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  to increase the risk of CHD. It is well  known that heavy alcohol intake, smoking and  obesity have an unfavourable effect on lipid profiles  and at hero sclerotic disease [18].  

Several previous studies have reported the  association of many SNPs in the  TIMD4  with one or  more lipid traits [24, 27-29]. However, not all  researches have consistent findings. A previous  GWAS showed that the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP was  associated with LDL-C [17]. In the present study, we  found that the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP was only  associated with serum TG levels. The genotypic and  allelic frequencies of the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP were  different between the CHD/IS patients and controls   $(P<0.05\$   for all). The CT/TT genotypes and   $\mathrm{T}$   allele  were associated with a decreased risk of CHD   $(P\,=$  0.014 for CT/TT  vs . CC,  $P=0.010$   for T  vs . C) and IS (  ${'}P$   $=0.003$   for CT/TT  vs . CC;   $P=0.016$   for T  vs . C). The  CT/TT genotypes in the healthy controls, but not in  CHD or IS patients, were also associated with a  decreased serum TG concentration. It may be owing  to the impact of other uncertain variants and the  different genetic background, lifestyle and diet in  different ethnic groups. Another possible reason is  that the sample size may not be enough to detect the  exact association. Therefore, further investigations  with larger sample size are needed to confirm our  findings.  

Several potential limitations cannot be ignored.  Firstly, the number of involved patients was relatively  small compared to many previous GWASes and  replication studies. With these situations, larger  sample numbers are needed to determine the  consequences  in  future  studies.  Significant  distinctions  from  demography  were  observed  between the control and patient groups. For the sake  of statistical analysis accuracy, we adjusted for several  environmental exposures, including time to life, sex,  BMI, cigarette smoking, and alcohol drinking, but the  potential influence of these factors on serum lipid  concentrations and the risk of CHD and IS could not  be completely eliminated. Secondly, a number of  patients in CHD or IS groups took anti-at hero sclerotic  drugs, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aspirin when they were  enrolled in the study, but not in the control group.  However, the drug information was missing for some  IS and CHD patients. It was not proper to analyze the  association of the SNP and serum lipid levels in the  CHD and IS groups. Finally, only one  TIMD4  SNP  was studied in this study. Therefore, the observed  associations need further replications to avoid  spurious associations.  

# Conclusions  

The  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP was associated with  serum TG levels and the susceptibility of CHD and IS  in a Southern Chinese Han population. The T allele  carriers had a decreased risk of CHD and IS. The T  allele carriers in healthy controls had lower serum TG  levels than the T allele non-carriers. These findings  suggest that the  TIMD4  rs6882076 SNP is likely to  decrease the risk of CHD and IS by reducing serum  TG levels.
