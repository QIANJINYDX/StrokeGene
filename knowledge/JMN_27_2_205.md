# Abstract  

A direct role of lymph o toxin ${\bf\nabla}\alpha$   ( LTA ) in promoting at hero sclerotic plaque growth has been demonstrated recently. The different protein transcripts of the naturally occurring genetic variants of the LTA gene have been demonstrated to exhibit affected functions, and an allelic difference in binding to transcription factor(s) has also been suggested. The homozygous variant of LTA characterized by the intron  $\bar{1\bar{2}}52\mathrm{A}{\rightarrow}\mathrm{G}$   (252G) transition, which naturally coexists with an exon   $3\ 804C{\rightarrow}\mathrm{A}$   (804A) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), has been reported as a susceptibility gene for myocardial infarction. Because the at hero sclerotic process is also an integral component in the pathogen es is of certain types of vascular stroke, we investigated the possible significance of the above SNPs in 353 ischemic stroke patients and 180 healthy controls. The homozygous  LTA allele  with the 252G and 804C SNPs occurred more frequently in stroke patients   $(13.9\%)$   than in controls   $(7.20\%$  ,  $p<0.025)$  ). Specific sub classification of the patients revealed an accumulation of these SNPs in large-vessel, pathology-associated cerebral infarction   $(18.2\%)$  ; multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data confirmed this association, with an odds ratio of 2.1 (  $95\%$   confidence interval,  $1.3–6.2;p<0.005)$  . Elimination of all subjects with a history or evidence of ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction, did not affect this association. These data show that besides the role in the development of myocardial infarction, the homozygous carriage of the  LTA allele with 252G and 804A SNPs is a novel susceptibility factor for large vessel associated ischemic stroke.

# Introduction  

A growing body of evidence suggests that lymph o toxinα  (LTA) is the predominant memberof the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family, which elicits pro a the rogen ic responses (Schreyer et al., 2002). Lymph o toxinα (LTA) can induce adhesion molecules and cytokines from vascular endo the li al, vascular smooth muscle cells and certain types of leukocytes; these substances are expressed in at hero sclerotic  

plaques, and their levels in circulation are elevated in atherosclerosis and coronary artery diseases, including myocardial infarction (O’Brien et al., 1996; Squadrito et al., 1996; Belch et al., 1997; Hwang et al., 1997; Morisaki et al., 1997). Functional single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  LTA gene have been reported recently as factors causing a susce pti bil it y to myocardial infarction (Ozaki et al., 2002). Among these functional SNPs, the intron   $1\,252\mathrm{A}{\rightarrow}\mathrm{G}$  (252G) haplotype, which coexists with an exon 3  $804C{\rightarrow}\mathrm{A}$   (804A) variant (Messer et al., 1991; Ozaki et al., 2002), has been reported to enhance the transcriptional level of synthesized LTA; and this haplotype is more tightly bound to certain unidentified nuclear factor(s), which are probably transcription factor(s) (Ozaki et al., 2002). The presence of these SNPs therefore could be postulated as ultimately promoting at hero genetic processes in general.  

Significant efforts currently are being devoted to identification of the unfavorable gene polymorphisms, which as independent e tio logical factors, can give rise to the development of ischemic stroke (Hassan and Markus, 2000; Szolnoki et al., 2002, 2003a, 2003b). In this context, the LTA 252G SNP recently has been studied in a mixed population of ischemic stroke patients (Pessin et al., 1979). The aim of the present case–control association study was to investigate the distribution of LTA 252G and 804C SNPs in an extended approach; the stroke patients were sub classified with regard to the consideration that the LTA functional SNPs might have different levels of significance in the different vascular types of ischemic stroke.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Study Population  

A total of 353 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who had never suffered a previous stroke event were included in the study. All of these subjects underwent a detailed clinical scrutiny, including exploration of medical history, evaluation of vascular risk factors, general physical and neurological examinations, urine analysis, extended laboratory examinations, electrocardiograph y, extra cranial and trans cranial Doppler sonography of brain-supplying arteries, trans thoracic and/or trans esophageal echo car dio graph y where appropriate, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations within  $2\,\mathrm{d}$   after the first observation of the symptoms. The MRIs were produced with a 0.23- Tesla resistive magnet (Picker, Outlook, Finland), with the use of a head coil. The infarction s were evaluated in the axial and coronal views of the relaxation time 2 (T2), relaxation time 1 (T1), and proton density-weighted images. All scans were read by an experienced investigator without knowledge of the clinical and laboratory data. Following evaluation of radiological features, the patients were enrolled into three subgroups. Group 1 corresponded to small-vessel occlusion (one or more sub cortical hemispheric or brain-stem infarcts with a diameter of  ${<}1.5$  cm on the MRIs), whereas group 2 corresponded to large-vessel infarction (cortical or cerebellar lesions and/or brain-stem infarcts or sub cortical hemispheric infarcts  ${\tt>}1.5~\mathrm{cm}$   in diameter on the MRIs); group 3 corresponded to a mixed vascular pathology (one or more lacunar and large-vessel infarcts on the MRIs). The study design was prospective; the patients were enrolled immediately after the clinical neurological and MRI examinations. Subjects on whom MRIs could not be recorded or for whom the examined clinical parameters and risk factors could not be obtained with certainty, in consequence of some technical cause or death, were excluded from the study group.  

As a control group, 180 stroke and neuro imaging alteration-free Caucasian Hungarian subjects were examined. The controls were selected randomly by using a sex-matched technique from general practice registers from the same locality as the cases, with the requirement that they had negative brain MRI or computed tomography (CT) findings. They were healthy and believed free of cerebro vascular disease. Subjects with any kind of previous clinical data suggesting a cerebro vascular or cardiovascular event (such as transitory ischemic attacks or angina pectoris) were excluded from the control group.  

# Assessment of Clinical Data  

Smoking and drinking habits and the presence of hypertension or diabetes mellitus were recorded for all participants. Serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels were also measured and analyzed as important clinical parameters. Hypertension was diagnosed when blood pressure repeatedly exceeded  $140\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   systolic and/or  $90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   diastolic when the patient was taking anti hypertensive medication. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed when the glucose level was at least   $7.78\ \mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L}$   in a fasting state and/or at least   $11.11\,\mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{L}\,2\,\mathrm{h}$   after a meal or  $75\:\mathrm{g}$  oral glucose loading, according to World Health Organization criteria (1985). The data on hypertension and diabetes mellitus were obtained from the medical histories of patients or at least 2 wk after the stroke event. Ischemic heart disease was diagnosed when a history of angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction was present or if there was electro car diogram evidence of coronary heart disease.  

Patients were classified as smokers if they smoked more than five cigarettes per day for at least a year. Patients were considered to be moderately heavy drinkers if they drank   $40\;\mathrm{g}$   of alcohol or more per day. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.  

Both controls and patients gave their informed consent to the clinical workup and the DNA analysis. The study design was approved in advance by the local Ethics Committee.  

# DNA Analysis  

DNAwas isolated from peripheral blood by a standard desalting method (Miller et al., 1988).  

We examined two SNPs in the  LTA gene (GeneBank access no. NT_007592): A252G in intron 1 and C804A in exon 3, in separate PCR restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP)-based assays. For the LTA 252G site, primers   $5^{\prime}$  -CCTTGGT GG G TTT G GT TTT GG TTT   $C–3^{\prime}$   and   $5^{\prime}$  -AAGAGAC G TTC AG GT GG TG C CATGG $\cdot3^{\prime}$  were used. The reverse primer contained a false base (boldface letter) to create an artificial obligatory NcoI recognition site (underlined). The PCR was carried out in a final volume of   $50~\upmu\mathrm{L},$  , which contained   $200~\upmu M$   each dNTPs,   $1\;\mathrm{m}M\;\mathrm{MgCl}_{2},$   2 units of  Taq  polymerase, 5  $\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of reaction buffer (  $100~\mathrm{m}M$   Tris-HCl at   $\mathrm{pH}\ 9.0,$  , containing  $500\,\mathrm{m}M\,\mathrm{KCl}$   and  $15\,\mathrm{m}M\,\mathrm{MgCl_{2}}$  ),  $0.2\,\upmu M$  each primers, and   $1\;\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of DNA. The reaction was performed for a total of 35 cycles with the use of an MJ Research PTC-200 thermal cycler. The cycling conditions were as follows: pre de natura tion for 5 min at   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  , de natura tion for  $30~\mathrm{s}$   at   $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$   anneal- ing for 30 s at  $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  , primer extension for 30 s at  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  and final extension at  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 7 min. The PCR amplification resulted in a 323-bp product. After the wildtype sequence (AA) was subjected to the NcoI restriction enzyme, the digestion resulted in 24- and 210-bp-long bands, whereas in homozygotes (GG), 24-, 89-, and 299-bp products were formed.  

For the LTA 804A locus, the primers were   $5^{\prime}$  - T CT GTC TTC CGC CGC GT G   $C–3^{\prime}$   and   $5^{\prime}$  -ATGAG- GT GAG CA GC A GG TTT GA C G-  $3^{\prime}$  . Similar to the former assay, the reverse primer contained a false base (boldface letter) to create an artificial TaiI recognition site (underlined) for the 804 A variant. The PCR conditions were the same as described above. In the wild-type sequence (CC), the digestion resulted in 91- and 272-bp products, whereas in homozygotes (AA), 22-, 91-, and 250-bp digestion products were formed.  

Both of the RFLP assays were constructed so as to enclose an obligatory cleaving site to ensure appropriate technical control of the effectiveness of the digestion.  

# Statistical Analysis  

The differences between the clinical parameters in the stroke groups and controls were assessed by using the   $\chi^{2}$    test or the Mann-Whitney test, where appropriate. The stroke groups were tested versus the control group for the frequencies of the different genotypes by the   $\chi^{2}$    test. Odds ratios (ORs) derived from logistic regression were also used to determine whether the presence of the significant genotypes was associated with an increased risk of stroke after adjustment for differences in age, sex, serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, ischemic heart disease, and drinking habits. For all the ORs, the  $95\%$   confidence interval   $95\%$   CI) was calculated. Logistic regression analyses were performed with the statistical package Systat 10 for Windows. The clinical data are expressed as means  $\pm\,S.\mathrm{D}$  . or in percent.  

# Results  

The clinical and routine laboratory parameters are reported in Table 1; the upper block relates to all of the patients, whereas the lower one presents the corresponding parameters for the subjects free from ischemic heart disease.  

In all of our subjects, the LTA 252G and LTA 804A SNPs occurred concomitantly, this finding confirming the observations of others (Messer et al., 1991). The different genotypes were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. As shown in Table 2 (upper block), both SNPs were more frequent in the overall   $(13.9\%.$  ; OR 2.1,  $p<0.025)$  ) and the large-vessel ischemic stroke groups   $(18.2\%;\mathrm{OR}\,2.89,p\!<\!\bar{0}.005)$  ) than in the controls  $(7.2\%)$  . The frequencies of these SNPs in the smallvessel   $(8.2\%)$   and mixed-type stroke   $(11.2\%)$   groups did not differ significantly as compared with the controls. After exclusion of the patients with ischemic heart disease, including those with myocardial infarction (Table 2, lower block), the same associations were found as in the unsorted cohorts of patient (upper block). The logistic regression calculations confirmed

# Discussion  

In a recent case–control association study, functional SNPs in the  LTA gene  were identified as factors causing a susceptibility to myocardial infarction (Ozaki et al., 2002). These SNPs included the intron 252G haplotype, which has already been shown to coexist with an exon 804A SNP (Messer et al., 1991). This haplotype has been demonstrated to increase the transcription of LTA1.5-fold in a cellular expression system, and evidence of an increased binding capacity of this allelic variant for certain, as yet unidentified, transcription factors has also been presented (Ozaki et al., 2002).  

Lymph o toxinα  (LTA), which is also a proinflammatory cytokine, with homology to TNF ${\cdot\alpha}$   (Schreyer et al., 2002), can induce adhesion molecules and cytokines from vascular endo the li al cells, vascular smooth-muscle cells, and certain types of leukocytes; the adhesion molecules are consistently expressed in a the ros l erotic plaques, and their circulating levels are elevated in atherosclerosis (Ware et al., 1995; O’Brien et al., 1996; Squadrito et al., 1996; Belch et al., 1997; Hwang et al., 1997; Morisaki et al., 1997; Ross, 1999). Arecent report demonstrated that a deficiency of LTA, but not of TNF $\cdot\upalpha,$   in knockout mice was associated with a reduction in size of diet-induced atherosclerotic plaques, thereby revealing a direct role of LTA in promoting such lesion growth (Schreyer et al., 2002). These findings suggested that LTA is the member of the TNF ligand family that predominantly elicits pro a the rogen ic responses. The 252G allelic variant of the  LTA gene  has been implicated as a naturally occurring variant enhancing the magnitude of these processes (Ozaki et al., 2002). Albeit that these

observations could be fitted straightforwardly to the role of the LTAand its modifying variants in the development of myocardial infarction, we hypothesized that this post ul ation could not be restricted to myocardial infarction.  

In our case–control association study, the prevalence of the homozygous LTA 252G variant was increased 1.9-fold in a mixed population of ischemic stroke subjects as compared with selected controls free from a silent cerebral infarction (Table 1). Sub classification of the patients revealed that this increase was attributable to the increased prevalence of the LTA 252G haplotype in patients classified as having large-vessel-associated cerebral infarcts, evidenced by the 2.5-fold increase in this vascular type. This observation, together with  

the logistic regression calculations (Table 2), suggested that this LTA variant is an independent risk factor for cerebral large-vessel pathology-associated ischemic stroke.  

Because a significant number of patients with ischemic heart disease, including those with myocardial infarction, were present in all of our groups, to exclude a possible misinterpretation of the data, these subjects were omitted and the associations were recalculated. The data resulting from this approach (Tables 1 and 2) confirmed the role of the LTA 252G variant in large-vessel-associated stroke.  

It should be noted that in large-vessel-associated cerebral infarction, a prominent role of atherogenesis already has been well established (Pessin et al., 1979; Schulz and Rothwell, 2003). With regard to the postulated role of the LTAin at hero genesis, our results are consistent with the findings of Ozaki et al. (2002) in patients with myocardial infarction. In contrast, a recent paper by Um et al. (2003) presented opposing data on a mixed population of ischemic stroke patients. The explanation for the difference is not known, though there are some differences in study design. In the study by Um et al. (2003), the frequency of the LTA252G genotype was  $19\%$   in the mixed stroke population, which is similar to that in our large-vessel ischemic stroke group  $(18.2\%)$  ). The prevalence of this  LTA allele  was  $18.6\%$  in the controls, whereas in our controls it was only  $7.2\%$  . The average age of the controls in the study by Um et al. (2003) was 62.2 yr. At this age, a considerable proportion   $(10–40\%)$   of silent brain infarction normally can be expected (Kobayashi et al., 1991; Shinkawa et al., 1995; Price et al., 1997; Fisher et al., 1998); in our controls, such silent infarction was excluded via the selection by MRI or CT. Furthermore, there was no sub classification of ischemic stroke in the Korean study (Um et al., 2003); and the possibility of ethnic differences cannot be ruled out.  

In summary, both myocardial infarction and a the roth rom bot ic stroke are multi factorial diseases involving a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors, many of which are common to both disorders; the data presented in the current study demonstrate that the LTA252G allelic variants are such factors.
