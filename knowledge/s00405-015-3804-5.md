Abstract The ph os ph odi est erase 4D ( PDE4D ) gene has been reported as a risk gene for ischemic stroke. The vascular factors are between the hypothesized etiologies of sudden sensor i neural hearing loss (SSNHL), and this genetic effect might be attributed for its role in SSNHL. We hypothesized that genetic variants of the  PDE4D  gene are associated with susceptibility to SSNHL. We conducted a case–control study with 362 SSNHL cases and 209 controls. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected. The genotypes were determined using TaqMan technology. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested for each SNP, and genetic effects were evaluated according to three inheritance modes. We carried out sex-speciﬁc analysis to analyze the overall data. All three SNPs were in HWE. When subjects were stratiﬁed by sex, the genetic effect was only evident in females but not in males. The TT genotype of rs702553 exhibited an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 3.83 (  $95~\%$  conﬁdence inter-  $\mathrm{val}=1.46{-}11.18)$  )   $(p=0.006)$   in female SSNHL. The TT genotype of SNP rs702553 was associated with female SSNHL under the recessive model (  $\left(p=0.004\right.$  , OR 3.70). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, TT genotype of rs702553 was sign i cant ly associated with female SSNHL  $(p=0.0043\$  , OR 3.70). These results suggest that  PDE4D gene polymorphisms inﬂuence the susceptibility for the development of SSNHL in the southern Taiwanese female population.

# Introduction  

Sudden sensor i neural hearing loss (SSNHL) is deﬁned as a loss of at least   $30~\mathrm{dB}$   in 3 contiguous frequencies over a period of 3 days or less [ 1 ]. The incidence rates per 100,000 people in the Taiwan population are 8.85 for men and 7.79 for women [ 1 ]. The etiology and pathogen es is of SSNHL are not known, but the primary proposed causes include viral infection, vascular disease, and autoimmunity [ 1 ]. SSNHL is a complex multi factor disease that may include genetic factors, as it has been associated with heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70), factor V Leiden G1691A, pro thro mb in G20210A, and methylene-tetra hydro folate reductase (MTHFR) C677T [ 2 – 4 ]. SSNHL, in patients with factor V Leiden, has been associated with life-threatening medical conditions such as leg and pulmonary venous thr ombo embolism and cerebral sinus venous thrombosis as reported by Lovato et al. [ 5 ].  

Acquired and inherited cardiovascular risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of developing SSNHL [ 6 ]. A personal or familial history of cardiovascular events, including coronary in suf cie n cy, myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack, have also been found to be more prevalent in patients with SSNHL than the control group [ 7 ,  8 ].  

Ph os ph odi est erase 4D ( PDE4D ) (OMIM 600129) is a large gene, which spans  ${\tt>}1.5$   Mb region on chromosomal region 5q12 and has 22 exons [ 9 ]. Previous studies revealed that the  $P D E4D$   [ 9 ], factor V Leiden [ 10 ], and MTHFR gene [ 11 ] were associated with stroke [ 12 ]. Previous studies also revealed a signiﬁcant association of rs702553 (SNP56) of  PDE4D  with ischemic stroke [ 13 – 15 ]. A meta-analysis by Yoon et al. also found the most signiﬁcant association of rs705223 (SNP56) with ischemic stroke [ 16 ].  

PDE4D  gene encodes ph os ph odi est erase 4D, which is a member of a large superfamily of cyclic nucleotide phosph odi est erases. PDE4D regulates the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal transduction in various cell types including in amma tory, endo the li al, and smooth muscle cells [ 17 ]. Decreased cAMP level enhances vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, the events representing atherosclerosis [ 9 ]. This dreadful complication of atherosclerosis can result in stroke and/or myocardial infarction [ 18 ]. PDE4D protein has been hypothesized to be involved in stroke risk through this at hero sclerotic pathway [ 9 ,  19 ]. Manipulation of the PDE4D pathway has been exploited therapeutically in an experimental model of stroke [ 20 ].  

Therefore,  PDE4D  gene polymorphisms may play a role in the pathogen es is of SSNHL. No data have been published on the relationship between  PDE4D  genetic polymorphisms and the risk of SSNHL. This study investigated whether  $P D E4D$   gene polymorphisms were risk factors for SSNHL in southern Taiwanese subjects. We conducted a case– control study to investigate the role of  PDE4D  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the development of SSNHL in a southern Taiwanese population.  

# Materials and methods  

# Subjects  

We recruited 362 patients with the SSNHL and 209 controls at the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital between October 2010 and July 2013. The diagnostic criteria of SSNHL included sensor i neural hearing loss of at least   $30~\mathrm{dB}$   in three contiguous frequencies using a pure tone audiogram with an onset within 3 days [ 1 ]. Healthy volunteers without a history of hearing loss or any ear disorders were enrolled as controls. Information on demographic characteristics was collected.  

Audio metric tests, including pure tone audiometry, auditory brainstem-evoked responses, and computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude acoustic neuroma) were performed in SSNHL patients.  

The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital approved this study, and informed consent was signed by each subject.  

# SNP selection and Genotyping  

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using a standard method. Three SNPs were selected according to previous studies associated with stroke in southern Taiwan

 [ 13 ,  21 ]. The three SNPs included the SNP rs702553

 (SNP56), rs966221 (SNP83) and rs2910829 (SNP87) of the PDE4D  gene.  

Genotyping was performed using TaqMan technology (7500 Real Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and reactions were performed in 96-well microplates in ABI 9700 thermal cyclers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Fluorescence was measured using an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System and analyzed with System SDS software version 1.2.3. Each subject was typed for all SNPs.  

# Statistical analysis  

Continuous variables were analyzed using independent  $t$   tests, and the results were presented as means  $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$  . The allele frequency was obtained using direct gene counting. The Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was examined in  

$X^{2}$    controls using the   test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for the effects of age, sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia while assessing the genetic effects. We examined the effect of the minor allele of each SNP in three genetic models: dominant, additive, and recessive. We analyzed the sex-speciﬁc genetic effect by stratifying the subjects into male and female. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with SSNHL. The JMP software version 9.0 Stat View version 5.0 (SAS institute Inc.) for Windows was used for statistical analysis. Two-tailed    $p$   values    ${<}0.05$   were considered signiﬁcant.  

# Ethical concerns  

The Institutional Review Board of the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital approved this study (approval No. KMUH-IRB-990243), and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.  

# Results  

# Study participants  

The demographic features of the study population are shown in Table  1 . The mean age of the 362 cases (187 male and 175 female) was   $51.1\pm14.6$   years, and the mean age of the 209 control volunteers (120 male and 89 female) was  $34.8\pm7.3$   years. The age of SSNHL patients was older than that of the control group   $(p<0.001)$  . The sex distribution was 1.07:1 (male–female) in SSNHL patients. The sex characteristics were not sign i cant ly different between the two groups. The prevalence s of diabetes mellitus and hypertension were higher in the SSNHL patients than in the control group   $(p<0.001)$  , although hyper lipid emi a was not signiﬁcant between the two groups. The prevalence of personal history of cardiovascular events was similar in SSNHL patients   $(10.8~\%)$  

and controls   $(6.7\ \%$  ,  $p\,=0.106)$  . The familial history of cardiovascular events was sign i cant ly higher in SSNHL patients   $(33.4\ \%)$   than controls (  $18.2\ \%$  ,  $p<0.0001$  , OR 2.26,   $95~\%$   CI 1.49–3.42).  

# Single SNP results  

The distribution of  $P D E4D$   genotypes was in HWE among control subjects using  $p=0.05$   as the cutoff point. The distributions of genotypes and allele frequencies of the PDE4D  SNPs are listed in Table  2 . The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were computed for the association analyses between  PDE4D  genotypes and SSNHL.  

The genotypic and allelic distributions were not significantly different between the SSNHL patients and control group for SNPs rs702553, rs966221, and rs2910829 (Table  2 ).  

# Stratiﬁed by sex  

The SNP rs702553 rare allele T was sign i cant ly higher in the SSNHL patients compared to the control group in females (41 vs.  $29\ \%$  )   $(p=0.011)$  ) (Table  3 ). For rs702553 in females, after adjusting for age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyper lipid emi a, the results indicated that genotype TT [adjusted odds ratio  $(\mathrm{OR})=3.83$  ,    $p~=0.006]$   and AT (adjusted OR 1.08,  $p\,=0.821$  ) carried a higher risk than the reference AA genotype (Table  3 ). Neither rs966221 nor rs2910829 was related to female SSNHL.  

Three genetic models (assuming the rare allele having a dominant, recessive, or additive effect) were used to evaluate the associations between  PDE4D  gene and SSNHL. A signiﬁcant result was observed under the recessive model, which yielded an adjusted OR of 3.70  $[95\ \%$   conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.48–10.37,  $p=0.004]$   for TT vs.   $\mathrm{\AA}+\mathrm{AT}$   of rs702553 after adjustment for age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in females (Table  4 ). Compared with the A allele carriers   $(\mathrm{AA}+\mathrm{AT}$   genotypes), the TT genotype conferred

an increased risk for SSNHL in females (OR 3.70,  $p=0.004)$   but not in males (OR 0.84,  $p=0.647)$   (Table  4 ).  

The multivariate logistic regression model yielded an adjusted OR of 3.70 (  $95~\%$   CI 1.48–10.37,  $p=0.0043)$   for the genotype TT vs.   $\mathrm{\AA}+\mathrm{AT}$   of rs702553 after adjustment for age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyper lipid emi a in females (Table  5 ).  

No signiﬁcant results for SNPs rs702553, rs966221 and rs2910829 were observed in any of the three genetic models in male SSNHL patients. The ﬁnal multivariate regression model suggested that age and TT genotype of rs702553 were the major risk factors for female SSNHL (Table  5 ).  

# Discussion  

We investigated the relationship between three SNPs in the PDE4D  gene and SSNHL in a southern Taiwanese population. Our results revealed a sex-differential effect of the PDE4D  gene on SSNHL. When subjects were stratiﬁed by sex, the genetic effect was only evident in females but not in males. The signiﬁcant result stemmed from the rs702553 (SNP56) polymorphism of the  PDE4D  gene, which indicates that the rare  $\mathrm{T}$   allele sign i cant ly increases the risk for females SSNHL in southern Taiwan. The multivariate logistic regression model yielded an adjusted OR of 3.70

 (  $95~\%$   CI 1.48–10.37,    $p=0.0043)$  ) for the genotype TT vs.

  $\mathrm{\AA}+\mathrm{AT}$   of rs702553 after adjustment for age smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyper lipid emi a in females. No signiﬁcant differences existed between the SSNHL and control groups at SNP rs966221 and SNP rs2910829.  

However, SNP rs702553 has not been associated with hearing impairment before. Previous study revealed an association between  PDE4D  polymorphism and ischemic stroke among nor moten sive patients [ 13 ] in the SNP rs702553, but not in rs966221 or rs2910829 of  PDE4D .  

Furthermore, signiﬁcant results were observed under recessive models in this study, which yielded an adjusted OR of 3.70   $(p=0.004)$   for TT vs.   $\mathrm{\AA\mathrm{~+~}A T}$   of rs702553 after adjustment for age, smoking, diabetes mellitus,

hypertension, and hyper lipid emi a. This result revealed the tendency for the A-carrier subjects   $(\mathrm{AA}+\mathrm{AT})$   to exhibit a lower incidence of SSNHL than subjects with the TT genotype in females. This result indicated that the A-carrier is a protective factor for SSNHL in females. The T allele of rs702553 was found to be a risk factor for female SSNHL in our study.  

The sex-differential effect of the PDE4D gene had been reported in previous study. The SNP rs702553 was signiﬁcant in young stroke males (OR 1.8,  $p=0.025)$  ) but not in females   $(p=0.27)$   [ 21 ]. Zee et al. also revealed the sexdependent effect of the PDE4D gene in ischemic stroke in the United States [ 15 ].  

Sex-speciﬁc effect has been demonstrated in other genes. For example, the endo the li al NO synthase gene ( NOS3 ) affects vascular stiffness in females but not in males [ 22 ]. The solute carrier family 2 member 9 ( SLC2A9 ) gene accounts for a larger proportion of uric acid variation in females than in males [ 23 ]. The SSNHL is a complex disease, and is affected by various etiologies and genetic risk factors. The gender discrepancy of association with SSNHL may be attributed to the complex etiology and the multi factorial

background of the pathogen es is of SSNHL. A possible biological explanation is that sex hormones may regulate the expression of these candidate genes.  

The major limitation of this study is that it was only performed in subjects in Eastern Asia. Further studies among different ethnic groups are needed to further generalize our results. In addition, further functional analyses of SNP rs702553 in the PDE4D gene in SSNHL are warranted.  

# Conclusions  

The results of this study support the inﬂuence of genetic polymorphisms of  PDE4D  gene for the risk of SSNHL in a southern Taiwanese population. The TT genotype of the SNP rs702553 may be a risk genotype for female SSNHL.
