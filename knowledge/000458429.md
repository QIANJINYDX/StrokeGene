# Abstract  

Background/Aims:   Genetic polymorphisms of methylene   tetra hydro folate reductase ( MTHFR )  were associated with ischemic stroke risk. This study analyzed  MTHFR  polymorphisms at the   $_3\cdot$  -untranslated region   for association with risk and outcome of ischemic stroke in a Chinese  Han population.  Methods:  500 patients and 600 healthy volunteers were enrolled for  MTHFR   rs868014 genotyping identified bio in format ic ally. The binding of miR-1203 to  MTHFR  rs868014 was determined by luciferase assay,  MTHFR  expression was assessed using qRTPCR, and plasma homo cyst eine levels were assayed by ELISA.  Results:   Cigarette smoking,  alcohol consumption, diabetes, hypertension (all  $\mathsf{P}<\!0.001\!,$  ), low levels of serum high-density  lipoprotein-C   $(\mathsf{P}\ =\ 0.01)$  ), and high levels of serum low-density lipoprotein-C   $(\mathsf{P}\ =\ 0.005)$  )  were associated with an increased risk of developing ischemic stroke. BMI and total serum  cholesterol concentration was not associated with ischemic stroke.  MTHFR  rs868014 TC and  CC genotypes were significantly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke compared  with the TT genotype (OR: 1.52;   $95\%$   CI: 1.01-3.39 for TC genotype, while OR: 1.99;   $95\%$   CI:  1.29-3.88 for CC genotype). Furthermore, the  MTHFR  rs868014 SNP was associated with a  poor short-term ischemic stroke outcome. qRT-PCR   confirmed that  MTHFR  rs868014 TC  or CC genotypes could facilitate miR-1203 binding leading to low  MTHFR  levels in cells. In  addition, patients carrying the  MTHFR  rs868014 TC or CC genotypes were associated with  accumulation of serum tHcy and a poor ischemic stroke outcome. Linkage d is equilibrium  analysis indicated that the newly identified SNP rs868014 was strongly linked with the MTHFR  A1298C polymorphism.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that the  MTHFR  rs868014 SNP  is associated with increased risk in developing ischemic stroke, miR-1203 binding, low  MTHFR   levels in cells, and poor shot term outcome of patients.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a major cause of mortality in the elderly population worldwide. Clinically,  stroke can be divided into ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke is usually  caused by blockage of a blood vessel, whereas hemorrhagic stroke is caused by rupture  of a vessel leading to bleeding in the brain [1, 2]. According to recent statistics, there  were approximately 6.9 million patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke and 3.4 million  patients with a hemorrhagic stroke in 2013 [3]. In China, the annual stroke mortality rate is  approximately 157 per 100,000, which is the leading cause of death and adult disability [4- 6]. The major stroke risk factors include high blood pressure, tobacco smoking, obesity, high  blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation [7], indicating that genetic factors  also contribute to stroke.  

Methylene tetra hydro folate reductase ( MTHFR ) is the key enzyme involved in plasma  homo cyst eine (tHcy) metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of 5, 10-methyl tetra hydro folate  to 5-methyl tetra hydro folate, a methyl donor during tHcy re methyl ation [8]. tHcy is a crucial  intermediate in methionine metabolism and causes excessive production of reactive oxygen  species (ROS) [9, 10]. This plays an important role in the regulation of cell signaling and  homeostasis. During stress, ROS levels can be increased dramatically, resulting in cell  structure damage. For example, up regulated tHcy can induce cell apoptosis by increased ROS  levels through activation of the p38 MAPK pathway [11]. In the context of stroke, the elevated  levels of plasma tHcy were shown to associate with increased risk of ischemic stroke [12,  13].  MTHFR  is localized at chromosome   $1\ \mathrm{p}36.3$   in the human genome, and to date there  are over 40 point mutations or SNPs in the  MTHFR  gene identified [14]. Of these, C677T  (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) are the most significant mutations that associate  with ischemic stroke [15, 16]. The  MTHFR  rs1801133 polymorphism involves substitution  of C to T at position 677 (C677T), causing the conversion of alanine to valine. This missense  mutation will result in approximately  $70\%$   and  $35\%$   reductions of normal  MTHFR  enzymatic  activity in TT and CT genotype carriers, respectively [17]. The A1298C variant results in  substitution of glutamate (Glu) to alanine (Ala) at codon 429 in the S-a de no syl methionine  regulatory domain of the  MTHFR  protein [18, 19]. The   MTHFR  C677T genetic variant can  lead to elevated levels of plasma tHcy and, thus, increased  ischemic stroke risk [20, 21],  data of which have been further confirmed in other studies [12, 13, 22]. tHcy is thought to  increase thrombotic risk through induction of endo the li al injury in the venous and arterial  vas cula ture [23]. Thus, further study of genetic variants of  MTHFR  could help to better  understand ischemic stroke risk and underlying molecular mechanisms.  

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small, non-coding RNA molecules. Through binding to the   $3^{\prime}$  untranslated region (  $\because3^{\prime}$  -UTR) of messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNA can cause degradation  of mRNA, thus regulating the expression of mRNA at post-transcription level. Genetic  variations in the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of certain genes are able to change the expression of the genes and  alter the risk of a variety of human cancers [24-27]. Thus, in this study, we assessed genetic  variants in the  MTHFR  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR in ischemic stroke patients vs. healthy control individuals, and  then associated these genetic variants with miRNA levels using a case-control study design  in a Chinese Han population. This study provides novel insightful information regarding  MTHFR  genetic variants and miR-1023 expression in changes in ischemic stroke risk in this  population.  

# Materials and Methods  

Study subjects  

In this study, we enrolled 500 patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke from Jiangyin People’s Hospital  (Jiangyin, China) between June 2009 and August 2015. Diagnosis of patients with ischemic stroke was  established clinically and confirmed by using X-ray computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance  imaging scans of the brain. We also recruited 600 healthy volunteers from this hospital during the same  period of time and they were matched to the cases by age and gender. All control individuals visited our  hospital for annual health check-ups and were free of ischemic stroke. This study was approved by the  Ethics Committee of Jiangyin People’s Hospital and each participant signed a written informed consent. All  case and control individuals filled out a study questionnaire, which included demographic al information,  medical history (hypertension or diabetes mellitus), alcohol consumption, tobacco smoke (daily number  and years), obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure   $>\,140/90$     $\mathrm{mmHg}$   (average of three independent measures) or the use of anti hypertensive drugs. Diabetes mellitus  was defined as a fasting glucose level  $\geq7.0\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$   and/or  $\cdot\geq11.1\;\mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{L}\;2\;\mathrm{L}$  h after oral glucose challenge,  or receiving anti-diabetic medication. Subjects who had smoked more than 10 cigarettes daily for 5 years  were considered as smokers. Subjects who drank more than  $50~\mathrm{{ml}}$   of alcoholic beverages daily for 5 years  were considered as alcohol drinkers. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was used  to quantify stroke severity in patients at the time of presentation and discharge.  

Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping  

Blood samples were collected after a   $12\textrm{h}$   overnight fasting period and then separated into serum,  red blood cells, and buffy coat. Genomic DNA from peripheral whole blood of every validation subject was  extracted by using QIAamp DNA blood mini kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s  instructions. After quant if i cation, these DNA samples were subjected to DNA genotyping using the TaqMan  SNP Genotyping Assay. Briefly, genomic DNA samples of   $10~\mathrm{{ng}}$   each were amplified using PCR in a total  volume of  $5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   containing TaqMan Universal Master Mix,   $80\mathrm{x}$   SNP Genotyping AssayMix, DNase-free water  and 10-ng DNA. The PCR conditions were  $50\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $2\,\mathrm{{min}}$   and then   $95~^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$   for  $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$  , followed by 40 cycles of   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $15\,s$   and   $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\,\mathrm{{min}}$   in a 384-well ABI  $7900\mathrm{HT}$   Real Time PCR System as described previously  [28].  

Bio in format ic analysis of miRNAs binding to MTHFR SNP and linkage d is equilibrium analysis among  MTHFR polymorphisms  

Bioinformatics software (http://www.bioguo.org/miRNASNP/) was used to detect the candidate SNPs  which could affect  MTHFR  gene regulation via miRNAs. The Hapmap database and Haploview software were  used to analyze the linkage d is equilibrium among  MTHFR  polymorphisms.  

Cell line, culture, and mIR-1203 transfection  

Embryonic Kidney 293T cells were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank  (Shanghai, China) and cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Gait her s burg, MD, USA) supplemented with   $10\,\%$   fetal  bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a humidified incubator with   $5~\%$     $\mathsf{C}0_{2}$  at   $37~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . miR-1203  mimics and control were obtained from Genepharma (Shanghai, China) and trans fec ted into 293T cells  using Lip of ect amine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.  

Construction of luciferase-based reporter plasmids and luciferase reporter assay  

MTHFR  3'-UTR fragments containing either C or T alleles were amplified using PCR from genomic  DNA and cloned into pGL3-promoter less luciferase-based plasmids (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) multiple  cloning sites, BamHI and XhoI.  MTHFR    $3^{\prime}$  -UTR fragments potentially binding to miR-1203, predicted by  bio in format ical analysis or a mutated sequence with the predicted target sites, were cloned using PCR from  genomic DNA and inserted into the pGL3 promoter vector (Genscript, Nanjing, China). The cloned plasmids  were amplified and verified by DNA sequencing.  

For the dual-luciferase reporter assay, 293T cells were plated onto 24-well plates and trans fec ted with  100 ng of pGL3-  MTHFR  wild, pGL3-  MTHFR  mutant, and miR-1203 mimics, respectively, using Lip of ect amine  2000 (Invitrogen). A Renilla luciferase vector pRL-SV40 (5 ng) was also co-trans fec ted as a normalization  and transfection efficiency control. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and luciferase activity was  assessed  $48\,\mathrm{h}$   after transfection using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase  activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity according to a previous study [29].  

Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)  

qRT-PCR was performed to determine levels of  MTHFR  mRNA. In brief, total RNA was isolated from  293T cells using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using  the TaqMan  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   Reverse Transcription Kit, according to the manufacturers’ instructions (ABI, CA, USA). The  cDNA samples were then subjected to   $\mathrm{qPCR}$   amplification under conditions of   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $10\;\mathrm{{min}}$   followed by  40 cycles of   $95\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\;s,$  ,  $55\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $40\ s,$   and  $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\;s_{i}$  , and finally  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$   using the Realmaster  Mix (SYBR Green I) (TAKARA, Dalian, China).  

ELISA of plasma homo cyst eine levels  

Plasma levels of tHcy in patients was assessed using a tHcy ELISA kit (Green Stone, Bern, Switzerland),  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The level of plasma tHcy was normalized to the kit standard and  the data were summarized as mean  $\pm$   sd and then associated with outcome in ischemic stroke patients.  

# Statistical analysis  

The association between different genetic variants and ischemic stroke risk was evaluated by  calculation of the odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) using univariate and multivariate  logistic regression analysis. The difference in association of  MTHFR  mRNA levels with three  MTHFR   genotypes and of the relative luciferase activity between the wild and mutant genotype were evaluated  by using an independent-sample  t  test. All statistical analyses were two-sided and  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$   was considered  statistically significant using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) or SAS software (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute,  Cary, NC, USA).  

# Results  

Characteristics of participants  

Characteristics of patients with ischemic stroke and healthy controls are shown in Table 

 1. Specifically, the controls were matched with cases for age and gender. Cigarette smoking 

  $(\mathrm{P}<\!0.001)$  , alcohol consumption   $(\mathrm{P}<\!0.001)$  , diabetes and hypertension   $(\mathrm{P}<\!0.001)$  , a low  level of serum high-density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C;   $\mathrm{P}=0.01\$  ), and high level of serum lowdensity lipoprotein-C (LDL-C;   $\mathsf{P}=0.005\$  ) were significantly associated with ischemic stroke.  However, BMI and total serum cholesterol concentration were not associated with ischemic  stroke (Table1).  

Identification of MTHFR polymorphisms in   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR  

Previous studies demonstrated an association of  MTHFR  genetic variants in gene  coding regions with ischemic stroke risk [15, 18, 19]. In this study, we mainly focused on  the relationship of the SNPs in the  MTHFR    $3^{\prime}$  -UTR to ischemic stroke risk and outcome. We  first searched the GenBank of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) database (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp) to identify potential  MTHFR  genetic variants in the  $3^{\prime}$  -UTR using  the following parameters: Organism (Homo sapiens); Function Class (  $"3"$  -UTR); Global MAF 

 (0.05-0.1); Validation Status (by-1000 Genomes). We identified five  MTHFR  polymorphisms 

 (Table 2).  

We then assessed genotype frequencies of these five  MTHFR  SNPs in 500 ischemic  stroke patients and 600 healthy controls. We found that the  MTHFR  SNP rs868014 had a  statistically different distribution between ischemic stroke patients and healthy controls.  The minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs868014 was 0.365 in controls. There were no  differences in other  MTHFR  SNPs between cases and controls (data not shown). The MAF  of rs2184226, rs3737967, rs2077360 and rs4845884 were 0.02, 0.16, 0.03 and 0.08 in  controls respectively. The Chi-square test confirmed that the genotype of rs868014 was in  Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium distribution pattern in the healthy control group   $\mathrm{P}=0.22\$  ).  The logistic regression analysis revealed that  MTHFR  rs868014 TC and CC genotypes  significantly associated with increased risk of developing of ischemic stroke compared with  the TT genotype (OR: 1.52; 95 %CI: 1.01-3.39 for TC genotype, while OR: 1.99;  $95~\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.29- 3.88 for CC genotype; Table 3). A higher number of C-alleles were also associated with an  increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR: 1.71;   $95\;\%$  CI: 1.33-3.56).

Association of the MTHFR rs868014 SNP with a poor short-term ischemic stroke outcome  Next, we assessed the association of the  MTHFR  rs868014 SNP with short-term ischemic  stroke outcome. The latter was assessed by using two independent scales: 1) the Functional  Independence Measure (FIM); and 2) the National Institutes of Health Scale Score (NIHSS).  The FIM instrument is an 18-item scale, which measures independence involved in feeding,  grooming, dressing, toileting, mobility, and cognition. Subjects are scored from 7 (totally  independent) to 1 (totally dependent) on each item, with a score of 126 indicating total  functional independence. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific  ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in  that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. We found  that patients carrying either the  MTHFR  rs868014 TC or CC genotype had a decreased FIM  score in both motor and cognitive assessments. Moreover, initial stroke severity in the acute  phase, as measured by NIHSS, was significantly different among the different genotypes  (TC/TT,  $\mathrm{P}=0.03$   and CC/TT,  $\mathrm{P}=0.02\$  ). Recovery from ischemic stroke was measured as the  change in NIHSS score between the acute phase and three months post-stroke. A negative  value indicated clinical improvement in ischemic stroke outcome. Our data showed that the  minor alleles of rs868014 had a trend towards a poor outcome of ischemic stroke (TC/TT, P   $=0.01$   and CC/TT,  $\mathrm{P}=0.004$  ; Table 4).  

# MTHFR rs868014 SNP alteration of miR-1203 binding  

Thus far, we revealed that the  MTHFR  rs868014 SNP was associated with risk and poor  ischemic stroke outcome. We then performed bio in format ical analysis to determine whether  this  MTHFR  rs868014 SNP could have miRNA binding sites. We found that miR-1203 could  bind to this particular SNP of the minor allele (Fig. 1A). We therefore performed a luciferase  assay to confirm such binding and found that luciferase activity of C-allele-specific pGL3

construct was significantly suppressed by miR-1203. Luciferase activity of the T-allelespecific pGL3 construct was not altered by miR-1203 transfection in 293T cells (Fig. 1B).  

We next assessed levels of  MTHFR  mRNA in patients carrying the  MTHFR  rs868014  TT, TC, and CC genotypes. Our data showed that patients carrying the  MTHFR  rs868014  TC or CC genotypes had a decreased level of  MTHFR  compared with patients with the TT  genotype (Fig. 1C and Table 4). We then assayed levels of serum tHcy in patients and found  that patients carrying the  MTHFR  rs868014 TC or CC genotype were associated with the  accumulation of serum tHcy and with a poor ischemic stroke outcome (Table 4).  

Linkage equilibrium analysis of MTHFR rs868014 vs. other MTHFR SNPs  

The linkage d is equilibrium was defined as the co inheritance of alleles in a haplotype  manifesting at the population level. We analyzed the linkage d is equilibrium between  rs868014 and other  MTHFR  SNPs using the Hapmap database and Haploview software. We  found that there was no link between rs868014 and C677T (rs1801133,   $\mathbf{r}^{2}=0.27]$  ), but a  positive link between rs868014 with A1298C (rs1801131) and some other SNPs (rs6541003,  rs1994798, rs1476413, rs3818762, rs4346048,  $\mathrm{r}^{2}\ge0.8]$  ) (Fig. 2).  

# Discussion  

In the current study, we analyzed the  MTHFR  rs868014 polymorphism in blood  samples obtained from ischemic stroke patients vs. healthy controls and then associated  this polymorphism with ischemic stroke risk and outcome in a Chinese Han population. We

found that cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes and hypertension, low levels of  serum high-density lipoprotein-C, and high levels of serum low-density lipoprotein-C were  all associated with an increased risk of developing ischemic stroke. BMI and total serum  cholesterol concentration were not associated with ischemic stroke. Moreover, we also found  that  MTHFR  rs868014 TC and CC genotypes were significantly associated with increased risk  of ischemic stroke compared with the TT genotype.  MTHFR  rs868014 TC and CC genotypes  were also associated with a poor short-term ischemic stroke outcome. In addition, our  data was first to show that  MTHFR  rs868014 TC or CC genotypes could facilitate miR-1203  binding, leading to low  MTHFR  levels in cells. To our knowledge, the binding of miR-1203  to  MTHFR  rs1801133 or rs1801131 has not been investigated yet.  MTHFR  rs868014 TC or  CC genotypes were also associated with increased serum tHcy and a poor ischemic stroke  outcome. The data from our current study demonstrated the importance of the  MTHFR   rs868014 SNP in  MTHFR  expression, miR-1203 binding, development of ischemic stroke,  and poor shot term outcomes of patients. Our current data are novel, although a previous  study showed association of  MTHFR  rs868014 with choline/1-carbon metabolism and  inversely with steatosis [30].  

MTHFR  is an important enzyme in the generation of ROS and subsequent cell damage  [23-25]. Indeed, in ischemic conditions, ROS generation is enhanced and can lead to damage  to various types of cells, including brain endo the li al cells, leading to formation of thrombosis  and loss of brain function [31]. Our current study provides direct evidence showing that  this novel  MTHFR  rs868014 polymorphism increases the risk of developing ischemic stroke  compared with healthy controls. Mechanistic ally, the  MTHFR  rs868014 polymorphism alters  the binding of miR-1203 to negatively regulate  MTHFR  expression, providing an epigenetic  mechanism of gene regulation and expression.  

There is accumulating evidence demonstrating that SNPs localized at miRNA binding  sites (miRSNPs) could affect the binding of miRNAs to the target genes and in turn result  in reduction or increase in translation of the target mRNA and altered susceptibility to  cancer [28, 32]. For example, previous studies showed that the rs2910164 polymorphism  harboring the sequence for miR-146a could influence susceptibility to gastric cancer in a  Chinese population, while rs4143815 and rs4819388 SNPs in the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of B7-H1 and B7- H2 genes, respectively, associated with development of gastric cancer [33-35]. As for miR1203, a previous study showed that altered miR-1203 expression was a biomarker predicting  prostate cancer [36]. Our current study is the first to demonstrate the association between  miR-1203 and  MTHFR . Further study is needed to reveal the role of miR-1203 in ischemic  stroke development and outcome.  

Furthermore, we utilized the Hapmap database and Haploview software to analyze the  linkage d is equilibrium among  MTHFR  polymorphisms and found that there was a positive  link of rs868014 with A1298C (rs1801131) and some other SNPs (rs6541003, rs1994798,  rs1476413, rs3818762, rs4346048), although there was no link between rs868014 and  C677T (rs1801133). Our current data indicated that the function of rs868014 could be  linked to these SNPs. Future studies are needed to confirm such a link and investigate the  underlying mechanisms.  

Our current study does have some limitations. For example, a total of five  MTHFR   polymorphisms were assessed in this study, we only found an association of the  MTHFR   rs868014 polymorphism with ischemic stroke risk and outcome. Statistically, type 1  error may occur in our study; thus, independent samples or samples from another ethnic  population could be used to confirm our study. The MAF of rs868014 observed in our study  is much higher than reported by previous study [29]. It is probably due to the fact that our  study population is Southern Chinese Han population. Future study with larger samples may  be needed to confirm our study. Moreover, the linkage d is equilibrium analysis of rs868014  and other  MTHFR  SNPs showed that there was linkage d is equilibrium between rs868014  and other SNPs including rs1801131, indicating that the effects of rs868014 polymorphism  may be confounded with these  MTHFR  SNPs, however, we did not further assess their effects  on regulation of ischemic stroke risk and outcome. Further studies may be needed to clarify  the links between these  MTHFR  SNPs.  

In summary, our current study demonstrated: 1) cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption,  diabetes, hypertension, low levels of serum high-density lipoprotein-C, and high levels of  serum low-density lipoprotein-C were all associated with ischemic stroke risk; 2)  MTHFR   rs868014 TC and CC genotypes were associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke  compared with the TT genotype; 3) miR-1203 is able to bind to  MTHFR  rs868014 TC or CC  genotypes and down regulate  MTHFR  expression; 4) patients carrying  MTHFR  rs868014 TC  or CC genotypes had an increased level of serum tHcy and a poor ischemic stroke outcome.
