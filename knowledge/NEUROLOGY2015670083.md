# ABSTRACT  

Objective:  To investigate the genetic contributors to cerebro vascular disease and variation in biomarkers of ischemic stroke.  

Methods:  The Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention Trial (VISP) was a randomized, controlled clinical trial of B vitamin supplement ation to prevent recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. VISP collected baseline measures of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, creatinine, pro thro mb in fragments   $\mathsf{F}_{\bot+\geq\prime}$   thrombin-anti thro mb in complex, and thr ombo mod ul in prior to treatment initiation. Genome-wide association scans were conducted for these traits and follow-up replication analyses were performed.  

Results:  We detected an association between  CRP  single nucleotide polymorphisms   $({\mathsf{S N P S}})$   and circulating CRP levels (most associated SNP, rs2592902,  $\mathsf{p}=1.14\times\mathsf{10^{-9}}$   in 2,100 VISP participants. We discovered a novel association for CRP level in the  AKR1D1  locus (rs2589998,    $\mathsf{p}\,=\,7.3\,\times\,10^{-8},$  , approaching genome-wide significance) that also is an expression quantitative trait locus for  CRP  gene expression. We replicated previously identified associations of fibrinogen with SNPs in the  FGB  and LEPR  loci. CRP-associated SNPs and CRP levels were significantly associated with risk of ischemic stroke and recurrent stroke in VISP as well as specific stroke subtypes in METASTROKE. Fibrinogen levels but not fibrinogen-associated SNPs were also found to be associated with recurrent stroke in VISP.  

Conclusions:  Our data identify a genetic contribution to inflammatory and hemostatic biomarkers in a stroke population. Additionally, our results suggest shared genetic contributions to circulating CRP levels measured poststroke and risk for incident and recurrent ischemic stroke. These data broaden our understanding of genetic contributors to biomarker variation and ischemic stroke risk, which should be useful in clinical risk evaluation.  Neurology ®   2016;86:351 – 359

Prior data support the heritability of biomarker concentrations involved with inflammatory processes   and hemostasis.   Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic contributors to circulating levels of these traits in population studies. Investigating biomarkers in populations potentially enriched for genetic determinants can complement studies in the general population, facilitate the identification of genetic risk factors, and address whether the genetic factors influencing the biomarker also influence risk of the disease.  

Because of the known associations between biomarker status and disease risk, GWAS in human biomarker variability can contribute understanding of biomarker path o physiology 5 and development of treatment strategies.   We hypothesize an association between genetic variability and circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers and risk for stroke. In a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, we sought to test this hypothesis in the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) trial, an ischemic stroke population, for the genetic contributors of 6 biomarkers associated with stroke risk: C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, creatinine, pro thro mb in fragments

  $\mathrm{F}_{1+2}$     $\left(\mathrm{F}_{1+2}\right)$  , thrombin-anti thro mb in complex

 (TAT), and thr ombo mod ul in (TM). We next sought to replicate previous associations from biomarker GWAS in participants from the VISP trial. Leveraging these data, we then went on to investigate the relationship between the genetic determinants of these biomarkers with incident and recurrent ischemic stroke in both VISP and METASTROKE.  

The VISP population used for the primary analyses had available genotypic and phenotypic information for both biomarkers and recurrent stroke, with the latter a relatively infrequent phenotype in the stroke literature. The VISP population represents a unique resource since all participants had an ischemic stroke prior to study entry, and entry criteria — including the requirement that participants have total homo cyst eine levels in the top quartile — are anticipated to have selected a more homogenous sample.  

METHODS  A workflow of all analyses can be seen in figure e-1 on the  Neurology ®   Web site at Neurology.org.  

VISP participants.  A detailed description of the VISP study design and participants can be found in the e-Methods.  

GWAS.  In the VISP population, GWAS analyses were conducted using PLINK v1.0.7.   We used multivariable linear regression modeling to test correlation of quantitative traits and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We derived the first 10 principal components of ancestry from genotype data 9   using the KING software 9   and adjusted for population heterogeneity. We included age and sex as covariates in the regression model. No relatives were detected in the VISP population and no adjustments were made to the analysis for relatedness. We analyzed the following biomarkers: creatinine,  $\mathrm{F}_{1+2}$  , CRP, TAT, TM, and fibrinogen. We used the same regression model to perform association tests between phenotype and expected allele counts. The    $\upalpha$   was set at    $\mathscr{p}^{\ast}=$   $5\,\times\,10^{-8}$    for the genome-wide significance threshold for the primary analyses. Using standard settings, we generated Manhattan plots (figures 1, e-2) using the R package qqman (https://github.com/stephen turner/qqman). Regional association plots were created using the LocusZoom Plot with Your Data function (https://statgen.sph.umich.edu/ locuszoom/genform.php?type  $=$  yourdata).  

We accessed publicly available data for these biomarkers (table 1) to establish evidence of replication for the GWAS results.  $\mathcal{P}$   Value thresholds were based on a Bonferroni-corrected value of  $\mathit{\Phi}\mathit{\!\!\!/}\mathit{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\$     $\left(0.05/24\right)$  ) for CRP and  $\textstyle p\,=\,0.025$   $_{(0.05/2)}$   for fibrinogen. We interrogated our significant SNPs in a GWAS analysis of CRP in a general population cohort from the Framingham Heart Study.   We assessed significantly associated SNPs from previously published GWAS of the same biomarkers and related phenotypes (i.e., biomarker levels or vascular disease) in the VISP sample using SNPs that were genotyped, imputed, or had appropriate surrogate SNP data by linkage disequilibrium (LD)  $r^{2}>0.9$  . We investigated the single most significant SNPs from these publications applying appropriate Bonferroni corrections.  

Stroke analyses.  Survival analyses of recurrent stroke.  We used Cox proportional hazards models to investigate the associations between standardized CRP levels and SNPs with time until the first recurrent stroke measured from the time of randomization. During the trial, 182 individuals had recurrent stroke. Censoring occurred due to loss to follow-up, death, and early termination. We coded SNPs using additive genetic models, both a basic model (adjusting only for the intervention group) and a full model (adjusting for the intervention group, age, race, sex, smoking, body mass index, diabetes status, hypertension, and low-density lipoprotein).  

Replication of associated variants in case-control analysis of ischemic stroke risk.  We determined all the most significantly associated SNPs (or an appropriate surrogate) in the GWAS results from METASTROKE,   a study of 12,389 individuals with ischemic stroke and 62,004 controls with imputation to the Hapmap2 reference panel.   We obtained the results of associa- tion with all ischemic stroke and the 3 major stroke subtypes

 (large vessel [at hero sclerotic], card i oem boli c, and small vessel

 [lacunar] from the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment

 [TOAST] classification).  

Case-control analysis of ischemic stroke risk.  We investi- gated whether SNPs associated with the biomarker traits also contributed to ischemic stroke risk. For ischemic stroke case-control analyses, we compared VISP study participants (ischemic stroke cases) to publicly available controls from the GeneEnvironment Association Studies (GENEVA) Melanoma Study (dbGAP phs000187), restricting the population to individuals of European descent only. This control population was selected because GENEVA controls were genotyped on the same array as VISP (HumanOmni1-Quad_v1-0_B), and this case-control strategy has been published previously.  

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.  All studies received approval from an ethical standards committee on human experimentation and had written informed consent obtained from all participants (or surrogates). The VISP clinical trial identifier is NC T 00004734. The FHS clinical trial identifier is NC T 00005121. METASTROKE is not a clinical trial but has received all necessary approvals from the applicable regional and institutional review boards.

RESULTS  A total of 2,100 VISP participant samples were genotyped using the Illumina (San Diego, CA) HumanOmni1-Quad-v1 array with additional imputation of SNPs using 1000 Genomes Project (1000 G) data, resulting in a total coverage of 7,500,450 SNPs. Table 2 summarizes demographic information.  

Primary biomarker results.  CRP.  SNP rs2592902 had the strongest association   $(\phi\,=\,1.14\,\,\times\,\,10^{-9})$  ) with baseline CRP level. This SNP is   $26.4~\mathrm{lb}$   upstream from the    $C R P$   structural gene (table 1). Twenty-four significantly associated variants from our GWAS span the   $5^{\prime}$   to the   $3^{\prime}$   regions of the    $C R P$   gene. None of these SNPs is predicted to be damaging coding variants according to the human genome reference assembly GRCh37/hg19. Thus, these SNPs may be regulatory in their effect on CRP variation. A full functional analysis using HaploReg v2 can be found in table e-1.  

Two SNPs located on chromosome 7q33, rs2589998   $(\phi~=~7.3~\times~10^{-8})$  ) and rs2465086  $(\rlap/p=8.5\times10^{-8})$  ), approached genome-wide significance with CRP level (table 1). These SNPs are located near the Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1, Member D1 gene ( AKR1D1 ), and represent novel associations with CRP level. Both SNPs are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for    $C R P$   gene expression in liver (figure e-3).   We assessed association between these SNPs and CRP levels in the longitudinal, population-based Framingham Heart Study (FHS).   There was no statistically significant evidence supporting the association between rs2589998 and rs2465086 with CRP in FHS (data not shown), indicating a possible stroke population – specific effect.  

Fibrinogen.  SNP rs2801231, the most strongly associated with fibrinogen levels, approached genome-wide significance   $(\rlap/p\,=\,5.0\,\times\,10^{-7})$  . This SNP is located on  $\mathrm{Xq}25$  , with the closest gene, glutamate dehydrogenase 2 mitochondrial precursor ( GLUD2 ), positioned   $1.03~\mathrm{Mb}$   downstream.  

Creatinine, pro thro mb in fragments  $F_{I+\mathcal{D}}$   TAT, and TM. Results from the GWAS of creatinine, pro thro mb in fragments   $\mathrm{F}_{1+2}$  , TAT, and TM did not yield genome-wide significant associations (figure e-3). We did not identify significant associations in our data for previously published associations of these biomarkers. Table e-2 includes the most significant SNPs from each of these analyses.  

Replication of SNPs associated with each biomarker in prior GWAS.  CRP.  We replicated prior GWAS results including rs2794520   $(\phi\,=\,2.4~\times\,10^{-9})$  , previously associated with CRP levels in FHS   $(\rlap/p\ =\ 3.0\ \times$   $10^{-8}$  ), 16   an analysis of metabolic traits in a birth cohort from a founder population   $(\phi=3.0\times10^{-22}),^{17}$  7   and a meta-analysis of CRP levels in 80,000 participants   $\left(\phi=\begin{array}{r l}\end{array}\right)$   $2.0\ \times\ 10^{-186})^{-1}$  18   (table 3). Other replicated variants associated with CRP include rs876537   $(\phi\,=\,3.6\,\times$   $10^{-9}$  ), 19    $\mathrm{{rs}}7553007$     $(\phi~~=~~3.8~~\times~~10^{-9}),^{2}$  0   and rs1341665   $(\phi=5.2\times10^{-9})$  .   In addition to SNPs  

![](images/0fd5956ac137105c9d819015c577b033d29ce49f824981aabe272433088d0f0a.jpg)

within or near the    $C R P$   gene, we replicated associations between SNPs in  TOMM40 ,   HNF1A ,   LEPR ,   and  $A P O C I^{18}$    and CRP levels (table 3).  

Fibrinogen.  The most significantly associated SNPs in prior GWAS of fibrinogen were not genotyped or imputed in VISP. We therefore assessed genic-level replication across  LEPR  and FGB , which contained the top loci from 2 prior GWAS of fibrinogen levels.   SNPs within these genes showed association with fibrinogen in the VISP analysis (table 3).  

CRP levels and  CRP  SNPs are associated with recurrent stroke in VISP.  Using a basic model adjusting for interventional group only, we found that circulating CRP levels were associated with recurrent stroke in VISP  $(\phi\,=\,0.0007)$  . These findings remained significant in the adjusted model   $(\phi~=~0.0027)$  ). Individuals with CRP levels 1 SD above the population mean,  $9.86~\mathrm{mg/L}$  , had an approximate 1.25-fold increased risk of recurrent stroke in both models.  

In a fully adjusted model, we found that  CRP - associated SNPs, rs3093068, rs16842599, and rs11265260, were also associated with recurrent stroke in VISP (table 4) and confer a 1.8-fold increased risk for recurrent stroke. rs16842599 and rs11265260 are in complete LD with rs3093068  $\left(r^{2}\ \ =\ \ 1.0\right.$  ,   $\mathrm{~D~}=\ 1.0$  , 1000 G phase 1 EUR population).  

Fibrinogen levels are associated with recurrent stroke in VISP.  Similar to the CRP analyses, we found that circulating fibrinogen levels were associated with recurrent stroke in VISP   $\left(\rlap\slash p\right.=\left.0.001\right.$  , hazard ratio 1.26). These findings remained significant in the adjusted model   $(\rlap/p=\ 0.0129$  , hazard ratio 1.22). Individuals with fibrinogen levels   $1\;\;\mathrm{SD}$   above the population mean,   $400.21\ \mathrm{\meg/dL}$  , had an approximate 1.24- fold increased risk of recurrent stroke in both models. These data are consistent with previous findings that show increased risk for cerebro vascular events and fibrinogen levels but lack a genetic association.  

Shared genetic susceptibility and replication of incident ischemic stroke and  CRP .  All 3 SNPs found to be significantly associated with recurrent stroke were assed for association with incident ischemic stroke in a casecontrol analysis utilizing VISP (case) and High Density SNP Association Analysis of Melanoma (phs000187) (control). Associations were detected for all 3 SNPs and incident ischemic stroke, with rs3093068 showing the strongest association   $(\phi~=$   $5.95\,\times\,10^{-6})$   (table 4). We sought to replicate these findings in METASTROKE.   The METASTROKE data imputed to HapMap2 do not contain rs3093068, thus, we used proxy SNPs. We found that rs12068753 (  $~{\mathit{r}}^{2}~=~0.98$  , 1000 G Pilot, EUR) was significantly associated with small vessel disease in METASTROKE   $\mathit{\Omega}(\phi~=~0.027)$  . In fact, 5 of 11 proxy SNPs interrogated were found to be significantly associated with small vessel disease in METASTROKE (corrected  $\textit{p}<\,0.05)$  ) (table e-3). Another SNP rs16842559, in perfect LD with rs3093068, was associated with large vessel disease  $\left(\boldsymbol{\wp}=0.049\right)$  ). We found no associations between CRP SNPs and all ischemic stroke or card i oem boli c stroke in METASTROKE (table e-3).  

DISCUSSION  Searching for genetic determinants of human variation in biomarker levels in ischemic stroke cases, we detected associations between variants within the    $C R P$   locus and CRP levels at a genome-wide significance level, and replicated prior GWAS associations for CRP and fibrinogen. Additionally, we identified a novel association between 2 SNPs at  $\mathrm{Ch}7\mathrm{q}33$   and serum CRP measures that approached genome-wide significance; however, this association was not replicated.  

CRP binds to the surface of dead or dying cells to activate the complement system via the C1Q complex and initiate the innate immune response.

CRP is also known to play a fundamental role in the pathogen es is of atherosclerosis. – 28   Elevated highsensitivity CRP level is a known risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease. – 31   We show that elevated CRP levels were associated with recurrent stroke risk. Three CRP-associated SNPs, rs3093068, rs16842599, and rs11265260, were also found to be associated with recurrent stroke in VISP, indicating a new and potentially clinically relevant connection between genetic determinants of    $C R P$   and recurrent stroke risk. In case-control analyses, we also found that these same SNPs were associated with overall ischemic stroke risk. Replication attempts in METASTROKE yielded encouraging results and refined potential mechanisms since associations were restricted to small vessel disease (rs12068753) and large vessel disease (rs16842559).  CRP  regulatory region variants have been associated with ischemic stroke in Han Chinese 32   and reside in known regions of significance in African Americans and Hispanic Americans.   The VISP trial ’ s entry criteria excluded the majority of card i oem boli c strokes and operable large vessel carotid disease, so our association with predominantly small vessel disease strokes in VISP contrasts with the EuroCLOT study results that identified this same SNP as associated with large vessel, cardioembolic, and overall stroke.   Acute elevation of CRP levels is associated with plaque rupture. However, an association between CRP SNPs and small vessel disease in METASTROKE suggests that the association is not driven by acute plaque rupture.  

Our association between SNP rs2592902, in the  CRP  gene, and CRP levels is novel. This SNP is an eQTL for CRP mRNA levels in whole blood as per the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) (figure e-3).   The other 5 CRP GWASassociated SNPs are located in a region not previously associated with circulating CRP levels, potentially indicating a novel region of  CRP  regulation. We replicated other loci previously associated with CRP levels, including TOMM40, HNF1A ,  LEPR , and  APOC1  (table 3). The recapi- tulation of these previously reported associations in our poststroke population provides a measure of confidence in our novel results and extends our

understanding of genetic determinants of CRP levels during the subacute phase after ischemic stroke.  

We identified a novel association approaching significance between 7p33 (the closest gene,  AKR1D1 , is  $62.5~\mathrm{~kb~}$   upstream) and CRP levels.  AKR1D1  is responsible for catalyzing   $5–\upbeta$  -reduction of bile acid intermediates and steroid hormones carrying a  d (4)- 3-1 structure.   Homozygous mutations in  AKR1D1 cause bile acid synthesis defect, congenital, 2 (MIM 235555),   and  AKR1D1  is also associated with hepatic dysfunction.   Functional evaluation using the GTEx dataset shows that in liver the top 2 SNPs at the  AKR1D1  locus, rs2465086 and rs2589998, are eQTLs for CRP gene expression   $\left(\boldsymbol{\phi}\right.=\left.0.02\right.$   and  $\mathscr{p}=$  0.03, respectively), indicating a novel link between these genes and the biology of CRP function (figure e-3). Whole blood data for  AKR1D1  are not available through GTEx. However, we were unable to replicate our genetic findings, indicating that further genetic studies will be necessary to confirm this finding.  

The potential clinical importance of our CRP findings is further enhanced by the possibility of shared genetic susceptibility with vascular disease. We identified 3 SNPs — rs3093068, rs16842599, and rs11265260 — associated with incident ischemic stroke, recurrent stroke, and stroke subtypes. These findings are critical to our understanding of genetic risk for vascular disease and could prove useful in risk stratification for prevention of both incident and recurrent stroke.  

We continued to investigate how vascular biomarkers may be influenced by genetic drivers in VISP by performing a genome-wide analysis of fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is an essential part of the blood coagulation process and a known marker of inflammation. Elevated fibrinogen levels have consistently been associated with an increased risk for both stroke and cardiovascular disease.   We confirmed the association of genetic variability in the leptin receptor ( LEPR ) and the fibrinogen  $\upbeta$   chain   $(F G B)$   genes with fibrinogen levels. The  LEPR gene protein product is functional mainly within adipose tissue and helps to regulate the hunger/satiation balance. The  FGB  gene is a component of the active fibrinogen molecule. Both of these genes warrant follow-up as their potential impact on vascular risk and repair could be essential.  

We found that fibrinogen levels are associated with recurrent stroke in both unadjusted and adjusted models. In contrast to    $C R P$  , no SNPs reached genome-wide significance for fibrinogen and thus were not assessed for association with ischemic stroke or recurrent stroke risk. This has been seen in a previous GWAS of fibrinogen.  

The GWAS for creatinine, pro thro mb in fragments  $\mathrm{F}_{1+2}\mathrm{:$  , TAT, and TM failed to identify significant genetic associations. We were unable to replicate prior GWAS associations for plasma creatinine measures. Our analyses represent unique GWAS of   $\mathrm{F}_{1+2}$  , TAT, and TM that have no prior GWAS to attempt replication.  

Limitations of our study include the low proportion of individuals from non-European descent, potentially limiting general iz ability. Generally, GWAS are limited because of their lacking predictive power for the phenotype of interest, ability to singularly identify causative variants because of linkage d is equilibrium especially in the case of rare SNPs, and inability to be reproduced across different populations. Additionally, stroke subtype information is not available for VISP. METASTROKE results suggest that subtype data may be relevant to explain observed associations.  

Strengths include an extremely well-phenotyped study population in VISP, although stroke subtype information is lacking, paired with   $1000\ \mathrm{G}$   imputed genetic data. These data enabled us to take a broad approach to investigating how known biomarkers of vascular disease may be functioning at both the genetic and biological levels of disease in stroke populations

 (VISP, METASTROKE) and the general population

 (FHS). Using a comprehensive approach, we generated our primary data, reviewed previously reported analyses, cross-referenced these studies, and investigated how this information may lead to a better understanding of clinical vascular risk. This study also buffers many of the general concerns of GWAS because of our foundation in known biological mechanisms of stroke risk, replication across different studies, and the functional evidence present in our eQTL analyses. Biomarkers are important in prediction of disease susceptibility, outcomes, treatment response, and recovery. Our data provide confirmation of genetic associations for CRP and fibrinogen in the setting of ischemic stroke. We also show a novel putative association of variants on 7q33 and CRP levels, which requires independent replication, possibly in populations like VISP as FHS is distinctly different. Our results demonstrate that CRPassociated variants across multiple loci influence CRP levels in the acute phase following ischemic stroke, and that there are shared genetic factors between CRP and ischemic stroke risk and recurrent stroke risk. Confirming previous work, we show that elevated fibrinogen levels are associated with ischemic stroke. Evaluation of replication pointed to specific subtypes at highest risk. In total, these analyses demonstrate that known and novel variants contribute to biomarker levels following ischemic stroke, and knowledge of these factors can provide important new information in evaluating risk for cerebro vascular disease.

# STUDY FUNDING  

Study recruitment and collection of datasets for the VISP trial were supported by a grant (R01 NS34447; PI James Toole) from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). GWAS genotyping performed at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) (U01 HG004438l; PI David Valle) was funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute and the Genomics and Randomized Trials (GARNET) Network (U01HG00516-03; co-PI Michèle M. Sale and Bradford B. Worrall) and genetic data cleaning was provided by the GARNET Coordinating Center (U 01 HG 005157; PI Bruce S. Weir). Given that all VISP participants were stroke cases, we obtained GWAS data (dbGAP) for external controls from the High Density SNP Association Analysis of Melanoma: Case-Control and Outcomes Investigation (study accession: phs000187.v1.p1); they were also genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad by CIDR.
