Abstract:  We recruited 560 unrelated patients with ischemic stroke and 153 unrelated controls  to undertake a genetic analysis for association between the NOS3 gene and ischemic stroke. All  the subjects were Chinese of Han descent. Because the NOS3 gene spans about  $21\;\mathrm{k}\mathrm{b}$   of DNA  and contains 26 exons, we selected a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3918181, an  A to G base change located in intron 14 of the gene, as a DNA marker. PCR-based restriction  fragment length polymorphism analysis was applied to genotype rs3918181 (RsaI site). The  chi-square   $(\chi^{2})$   goodness-of-ﬁ t test showed that the genotypic distributions of the marker  were not deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the patient group   $(\chi^{2}=0.166$  ,   ${\mathsf{p}}=0.684)$   and the control group   $(\chi^{2}\!=\!0.421$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\,{=}\,0.517$  ). The cocaphase analysis showed allelic  association of rs3918181 with ischemic stroke in males   $(\chi^{2}=4.04$  ,  ${\mathsf{p}}=0.044$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}=1.43$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}~1.01{\sim}2.02)$   and frequency of allele A was signiﬁ cantly higher in male patients than male  control subjects. The  $\chi^{2}$   test revealed genotypic association between rs3918181 and ischemic  stroke in males   $(\chi^{2}\,{=}\,4.26$  ,  $\mathrm{df}=1$  ,  ${\mathsf{p}}\,{=}\,0.039$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}=1.61$  ,  $95\%\operatorname{CI}1.02\!\sim\!\!2.53)$   but not in females.  The present work suggests that rs3918181 is associated with ischemic stroke in male patients.  This ﬁ nding gives further evidence in support of the eNOS association with ischemic stroke  in the Chinese population.

# Introduction  

Nitric oxide (NO) is known to have several important vasculo-protective effects  (El-Mas et al 1997; Gürdal et al 2005). Reduced production of NO may lead to  atherosclerosis (Lüscher and Vanhoutte 1990; Harrison 1997; Shimokawa 1999).  The synthesis of NO from the amino acid,  L -arginine, is catalysed by NO synthase 

 (NOS). NO then plays a critical role in the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells 

 (VSMCs). It is well known that NO is involved in reducing VSMC proliferation,  adhesion of platelets and leukocytes (Moncada and Higgs 1993; Draijer et al 1995;  Myers and Tanner 1998; Brocq et al 2008). NO is likely, therefore, to be an important  contributory factor in the pathogen es is of some forms of stroke.  

There are 3 distinct isoforms of NOS identiﬁ ed in humans: endo the li al (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). eNOS is a highly regulated isoform that  is expressed primarily in endo the li al cells. It synthesizes very low levels NO under basal  conditions (Lüscher and Vanhoutte 1990; Harrison 1997; Shimokawa 1999). Because  eNOS plays a central role in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis, including regulation of the cerebral circulation, a number of studies have been conducted to investigate  the genetic association between the eNOS gene and the incidence of ischemic stroke.  Howard and colleagues (2005) detected 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  in the promoter region, 1 in exon 7 (G894T) and 1 insertion/deletion polymorphism  within intron 4 among 110 cases with ischemic stroke and 206 controls. They found  strong associations of both the  − 922 G-A and  − 786 T-C SNPs with ischemic stroke.  

Hou and colleagues (2001) were the ﬁ rst to report the genetic  association between the eNOS gene and ischemic stroke in  a Chinese population and a recent work has conﬁ rmed the  intial ﬁ nding (Berger et al 2007) although the eNOS association failed to be replicated in a Japanese population (Yahashi  et al 1998). This study might have been hampered by poor  replication, a common problem with genetic analysis. Linkage d is equilibrium (LD) structure and sample power may be  one of major reasons for poor replication of an initial ﬁ nding.  Therefore, the present study was designed to apply a large  sample size to investigate genetic association between the  eNOS gene and ischemic stroke.  

# Materials and methods  

The present study recruited 560 unrelated patients with  ischemic stroke and 153 unrelated controls in order to undertake a genetic analysis for association between the NOS3  gene and ischemic stroke. All the subjects used for this  study were Chinese of Han descent. Patients with ischemic  stroke were admitted to the First Hospital of Jilin University,  Changchun, China in the period between 2005 and 2006. They  were diagnosed as having ischemic stroke independently by at  least two well-trained neurologists based on strict neurological  examination, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance  imaging, which meet the  International Classiﬁ cation of  Diseases  (NCHS 2007). Detailed information regarding their  medical history, medication and clinical presentation was  taken through either their close relatives or themselves. Of  these 560 patients (398 males and 162 females), 426 were suffering from simple lacunar infarction, 246 from large-vessel  infarction and 112 from both. Those with hemorrhagic stroke  were not included in this study. The general information of  the subjects recruited is given in Table 1.  

All the subjects gave written informed consent for the  genetic analysis. The whole blood sample was taken from  them for extraction of genomic DNA. The study was granted  prior approval by the ethics committee of Jilin University,  Changchun, China.  

To perform genetic analysis, we selected SNP rs3918181  (Rsa I site) as a genetic marker at the NOS3 locus. It is  an A to G base change present in intron 14 of the gene.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based restriction fragment  length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed to  genotype rs3918181. Genomic DNA used for PCR ampliﬁ cation was extracted from the whole blood sample using a DNA  extraction kit (Promega, Beijing, China). PCR ampliﬁ cation  was performed in a  $25{\mathrm{-}}\upmu1$   reaction volume containing  $10\,\mathrm{mM}$    Tris-HCl   $\mathrm{(pH~8.3)}$  ),   $50~\mathrm{mM}$   KCl,   $1.5\ \mathrm{mM}\ \mathrm{MgC}12$  ,   $0.001\%$   

 (w/v) gelatin,  $200\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   of each dNTP,  $0.4\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   of each primer, 

 1.0 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Beijing, China),  and  ${30{-}50}\,\mathrm{ng}$   of genomic DNA. The conditions used for PCR  ampliﬁ cation included an initial de natura tion at   $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $5\;\mathrm{min}$  , followed by 35–40 cycles of   $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 45s,  $55{-}60~^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$    for 1 min and   $72\ ^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\ \mathrm{min}$  , and a ﬁ nal elongation at   $72\,^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\;\mathrm{{min}}$  . A  $15{\mathrm{-}}{\upmu}{\mathrm{l}}$   aliquot of the PCR products was  completely digested with 6–8 units of restriction enzymes.  The digested PCR products were then separated on ethidium  bromide-stained agarose gels.  

The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the genotypic  distributions of rs3918181 was tested using the chi-square   $(\chi^{2})$   goodness-of-ﬁ t test. Applied to test sample power for  individual alleles was tested using the SPSS Sample Power  2.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The  signiﬁ cance level was be set at   $5\%$   (two-tailed). Allelic  association was tested by the COCAPHASE module of the  UNPHASED program (Dudbridge 2003) and genotypic  association was tested by the SPSS program for windows  15.0 (SPSS Inc.).  

# Results  

The  $\chi^{2}$   goodness-of-ﬁ t test showed that the genotypic distributions of rs3918181 were not deviated from Hardy-Weinberg

equilibrium in both the patient group   $(\chi^{2}\!=\!0.166$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\,{=}\,0.684$  )  and the control group   $(\chi^{2}\!=\!0.421,{\tt p}\!=\!0.517)$  . These 560 case  and 153 control samples gave a power of   $60\%$   for detection  of small effect size and  $100\%$   for detection of medium effect  size. Analysis with the COCAPHASE program showed that  rs3918181 was associated with ischemic stroke in males   $(\chi^{2}=4.04$  ,  ${\tt p}=0.044$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}=1.43$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}~1.01\small{\sim}2.02\$  ) and  frequency of allele A of rs3918181 was signiﬁ cantly higher in  male patients than male control subjects (Table 2). However,  female patients did not show such an association (Table 2).  As shown in Table 3, the   $\chi^{2}$   test revealed genotypic association between rs3918181 and ischemic stroke in males   $\mathrm{X}^{2}\!=\!4.26$  , df  $\mathit{\dot{\Theta}}=1$  ,  ${\mathsf{p}}\,{=}\,0.039$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}=1.61$  ,  $95\%\,\mathrm{CI}\,1.02{\sim}2.53$  )  but not the genotypic association was not observed in female  subjects.  

# Discussion  

The gene coding for eNOS is mapped to the long arm of  chromosome 7 (7q36) and spans   ${\sim}21~\mathrm{Rb}$   of DNA, although  it contains 26 exons. It should be sufﬁ cient to capture a  linkage d is equilibrium (LD) signal by genotyping a highly  polymorphic DNA marker present in the middle of the gene.  SNP rs3918181 is located in intron 14 of the gene and has  he ter oz y gos it y of 0.43. It may be an ideal DNA marker for  association studies in a Chinese population.  

The present work showed that rs3918181 was associated  with ischemic stroke in male patients. This ﬁ nding gives  further evidence in support of the eNOS association with  ischemic stroke in the Chinese population, although female  patients did not show such an association in our samples  (Tables 2 and 3). It is worth investigating the gender differences with more samples in a further study.  

We recruited a total of 153 control subjects in this  study. The sample power test indicates that the study is

not sufﬁ ciently powered at present for detection of small  effect-size gene. However, we will continue to collect controls matched for age, sex and ethnicity in order to conﬁ rm  the results and  $80\%$   of power will be needed for combined  samples in our future study.
