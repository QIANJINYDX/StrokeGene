Abstract : Stroke is the major cause of death and disability worldwide. ABCA1 R219K has been suggested as  a risk factor for ischemic stroke, but the results remain  inconclusive in the Chinese population. This study aimed  to assess the association between ABCA1 R219K and  ischemic stroke using meta-analysis. A systematic litera- ture search was conducted to select eligible studies and  the pooled odds ratio (OR) with   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate the strength of association.  Fourteen studies containing 2865 cases and 3227 controls  were included in the meta-analysis and the results suggested that there is a strong association between ABCA1  R219K and the ischemic stroke risks (K vs. R:  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.837,$   $95\%$   CI: 0.735- 0.954,   $\mathtt{p{=}}0.008$  ; KK vs. RR:  $\mathrm{OR}=0.689$  ,   $95\%$  CI: 0.520-0.912,  $\mathsf{p{=}0.009}$  ;   $\mathrm{KK+REK}$   vs. RR:   $\mathrm{OR}=0.782$  ,  $95\%$  CI: 0.691-0.885,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.001\!$  ). Subgroup analysis revealed that  significant association was found for the 4 genetic models   $\left(\mathsf{p}\!<\!0.05\right)$   in the Southern population, while in the northern  population significant association was only found under  the dominant model (  $\mathrm{KK+RK}$   vs. RR:  $\mathrm{{OR}=0.744}$  ,   $95\%$   CI:  0.583- 0.949,   $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.017.$  ). This meta-analysis suggested that  ABCA1 R219K polymorphism might be a protective factor  against developing IS, indicating this SNP may contribute to the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke and might be  potentially used as a biomarker to predict the sus ce pti bility to ischemic stroke.

# 1  Introduction  

Stroke is a common but serious cerebral vascular condition, and it is estimated to cause   $5\%$   of disability and   $10\%$   of deaths worldwide [1]. The lifetime risk of stroke is  now  $25\%$   from the age of 25 years globally. Ischemic stroke  (IS) is the main type of stroke, which accounts for more  than  $70\%$   of the stroke [2]. In particular, the highest estimated lifetime risk of stroke is found in East Asia and it  has become the leading cause of mortality in China [3].  Although both the environmental and genetic factors  contribute to the pathogen es is of IS, the precise etiology  of IS has not been completely elucidated yet [4]. Several  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and large collaborative efforts have been devoted to explore the genetic  risk factors of IS, and many genetic variants such as  PITX2 and  ZFHX3  have been identified [5]. However, these genes  only account for a portion of the overall genetic risk and  the genetic risk factors may vary among populations.  More studies on the genetic factors of IS, in particular, in  individual populations are still required.  

It is well accepted that the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level is an independent risk  factor of vascular disease with the increased HDL-C  providing a protective effect against vascular disease  incidence. ATP binding cassette subfamily A member  1(ABCA1) is a key regulator of cholesterol efflux and plays  a pivotal role in the synthesis of HDL-C and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) [6]. The ABCA1 gene is located at  chromosome 9q31.1, which encompasses 50 exons and  encodes a product containing 2261 amino acids. A recent  meta-analysis has shown that ABCA1 gene variation is  associated with elevated blood lipid levels, especially the  HDL-C [7]. Genetic polymorphisms within ABCA1 have  been identified as the molecular basis of Tangier disease  and familial hypo alpha lipoprotein emi a [8, 9]. Additionally, ABCA1 gene mutations have also been associated  with decreased risk factors for coronary artery disease  (CAD), another common vascular condition [10]. Hence, it  was reasonable to hypothesize that gene polymorphisms  in ABCA1 might affect the risks of IS.  

R219K in exon 7, also known as rs2230806, is a  common variation of the ABCA1 gene. The G to A substitution causes the change from Arg to Lysine at 219 site of the  peptide. Although the impacts of protein function caused  by this mutation is not clear, genetic studies have found  that R219K variation is associated with either increased  HDL-C and/or decreased risk of CAD [11]. Another study  found that the ABCA1 R219K cloud modulate the association between HDL-C and age in Caucasians [12]. However,  whether ABCA1 R219K is associated with the risks of IS has  not been determined. In Caucasians, studies on the association between ABCA1 R219K and IS generated inconclusive results. And riko vic s and colleagues found a protective role of ABCA1 R219K in stroke in Hungarian patients  [10]. However, Pasdar and colleagues found marginal difference in the ABCA1 R219K allele frequency in case and  controls [13].  

Abundant  studies have also been performed to  investigate such an association in the Chinese population. Xiao and colleagues first reported the ABCA1 R219K  might be a protective factor for IS in a Southern Chinese  population [14]. Notably, these findings were further confirmed by  subsequent studies [15, 16], while others found  ABCA1 R219K might increase the IS risks or lack  association [17, 18]. The controversial results of associations  between ABCA1 R219K and IS susceptibility may due to  the relatively small sample size in the individual studies.  Meta-analysis is a powerful tool to combine the results  from individual studies and increase the power of obtaining a more precise conclusion. However, the meta-analysis of multiple populations may be affected by different  genetic background. In order to reduce effects of these  confounding factors, we focus our attention on the association between ABCA1 R219K and IS in the Chinese population and also perform the subgroup analysis based on the  region of the population.  

# 2  Methods  

# 2.1  Literature search and inclusion criteria  

The relevant literature, published before August 2019,  was searched across the electronic database of Pubmed,  WangFang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure  (CNKI) in English or Chinese. The following key terms  were used for the literature searching: “ischemic stroke”, 

 “cerebro vascular accident”, “cerebro vascular disease”, 

 “cerebral infarction”, “polymorphism”, “gene mutation”  and “ABCA1”. A manual search was also carried out on the  references of the literature to identify  additional eligible  studies.  

The following criteria was used to select  eligible  studies for the meta-analysis: (1) studies evaluating the  association between ABCA1 and ischemic stroke; (2)  studies containing data from the Chinese population;  (3) Clear diagnosis of ischemic stroke patients; (4) R219K  polymorphism was genotyped and detailed frequency  data available. Accordingly, studies that did not meet  the above criteria were excluded. If there was more than  one case-control study reported, they were treated independently.  

# 2.2  Data extraction  

Two authors performed the data extraction independently  and any disagreements were resolved by discussion with  a third author. Following information was extracted from  the included studies: the surname of the first author,  year of publication, region of the study (South or North  China), numbers of controls and cases, genotype methods  and distribution of alleles and genotypes. Additionally, P  values of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test for the  controls were also extracted or calculated based on the  genotype data.  

# 2.3  Statistical analysis  

The meta-analysis was performed as previously reported  [19]. The analysis was carried out using STATA statistical  software (Version 12.0; Stata Corporation, College Station,  TX, USA). The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with   $95\%$   confi- dence intervals (CIs) were employed to estimate the association between R219K and ischemic stroke risk. During  the ORs calculation, four genetic models were used:  additive model (K vs. R), recessive model (KK vs.   $\mathrm{RR+RR}$  ),  homozygotes model (KK vs. RR), and dominant model (KK   $^+$   RK versus RR). A random model was used in the pooled  ORs calculation. The significance of pooled ORs was evaluated by the Z test and a   $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05$   (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant. The potential heterogeneity  among studies was assessed by the I 2  test and   $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.1$   for  the I 2  was considered statistically significant for the heterogeneity test. The Begg’s and Egger’s test were employed  to test the potential publication bias and   $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05$   indicated significant publication bias. In addition, the funnel  plot was also drawn based on the Begg’s test. Subgroup  meta-analysis was also performed based on the region of  population and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test.  

# 3  Results  

# 3.1  Characteristics of included studies  

Through literature searching, 68 publications relevant  to ABCA1 gene and ischemic stroke were identified. Follow-up title and/or abstract reading excluded 42 studies  as they were irrelevant to the meta-analysis. After further  abstract reading, 11 studies were excluded because there  was no data from Chinese population   $\left(\mathtt{n}\!\!-\!\!3\right)$  ), no R219K  data, and not case control studies (  $\tt(n{=}2)$  ). Subsequently,  full texts readings were performed on the 15 studies and 1  study was further excluded due to duplicated data. Finally,  14 studies, containing 2865 cases and 3227 controls, investigating the PD-L1 R219K   $_{\mathrm{C>G}}$   and the risks of ischemic  stroke were included in the present meta-analysis (Fig. 1)  [14–18, 20–28]. As shown in Table 1, the publication year  varied from 2014 to 2015, and the genotype distributions  in the controls were in agreement with  HWE, except for  one study.  

# 3.2  Meta-analysis and heterogeneity test  

As shown in Table 2, ABCA1 R219K was significantly associated with ischemic stroke for the allelic model (K vs. R:   $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.837,$     $95\%$   CI: 0.735- 0.954,   $\mathtt{p{=}}0.008$  ), the homozygotic model (KK vs. RR:   $\mathrm{OR}=0.689$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.520-0.912, 

  $\mathtt{p{=}0.009}$  ) and the dominant model   $(\mathrm{KK+REK}$  vs. RR: OR 

  $\qquad=\;0.782$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.691-0.885,   $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!0.001\!$  ) (Fig. 2), but not  the recessive model (KK vs.   $\mathrm{&&+RR}$  :   $\mathrm{OR=}0.772$  ,   $95\%$   CI:   $0.594–1.003$  ,   $\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.053,$  ). As the control population of one  study deviated from HWE, this study was omitted in the  further analysis but there was still significant association  between ABCA1 R219K with ischemic stroke for 3 genetic  models (  $\scriptstyle(\mathtt{p}<005)$  ). P values from I2 test were used to detect

the potential heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity were found for the allelic model, the homo zy got ic  model and the recessive model   $\scriptstyle(\mathtt{p}<0.001)$  ) but not for the  dominant model   $\scriptstyle(\mathtt{p}<0.294)$  . These results indicate that  allele K might be a protective factor for ischemic stroke,  but heterogeneity  exist in the included populations.  

By considering that genetic background between  Southern and Northern Chinese population might be  different, stratified analysis was conducted based on  the region of the study. In the Southern population, significant association was found for the 4 genetic models   $\left(\mathtt{p}\!<\!0.05\right)$  ); in the northern population, significant association was found under the dominant model (  $\mathrm{KK+RK}$   vs.  RR:   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,0.744}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.583- 0.949,   $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.017]$  ), but not  under the allelic model, homo zy got ic model and recessive  model   $\mathrm{(p{>}0.05)}$  ). However, heterogeneity were still found  in the allelic model, the homo zy got ic model and the  recessive model   $\left(\mathsf{p}\!<\!0.05\right)$   in both Southern and Northern  populations. Taking together, the meta-analysis revealed  that ABCA1  $\mathrm{KK+REK}$   carriers might have decreased risk of  ischemic stroke in Chinese populations.  

# 3.3  Publication bias  

Begg’s funnel plots and Egger’s tests were employed to  evaluate the potential publication bias. The results of  Begg’s and Egger’s tests are shown in Table 2 and a funnel  plot under the dominant model (Fig. 3). Studies in the  funnel plots were symmetrically distributed in the overall  meta-analysis under all genetic models   $\mathrm{(p{>}0.05)}$  , suggesting the absence of publication bias for the meta-analysis  of ischemic stroke risks.  

# 3.4  Sensitivity Analysis  

Sensitivity analysis was performed by replicating the  analysis after omitting one study at a time to evaluate the  effect of quality of studies on the final findings. A representative picture for the dominant model is shown in Fig.  4. The results found that the meta-analysis of the correlation between the ABCA1 R219K and ischemic stroke sus- ce pti bil it y remained unchanged in all genetic models.

# 4  Discussion  

ABCA1 plays an important role in the development of  IS. ABCA1 is a major regulator of cellular and systemic  cholesterol homeostasis. It is widely expressed and contributes to reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by exporting cholesterol out of cells to extracellular acceptors to  form HDL-C. Through the above mentioned RCT, ABCA1  exerts its protective role in atherosclerosis (AS), which is  believed to be an initial step in the IS pathogen es is. R219K  is a common variation in the ABCA1 gene. Several studies  investigated the association between ABCA1 R219K and  IS susceptibility in Chinese population, but the results  are inconsistent. The present meta-analysis included 14  eligible original studies containing the data of 2865 cases  and 3227 controls. The main findings of this meta-analysis  are that the allele K might be a protective factor for the  IS and the ABCA1   $\mathrm{KK+REK}$   carriers might have decreased  risk of ischemic stroke in Chinese populations. Subgroup  meta-analysis shows a stronger association between  ABCA1 R219K and IS in the Southern Chinese population  than the Northern Chinese populations.  

Hou and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis on the  association between ABCA1 R219K and IS in the Chinese  population in 2014 [29]. This study included 1619 IS cases  and 1907 controls of 9 publications. The results showed  that ABCA1 R219K was associated with IS in all genetic  models except the recessive genetic model. However,  five years have passed and more studies on the Chinese  populations have been published. Through the literature  search, 5 new publications were identified [22, 24–27]. The  numbers of cases and controls increased to 2865 and 3227  respectively in the present meta-analysis. We also found  that the allele K of ABCA1 R219K might be a protective  factor for  IS and, particularly, the   $\mathrm{KK+REK}$  carriers might  have decreased risk of ischemic stroke in Chinese populations. Our results provided  more convincing evidence for  a protective role of ABCA1 R219Kin IS in a larger Chinese  population.  

More recently, a meta-analysis was carried out in  the Asian and Caucasian populations and have found  that homozygous RR of R219K was significantly associated with increased IS risk   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.31\$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.16-1.48;   $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.001\big)$   [30], which is consistent with our finding that  ABCA1   $\mathrm{KK+RK}$   carriers might have decreased risk of  ischemic stroke. However, the subgroup analysis revealed  that such association was presented in  Asian populations, but not in  Caucasian populations, suggesting the

![](images/9e58e286e718aae7e284d60abbcb363e42d88abc0be37e5611281f68b21d2203.jpg)  

heterogeneity among the populations may affect the association between ABCA1 gene polymorphism and IS. In the  present meta-analysis, a modest difference was found  between the Southern and the Northern Chinese population, indicating the potential heterogeneity may also  existed in  Asian groups. In addition, only two Caucasian  studies were identified and included in the meta-analysis  of Au and colleagues, such lack of association between  ABCA1 R219K and IS may also be due to the limited study  numbers. More studies are needed to clarify whether there  is an association between ABCA1 R219K and IS in  Caucasians.  

Another question is how to explain the protective  role of ABCA1 R219K in IS risk in the Chinese population.  It is generally accepted that HDL-C is a protective factor  against vascular disease . As a kind of cerebral vascular  condition, increased serum HDL-C has been linked to   decreased IS risk. Recent studies found that ABCA1 gene  polymorphisms are associated with elevated blood lipid  levels, in particular, the serum HDL-C levels. Considering the important regulatory role of ABCA1 in cholesterol  homeostasis, it is likely that the protective role of ABCA1  R219K in IS is due to the elevated HDL-C. However, how  the R219K variation affects the function of ABCA1 protein  is unclear,  and requires much more investigation in the  future.  

The present meta-analysis should be interpreted with  caution due to several limitations. First, we only focused  on R219K variation in the ABCA1 gene, while  not evaluating other genes or environmental factors. It is possible  that the potential roles of ABCA1 R219K are diluted or  masked by other gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Second, we only conducted the meta-analysis in the  Chinese population, and so far only 2 studies have been  published in  Caucasians populations. Whether there is  such association in  Caucasian populations merits further  investigations. The last but not the least, heterogeneity  still exists even if we perform  subgroup analysis based  on the region of the Chinese populations. The association  between ABCA1 R219K and IS should considered with  caution when applied to a specific population.

# 5  Conclusion  

This meta-analysis suggests that ABCA1 R219K polymorphism might be a protective factor against developing IS.  However, the strength of association might vary among  populations, and larger and well-designed studies are  warranted to validate our findings.
