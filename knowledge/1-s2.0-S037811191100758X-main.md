Background:  rs2943634 C/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), located in a non coding region of chromosome  $2\mathrm{q}36.3$  , has been associated with coronary artery disease in two genome wide association studies. Our goal was to investigate its relation with myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke (IS), as well as  

with 12 intermediate risk phenotypes, in a population-based prospective cohort study. Methods:  rs2943634 was genotyped in a case – cohort study including a random sample of 1891 individuals

 (subcohort) and all incident MI   $(\mathrm{n}\!=\!211$  ) and IS   $(\mathrm{n}\!=\!144]$  ) cases during a mean follow-up of   $8.2\pm$  2.2 years, nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam cohort comprising 27,548 middle-aged men and women. Results:  rs2943634 minor allele (A) was associated in an additive fashion with lower risk of IS but not with MI

 [hazard ratio   $(\mathrm{HR})\,{=}\,0.66$  ;   $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval (CI): 0.50 – 0.87;  $\mathrm{P\!=\!}0.003$  ;  $\mathrm{HR}\,{=}\,1.02$  ;   $95\%$   CI: 0.82 – 1.28;

  $\mathrm{P\!=\!}0.83$   respectively, for the age and sex adjusted model]. Furthermore, it was related to slightly higher levels of plasma a dip one ct in [CC 6.94, CA 7.27, AA   $7.86\,\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$  ,   $\mathrm{P}\!=\!0.0002]$  ] and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (CC 52.08, CA 53.05 and AA   $55.27\,\mathrm{mg/d l}$  ,   $\mathrm{P}\!=\!0.002]$  ), based on additive models. Adjustment for a dip one ct in and HDL-cholesterol did not attenuate the association between the SNP and IS risk. In contrast, adjustment for a dip one ct in abolished the association between the SNP and HDL-cholesterol and adjustment for HDL-cholesterol attenuated the association between the SNP and a dip one ct in. Conclusions:  Our  ﬁ ndings suggest that rs2943634 is associated with IS risk and with plasma levels of HDLcholesterol and a dip one ct in in this German population. Further investigations are needed to con ﬁ rm these results and to clarify the mechanisms underlying the association.

# 1. Introduction  

rs2943634 C/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located in a non coding region on chromosome 2 at 2q36.3, however the Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) Study, which enrolled 1926 coronary artery disease (CAD) cases and 2938 controls of white European origin, imputed an association between its most frequent allele (C) and CAD ( Samani et al., 2007 ). Authors could reproduce the association in the German myocardial family study which involved 875 myocardial infarction (MI) cases and 1644 controls ( Samani et al., 2007 ), however, further replication studies have not been able to con ﬁ rm this association ( Bressler et al., 2010; Ghazouani et al., 2010; Karvanen et al., 2009; Muendlein et al., 2009; Samani et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011 ). Ischemic stroke (IS) shares common ph y sio pathological mechanisms with MI due to athero sclerotic disease ( Faxon et al., 2004 ). Thus rs2943634 has also been investigated on its relationship with IS ( Karvanen et al., 2009 )  

and carotid artery intima-media thickness, a sub clinical marker of atherosclerosis associated with stroke ( Cunnington et al., 2009 ), with no signi ﬁ cant results. Association data between rs2943634 and intermediate risk phenotypes of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is scarce and inconsistent ( Cunnington et al., 2009; Karvanen et al., 2009; Samani et al., 2007 ), although signi ﬁ cant associations have been reported with body mass index (BMI) ( Samani et al., 2007 ), blood pressure ( Karvanen et al., 2009 ), low density lipoprotein

 (LDL)-cholesterol ( Samani et al., 2007 ) and high density lipoprotein

 (HDL)-cholesterol ( Karvanen et al., 2009 ). In the present study our goal was to investigate the association of rs2943634 with MI, IS, both CVD combined, and with intermediate risk phenotypes that may implicate causal pathways, in a middle-aged population.  

# 2. Methods  

# 2.1. Study population  

The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam cohort comprises 27,548 men and women from the general population of the Potsdam area in Germany, mainly aged 35 – 65 years at recruitment (1994 – 1998) ( Boeing et al., 1999 ). The associations of rs2943634 with risk of MI, IS and CVD were analyzed using a case – cohort design. With this type of study design, the results are expected to be general iz able to the entire cohort ( Kulathinal et al., 2007; Prentice and Self, 1988 ). The study population included a random sample of 2500 individuals (subcohort) and all newly occurred MI and IS cases from the EPIC-Potsdam cohort veri ﬁ ed during a mean follow-up of   $8.2\pm2.2$   years. Identi ﬁ cation and veri ﬁ cation of incident cases have been described in detail before ( Weikert et al., 2008 ). Of individuals who had both, MI and IS, we considered only the  ﬁ rst event. After exclusion of individuals with a history of MI or IS at baseline, and those without fully obtained follow-up data or with missing biomarkers, covariates or genotype data, the  ﬁ nal study population comprised a subcohort of 1891 participants and a total of 211 MI cases and 144 IS cases (21 MI cases and 20 IS cases belonging to the subcohort). Participants were not required to be fasted at the baseline assessment, however, 655 individuals did not eat for at least  $8\,\mathrm{h}$   before the blood drawing. The subcohort was used in a crosssectional study to investigate the association between rs2943634 alleles and the following cardiovascular intermediate risk phenotypes: BMI, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDLcholesterol, triglycerides (TG), glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a dip one ct in and creatinine. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants, and approval was given by the Ethical Committee of the State of Brandenburg, Germany.  

# 2.2. Biochemical and genetic analyses  

At baseline  $30\,\mathrm{ml}$   of venous blood was collected from all the study participants, it was fraction a ted into serum, plasma, buffy coat and erythrocytes and stored in liquid nitrogen until the time of analysis. All biomarkers were analyzed between 2007 and 2008 at the Internal Medicine Department of the University of Tübingen, Germany. Plasma levels of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, TG, hs-CRP, glucose and creatinine were determined with the automatic ADVIA 1650 analyzer (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). LDL-cholesterol was determined using the Friedewald formula ( Friedewald et al., 1972 ). Plasma total a dip one ct in was determined with an enzyme-linked immu nos or bent assay (Linco Research, St Charles, Mo). Genotyping of whole genome ampli ﬁ ed DNA samples was performed in 2008 with the TaqMan  $\textcircled{8}$   System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), Berlin, Germany. The genotyping success rate was  $99\%$  .  

# 2.3. Statistical analysis  

Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of the SNP was tested using the  $\chi^{2}$    test. Baseline characteristics of the study populations were described as means  $\pm$  standard deviation (SD) for continuous traits, medians and 25th and 75th percentiles for the skewed variables, and  $\%$   for categorical variables. Analysis of covariance considering the additive genetic model was used to assess the association between rs2943634 genotypes (independent variables) and BMI, WC, SBP, DBP, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, TG, blood glucose, HbA1c, hs-CRP, creatinine, and a dip one ct in (dependent variables). P for trend was calculated with a linear regression model. Data is reported as means and standard error (SEM), except for TG, hs-CRP, creatinine, and a dip one ct in which were used log-transformed in order to normalize their distributions, and data is reported as geometric means and  $95\%$   CI. Also to better reach normality of their distributions, glucose was used square root transformed and HbA1c inverse transformed, data for them is respectively reported as squared and inverse means and   $95\%$   CI. Normality of variables was tested by estimating their skewness and kurtosis, by comparing their means and median values and by plotting their distribution in histograms. Association analysis between rs2943634 and fasting depending variables were performed only in participants who were fasting at the time of blood drawing. Association between a dip one ct in and HDL-cholesterol in the subcohort was examined by means of Spearman partial correlation coef ﬁ cient.  

Association of the SNP with risk of MI, IS and CVD, was calculated as hazard ratios (HR) with  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence interval   $(95\%\,\mathsf{C I})$   using Cox proportional-hazard regression, modi ﬁ ed according to the Prentice method ( Prentice and Self, 1988 ) to account for the case – cohort design, using a robust estimator for CI and considering the additive and co-dominant genetic models. Age was the underlying time variable in the counting processes, with entry de ﬁ ned as the individuals' age at the time of recruitment and exit de ﬁ ned as age at the diagnosis of CVD, or censoring.  

Statistical models were adjusted for sex and age (model 1). The second model further included the signi ﬁ cantly associated intermediate traits HDL cholesterol and a dip one ct in. The third model additionally included known cardiovascular risk factors: smoking status (never smoker, former smoker, current smoker  $\cdot{<}20$   cigarettes per day, current smoker  $\cdot\!\geq\!20$   cigarettes per day), sports activity   $(<\!2\,\mathrm{h}/$  wk versus  ${\geq}2\,\mathrm{h}/\mathrm{wk}.$  ), educational attainment (vocational school or less, technical school, university), BMI (continuous), WC (continuous), alcohol consumption (men:  $\scriptstyle=0\,g/d$  ,   ${>}0$   to  $12{\mathrm{~g}}/{\mathsf{d}},\,{>}12$   to   $24\,\mathrm{g/\Omega}$  d;   ${>}24\,\mathrm{g/d}$  ; women:  $\scriptstyle{=0\,\mathrm{g/d}}$  ,  ${>}0$   to   $6\,\mathrm{g}/\mathsf{d}$  ,  ${>}6$   to   $12\,\mathrm{g/d}$  ;  ${>}12\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{d}.$  ), HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, anti hypertensive medication, total cholesterol and hs-CRP. Effect modi ﬁ cation by sex was evaluated by modeling the product term   $S e X\times$  genotype along with main effects

 (in the age-adjusted linear regression analysis).  

All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS Version 9.2

 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The detectable odds ratio of the SNP with CVD, MI and IS was calculated with Quanto ( Gauderman and Morrison, 2006 ) concerning a log-additive model, a desirable power  ${>}80\%$  ,  $\upalpha\!=\!0.05$  , a minor allele frequency of   $36\%$   and a baseline overall disease prevalence in the EPIC-Potsdam population of   $3.1\%$   for CVD  $\mathrm{{'n}\!=\!847}$  ),   $2.0\%$   for MI   $\mathrm{{'n}}\!=\!544$  ) and  $1.1\%$   for IS   $\mathrm{n}\!=\!303$  ). Our esti- mates suggested that the detectable odds ratio was 1.26 for CVD, 1.34 for MI and 1.41 for IS when considering a possible harmful effect of the SNP, and 0.79, 0.75 and 0.71 respectively when considering a possible protective effect.

Demographic, biochemical, clinical and lifestyle characteristics of the subcohort and incident IS and MI cases are given in  Table 1 . The

MI indicates myocardial infarction, IS indicates ischemic stroke. a  Due to missing fasting data, LDL-cholesterol, TG and glucose are based on 543 subcohort individuals, 68 MI cases, and 55 IS cases. b  Median (25th percentile; 75th percentile), all such values.  

genotype frequency of rs2943634 in the subcohort followed HWE  $\mathrm{{'P}}\!=\!0.80!$  ). The A allele (ancestral allele) frequency across the subcohort was   $36\%$  , in accordance with other European populations ( Karvanen et al., 2009; Samani et al., 2007 ). No signi ﬁ cant effect mod- i ﬁ cations by sex were found for the SNP on CVD, MI or IS and the studied intermediate risk phenotypes except for glucose (  $\mathrm{{P}}\!=\!0.03,$  ), for which we therefore present results further adjusted for the interaction term.  

3.2. Association between rs2943634 and intermediate risk phenotypes of cardiovascular diseases  

Table 2  shows results for age and sex adjusted association analysis between rs2943634 and intermediate risk phenotypes of CVD in the subcohort. No signi ﬁ cant associations were found when considering BMI, WC, SBP, DBP, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, glucose, HbA1c, hs-CRP or TG. However, the rs2943634 A allele, was associated with increased HDL-cholesterol and a dip one ct in, and very modestly decreased creatinine. Exclusion of participants taking lipid or anti hypertensive medication did not modify these results (data not shown). Further (mutual) adjustment for lifestyle, biochemical and socio-demographic al variables did not modify these results. However, further adjustment of the association analysis between rs2943634 and HDL-cholesterol for a dip one ct in, abolished the association, and further adjustment of the association analysis between the rs2943634 and a dip one ct in for HDL-cholesterol, slightly attenuated the association ( Table 2 ). A dip one ct in and HDLcholesterol were positively correlated (Spearman correlation coef ﬁ - cient for the age and sex adjusted model: 0.44;  $\mathrm{P}\!<\!0.0001$  ). Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 show results for age and sex adjusted association analysis between rs2943634 and intermediate risk phenotypes of CVD in the subcohort according respectively to the dominant and recessive heritage models.  

3.3. Association between rs2943634 and CVD, MI and IS  

Disease risk was evaluated in 355 CVD, 211 MI and 144 IS incident cases, and 1850 persons who remained free of cardiovascular events during follow-up.  Table 3  shows HR and   $95\%$   CI, for the association analysis based in the co-dominant and additive models between rs2943634 and CVD, MI and IS, adjusted for age and sex (model 1). No signi ﬁ cant associations were found between the SNP and CVD or MI regardless of the adjusting model used. However rs2943634 minor allele A, presented lower risk of IS in an allele dosage fashion. Further adjustment for the intermediate risk phenotypes signi ﬁ cantly associated with the SNP, HDL-cholesterol and a dip one ct in (model 2), did not affect this association. Further adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors (model 3) also did not modify the results. Supplementary Table 3 shows HR and  $95\%$   CI for the associations between rs2943634 polymorphism and cardiovascular endpoints according to the dominant and recessive heritage models.

# 4. Discussion  

In this study we found a novel association between rs2943634 minor allele (A) and decreased risk of IS. Interestingly, this allele was also associated with slightly higher HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin. HDL-cholesterol has been associated with lower IS risk ( Wan name the e et al., 2000 ), and although in the scarce prospective studies available ( Khalili et al., 2010; Matsumoto et al., 2008; Rajpathak et al., 2011; Soderberg et al., 2004; Stott et al., 2009 ) adipo- nectin has been reported not to be associated with stroke risk, it has been proposed to be a marker of conditions that prompt to cardiovascular diseases ( Matsumoto et al., 2008 ). However, adjustment for these biomarkers, did not attenuate the association between rs2943634 and IS, remaining still to be elucidated the biological mechanism underlying this association. A dip one ct in is an adipocytederived hormone suggested to exert anti a the rogen ic, antiin ﬂ ammatory, insulin-sensitizing and car dio protective effects ( Brochu-Gaudreau et al., 2010 ). It is thought to regulate the synthesis of HDL-cholesterol by means of the up regulation of Apo lipoprotein AI (apoA-I) synthesis and secretion ( Matsuura et al., 2007 ), and by the enhancement of the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) mRNA and protein levels ( Oku et al., 2007 ). A dip one ct in has also been suggested to have a role in the regulation of HDLcholesterol catabolism and remodelling mediated by cho lester yl ester transfer protein (CETP) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) ( Cnop et al., 2003; van Hoek et al., 2009 ), and it has been shown to correlate negatively with the fractional catabolic rate of ApoA-I ( Verges et al., 2006 ). Several epidemiological studies have shown a dip one ct in to

CVD, cardiovascular diseases; MI, myocardial infarction; IS, ischemic stroke. a  Model 1: Derived from Cox proportional-hazards regression, with age as underlying time variable, strati ﬁ ed by age at baseline, and adjusted for sex. b  Model 2: Adjusted for model 1, and further for HDL-cholesterol (continuous), and a dip one ct in (continuous). c  Model 3: Adjusted for model 2 and further for smoking status (never smoker, former smoker, current smoker  $<\!20$   cigarettes per day, current smoker  $\backsimeq\!20$   cigarettes per day), sports activity   $(<\!2\:\mathrm{h}/$  /wk versus  ${\geq}2\,\mathrm{h}/\mathrm{wk},$  ), educational attainment (vocational school or less, technical school, university), BMI (continuous), WC (continuous), alcohol consumption (men:  $\scriptstyle=0\,g/d$  ,  ${>}0$   to   $12\,\mathrm{g/d}$  ,  ${>}12$   to  $24\,\mathrm{g/d}$  ;  ${>}24\,\mathrm{g/d}$  ; women:  ${=}0\,\mathrm{g/d},\mathrm{>}0$   to  $6\,\mathrm{g/d}$  ,  ${>}6$   to   $12\,\mathrm{g/d}$  ;  ${>}12\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{d}.$  ), Hba1c (continuous), SBP (continuous), anti hypertensive medication, total cholesterol (continuous) and hs-CRP (continuous).  

be positively correlated with HDL-cholesterol ( Altinova et al., 2007; Schulze et al., 2004; Verges et al., 2006; Zietz et al., 2003 ). In accor- dance to this, a dip one ct in and HDL-cholesterol were positively correlated in our study, and when we adjusted the association analysis of rs2943634 with HDL-cholesterol for a dip one ct in, the association was abolished, suggesting that the SNP might be related to HDLcholesterol by means of a dip one ct in. Besides the role of a dip one ct in on HDL-cholesterol regulation, it has recently been suggested that HDL-cholesterol exerts reciprocal effects on a dip one ct in expression and adipocyte metabolism ( Van Linthout et al., 2010 ). Thus, HDLcholesterol has been seen to increase plasma a dip one ct in concentrations and enhance a dip one ct in expression in adipocytes in a ph os phat idyl in osi to l-3-kinase (PI3K) dependent manner ( Van Linthout et al., 2010 ). In agreement with this observation, when we adjusted rs2943634 association analysis with a dip one ct in for HDLcholesterol, the association was slightly attenuated.  

Since MI and IS share common risk factors, it is surprising that we found a strong association of the SNP with risk of IS, but not with risk of MI. However, several genetic polymorphisms ( Lemaitre et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2011; M et al., 2009; Sie et al., 2006; Siegerink et al., 2009 ) and also established risk factors for both endpoints, including hypertension or smoking ( Heidemann et al., 2007; Weikert et al., 2007 ), also have shown to differ in their importance for the development of MI and IS. In line with our results for MI, no replication studies have been able to con ﬁ rm the association between rs2943634 and CAD ( Bressler et al., 2010; Ghazouani et al., 2010; Karvanen et al., 2009; Muendlein et al., 2009; Samani et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011 ) after it was  ﬁ rst suggested by the WTCCC study and replicated in the German MI family study ( Samani et al., 2007 ). Thus, not the three case – control replication studies with European ( Samani et al., 2009 ), Tunisian ( Ghazouani et al., 2010 ) and Caucasian from the Cleveland GeneBank ( Wang et al., 2011 ) populations, or a biracial, prospective cohort study of US persons ( Bressler et al., 2010 ) reported signi ﬁ cant results. Further, a case – cohort study on the effect of rs2943634 on incident CHD and stroke, based on  ﬁ ve cohorts within the MORGAM project (from Finland, Sweden, France and Northern Ireland), and including a subcohort of 2341 participants, 1436 incident CHD cases and 571 incident stroke cases, also found no signi ﬁ cant associations with cardiovascular endpoints ( Karvanen et al., 2009 ). This study is in addition the only previous to investigate the effect of the SNP on incident stroke, and its results are inconsistent with ours for this outcome ( Karvanen et al., 2009 ). Unfortunately, authors do not provide separate risk estimates for the  ﬁ ve European cohorts, thus although adjusted for the different cohorts, we cannot exclude that results might be driven by the two Finish cohorts, since they represent  $80\%$   of the study population. Also in contrast with our study,  $88\%$   of the participants were men, nearly half of them belonged to cohort of smokers ( Group, 1994 ), and the average age was 60.5 years. In our study, participants are of German origin, only   $37\%$   are men, the average age is 10 years younger, and only  $21\%$   are current smokers. Perhaps these differences may have played a role in the inconsistent results.  

rs2943634 was not associated with BMI, WC, SBP, DBP, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, glucose, HbA1c and hs-CRP in our study population. Concerning the associations between rs2943634 and these intermediate risk phenotypes, results across studies are also inconsistent. Thus, rs2943634 has been reported to be associated with BMI, LDL-cholesterol ( Samani et al., 2007 ) and blood pressure ( Karvanen et al., 2009; Samani et al., 2007 ), and not associated with HDL-cholesterol ( Cunnington et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011 ), however, and in line with our results, rs2943634 minor allele (A) has also been reported not to be associated with blood pressure, BMI, WC, cholesterol, hs-CRP ( Cunnington et al., 2009 ), LDLcholesterol and TG ( Cunnington et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011 ), and to be associated with higher HDL-cholesterol (  $\cdot1.05\,\mathrm{mg/d l}$   increase per allele) ( Karvanen et al., 2009 ). We are the  ﬁ rst to report association analysis results between rs2943634 and a dip one ct in, glucose, HbA1c and creatinine.  

Strengths and limitations of our study should be mentioned. The prospective design may include other cases than case – control studies and thereby come up with new insights into the relationship between genetic information and disease risk. The risk factors were assessed at baseline only, therefore, we assumed that these variables remained stable over time; fasting data was available only for about one third of the population, thus, association analysis for TG, LDL-cholesterol and glucose was performed in this reduced sample. Our study sample consisted of a modest number of incident MI cases (  $\mathrm{{\dot{n}}}\!=\!211$  ), however, given that the estimated HR for MI were close to 1.0 regardless of the adjusting model used or the heritage model considered, we believe that the lack of association of the SNP with MI in our population was not derived from insuf ﬁ cient statistical power. Nevertheless, all the positive  ﬁ ndings of our study should be replicated in an independent cohort. Finally, all the reported signi ﬁ cance levels were nominal P values and were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, however after stringent Bonferroni correction for the testing of multiple hypotheses (P corrected  $_{<0.003}$  ) results for IS, a dip one ct in and HDLcholesterol remained signi ﬁ cant.  

# 5. Conclusions  

In this European population the minor allele of the rs2943634 SNP was associated with lower risk of IS, but not by means of the risk factors investigated in this study. rs2943634 was also related to plasma levels of a dip one ct in and HDL-cholesterol. However, considering the inconsistent results across studies and the relatively modest sample size of our study, these  ﬁ ndings need to be replicated in further investigations.
