Objective :  The extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell adhesion molecules play crucial roles in ang io genesis, apoptosis, thrombosis, and inflammation,  and also contribute to the pathogen es is of stroke. Integrin, alpha 6 (ITGA6) is a member of ECM adhesion receptors. We investigated whether two  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs11895564, Ala380Thr; rs2293649, Asp694Asp) of ITGA6 were associated with the development and  clinical phenotypes of intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and ischemic stroke (IS).  

Methods :  We enrolled 199 stroke (78 ICH and 121 IS) and 291 control subjects. Stroke patients were divided into subgroups according to the  scores of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Survey (NIHSS,  ${<}6$   and  ${\tt V}$  ) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI,  ${<\!60}$   and  ${\ge}0$  ). SNPStats, SNPAnalyz­ er, and Helixtree programs were used to calculate odds ratios,   $95\%$   confidence intervals, and   $p$   values. Multiple logistic regression models were  used to analyze genetic data.  

Results :  A missense SNP rs11895564 was associated with the development of ICH  $(p{=}0.026$   $\rho{=}0.013$   in recessive,   $p{=}0.02$   in  log-additive models;  $\rho{=}0.041$   in allele distributions). The A allele frequency of rs11895564 was higher in the ICH group   $(13.5\%)$   than in the control  group  $(8.1\%)$  . In the clinical phenotypes, rs11895564 and rs2293649 showed significant associations in the MBI scores of IS (  $/\rho{=}0.014$   in codomi­ nant1 model;   $p{=}0.02$   in allele distributions) and NIHSS scores of ICH   $(p{=}0.017$   in co dominant 2,   $\rho{=}0.035$   in recessive,   $\rho{=}0.035$   in log-additive  models), respectively.  

Conclusion :  These results suggest that ITGA6 may be associated with the development and clinical phenotypes of stroke in Korean population.

# INTRODUCTION  

Several lines of evidences support that genetic factors contrib­ ute to the risk of stroke . In very recent, numerous genetic  studies have been reported the relationship between stroke and  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of candidate genes such  as methylene tetra hydro folate reductase [NAD(P)H] (MTH­ FR) 20) , tumor protein p53 (TP53) 5) , transforming growth factor,  beta 1 (TGFB1) 21) , gap junction protein, alpha 4, 37kDa (GJA4,  also known as connexin 37) 11) , interleukin 10 (IL10) 18) , chemo­ kine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2, also known as MCP1) 1) .  

The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in organ and  tissue morphogenesis and in the maintenance of cell and tissue  structure. ECM interacts with cell adhesion molecules (CAMs),  mainly integrins and also proteoglycans, glycoproteins or im­ mu no globulin superfamily. These interactions lead to a wide  array of ph y sio logic and pathologic processes such as cell adhe­ sion, cell proliferation, ang io genesis, apoptosis, thrombosis, and  inflammation. CAMs are also important for the development of  neuronal tissue. During the developmental period of the nervous  system, synapses develop through formation of cell-cell adhe­ sions. Furthermore cell-cell adhesions serve a crucial role in the  brain morphology and functions such as memory and learning.  Integrins are trans membrane proteins consisted of an alpha  subunit and a beta subunit. Integrin, alpha 6 (ITGA6) interacts  beta subunits and then makes integrin he ter odi mers,   $\upalpha6\upbeta1$   and   $\mathsf{a684^{15,17}}$  . ITGA1, ITGA6, and ITGB1 are distributed in cere­ bral micro vas cula ture 7) . It is known that integrins are involved  in cerebral micro vascular signaling during focal ischemia/per­ fusion. Wagner et al.  found that the expression of ITGA6 in  ischemic basal ganglia was significantly and abruptly decreased  

cSNPs with he ter oz y gos it y below 0.1 or unknown he ter oz y gos it y  and minor allele frequency (MAF) below 0.1 or unknown MAF  were excluded. Out of 12 missense SNPs, SNPs with he ter oz y gos­ ity below 0.1 or unknown he ter oz y gos it y were 9 and SNPs with  unknown MAF were 2. Among 10 synonymous SNPs, there  were 7 SNPs with he ter oz y gos it y below 0.1 or unknown hetero­ zygosity, 1 SNPs with unknown MAF, and 1 SNP with MAF  0.1065. Finally, one missense SNP (rs11895564, Ala380Thr) and  one synonymous SNP (rs2293649, Asp694Asp) were selected.  

by 24-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion, compared with  non-ischemic zone. Although integrins may be related to stroke  susceptibility, the genetic determinants are not fully defined.  

In this study, we investigated the association between ITGA6  SNPs and stroke [ischemic stroke (IS) and intra cerebral hemor­ rnage (ICH)], and their clinical phenotypes in Korean population.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Study population and clinical phenotypes  

All participants were enrolled among subjects visiting at the  departments of neurosurgery and emergency medicine in our  hospital. Control subjects   $\mathrm{(n{=}291}$  , 152 males/139 females) were  recruited among healthy volunteers to examine the general health  check-up program (Table 1). Subjects with neurological diseas­ es, ischemic heart diseases, and other severe diseases were ex­ cluded. A total of 199 stroke patients comprised 78 ICH patients 

 (46 males/32 females) and 121 IS patients (68 males/53 females) 

 (Table 1). Subjects with transient ischemic attack, cerebro vas cu­ lar malformation, brain tumors, congenital brain disorders, and  traumatic or iatrogenic stroke were excluded. Stroke patients  were diagnosed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance  imaging, and angiography. All stroke patients were classified  into the clinical phenotypes according to the National Institutes  of Health Stroke Survey (NIHSS) score and the Modified Barth­ el Index (MBI) score. For the neurological functional level of pa­ tient, the severity of 13 neurologic symptoms was evaluated by  the NIHSS. For the activity of daily living (ADL) of patients, the  quality of 10 general life activities was estimated by the MBI.  Subjects with inappropriate data were excluded. Protocol in this  study was approved by the ethics review committee of Medical  Research Institute at our hospital. Written informed consent  was obtained from each subject. If stroke patients were incom­ municative, it was obtained from close relatives or guardian.  

# SNP genotyping  

Peripheral blood samples were collected from all subjects,  and genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted using  QIAamp® DNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Gen­ otypes of the two selected SNPs were determined by direct se­ quencing (MACROGEN, Seoul, Korea). Polymerase chain re­ actions (PCRs) were performed with the following primers  $:$  for  rs11895564 (sense,   $5^{\circ}$  -G GAG CCC CACA GT AT TTT GATA $\cdot3^{\circ}$  ;  antisense,   $5^{\circ}$  -TAG TTT CT CCC AT GT TG GTC A GG $\cdot3^{\circ}$  ; product  size,   $348~\mathrm{top}$  ) and for rs2293649 (sense,   $5^{\circ}$  -GG AAA CGT AT T  GAG GAC TTT GC $_3\mathrm{{}^{\circ}}$  ; antisense,   $5^{\circ}$  -GT TG GC A A CACA ACT  CAACTGT-3’; product size,   $363{\mathrm{~bp}}$  ). PCR consisted of 40 cy­ cles at   $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 sec,   $58^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 sec,   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30 sec, and 1  cycle at   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $5\;\mathrm{min}$   to extend the reaction. The PCR prod­ ucts were sequenced by an ABI PRISM   $3730\mathrm{XL}$   analyzer (PE  Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and sequencing  data were analyzed using SeqManII software (DNASTAR,  Madison, WI, USA).  

# Statistic analysis  

SNP Analyzer Pro (ISTECH, Goyang, Korea), Helixtree  (Golden Helix, Bozeman, MT, USA), and SNPStats (http://bio­ info.icon co logia.net/index.php?module  $:=$  Snpstats) were per­ formed to obtain ORs,   $95\%$   CIs, and  $\it{\Delta}p$   values adjusting age and  sex as co variables. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was  evaluated by the chi-squared test. Multiple logistic regression  models (co dominant 1, co dominant 2, dominant, recessive, and  log-additive) were used to analyze genetic data. In case of the  numbers below   $5,p$   value was corrected by the Fisher’s exact test.  

# SNP selection  

We searched the coding SNPs (cSNPs) of the ITGA6 gene in  the SNP database of the National Center for Biotechnology In­ formation (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP, BUILD 132). The  

Haploview version 4.2 (Daly Lab, Cam­ bridge, MA, USA) was also used to de­ termine the linkage d is equilibrium (LD)  block and haplotypes between two SNPs.  The statistical significance level was set  at  $p{<}0.05$  .

# RESULTS  

# Clinical characteristics of stroke  and control subjects  

The clinical features of patients with  stroke and control subjects are present­ ed in Table 1. The age of ICH, IS, and  control subjects (mean  $\pm\mathrm{SD}_{i}$  , years) was   $56.4{\pm}12.5,$  ,   $65.7{\pm}12.1;$  , and   $63.0{\pm}9.3\$   years, respectively. Because the mean age of each group  was different   $\scriptstyle(p<0.05)$  , age and sex as covariates were adjusted  to obtain statistical results in the analysis of genetic data. Stroke  patients were divided into two clinical phenotypes in accordance  to NIHSS (scores of 13 neurological symptoms;  ${<}6$   and  ${\ge}6$  ) and  MBI (scores of 10 activities of general life;   ${<\!60}$   and   ${\ge}60$  ). The  number of ICH patients with NIHSS scores   ${<}6$  and   ${\ge}6$   was 24  and 50, respectively. The number of ICH patients with MBI scores   ${<\!60}$   and  ${\ge}60$   was 54 and 14, respectively. Out of IS patients, 56  and 57 subjects displayed NIHSS scores of   ${<}6$   and   ${\geq}6,$   respec­ tively, and 71 and 25 subjects displayed MBI scores of   ${<\!60}$   and   ${\ge}60$  , respectively (Table 1).  

# Genetic analysis  

Multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and  sex was performed using the following models  $:$  co dominant 1  (major allele homozygotes vs. heterozygotes), co dominant 2 (ma­ jor allele homozygotes vs. minor allele homozygotes), dominant  (major allele homozygotes vs. heterozygotes+minor allele homo­ zygotes), recessive (major allele homozygotes+heterozygotes vs.  minor allele homozygotes) and log-additive (major allele ho­ mozygotes vs. heterozygotes vs. minor allele homozygotes).  

The genotype and allele frequencies of the two selected SNPs  are presented in Table 2, 3, 4. Two cSNPs (rs11895564, Al­ a380Thr; rs2293649, Asp694Asp) were in HWE in the ICH, IS,  and control groups, respectively (  $\scriptstyle{p>0.05}$  , data not shown). As  shown in Table 2, a missense SNP (rs11895564, Ala380Thr) of  the ITGA6 gene was associated with the development of ICH  (  $\acute{p}{=}0.026$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}16.56$  ,  $95\%$   CI=1.58-173.86 in codominant2 mod­ el;  $\scriptstyle{\mathit{p}}=0.013$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}{=}15.21$  ,  $95\%$   CI=1.46-158.80 in recessive model;  

$p{=}0.020$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.00$  ,   $95\%$   CI  $\c=$  1.13-3.57 in log-additive model).  The A allele frequency of rs11895564 was higher in the ICH  group than in the control group (  $13.5\%$   vs.   $8.1\%$  ;   $p{=}0.041$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}1.77$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.02{-}3.06$  ). The rs2293649 SNP was not as­ sociated with the development of ICH (Table 2). Genotype and  allele frequencies of rs11895564 and rs2293649 were no differ­ ent between IS and controls (Table 3). These results indicate  that the rs11895564 SNP of the ITGA6 gene may be associated  with ICH, but not IS, and the A allele of rs11895564 could be a  risk factor for the development of ICH.  

# Analysis of clinical phenotypes  

All stroke patients were classified into clinical phenotypes ac­ cording to the NIHSS score (  $\mathord{\langle}<\!6$  or   ${\ge}6$  ) and the MBI score (  $\mathord{\zeta}{<}60$    or  ${\ge}60$  ). In Table 4, the rs2293649 SNP was associated with the  NIHSS scores of ICH (  $\scriptstyle{\mathit{p}}=0.017$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}6.04,$  ,   $95\%$  CI=1.06-34.46  in codominant model2;  $p{=}0.035$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}4.61$  ,   $95\%$   CI=0.92-22.94  in recessive model;  $\scriptstyle{\mathit{p}}=0.035$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}{=}2.22$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.03{-}4.86$  0 in  log-additive model). The  $\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{G}$   genotype frequency of rs2293649  was higher in the   $\mathrm{{\chiHSS}}\ge6$   group   $(30.0\%)$   than in the NIHSS   ${<}6$   group   $(8.3\%)$  ). The 11895564 SNP was not related to the NI­ HSS scores of ICH. The results suggest that ITGA6 rs2293649  may contribute to the neurological function levels of ICH. In Ta­ ble 5, the rs11895564 SNP had significant associations between  IS patients with MBI   ${<\!60}$   and IS patients MBI   ${\ge}60$  (  $\scriptstyle{\phi=0.014,}$   

  $\mathrm{OR}{=}3.88$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.32$  -11.35 in co dominant 1 model;  $p{=}0.020$  , 

  $\mathrm{OR}{=}3.24$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}{=}1.21{-}8.71$   in allele distributions). The A al­ lele frequency of rs11895564 in the MBI   ${\ge}60$   group   $(18.0\%)$    was about 2.8-fold higher, compared to the MBI   ${<\!60}$   group   $(6.3\%)$  ). The rs2293649 SNP was not associated with the MBI  scores of IS. These data suggest that ITGA6 rs11895564 may be

involved in the ADL of IS. However, rs2293649 was not contrib­ uted to the MBI scores of IS (Table 5). In addition, rs11895564  showed borderline significance s in the NIHSS scores of IS   $(p{=}0.057$   in co dominant 1 model;  $p{=}0.070$   in allele distribu­ tions) (data not shown).  

# Linkage d is equilibrium and haplotypes  

Haploview version 4.2 was used to evaluate the LD block and  haplotypes between rs11895564 and rs2293649 in the coding  region of the ITGA6 gene. The LD block between two SNPs in  the control groups was not made (  $\mathrm{{CD}^{\circ}{=}0.29}$   and   $\mathrm{r}^{2}{=}0.009$  ).  Therefore, we did not analyze the haplotypes.

interactions such as ex ci to toxicity, a cido toxicity, ionic imbal­ ance, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis 4) . Milner et  al.  found that focal cerebral ischemia induced loss of ITGA1  and ITGA6, and oxygen-glucose deprivation produced a signif­ icant decreasing both ITGA1 and ITGA6 by murine astrocytes.  The integrin  $\upalpha_{6}\upbeta_{4}$   and ITGB4 were identified between the myo­ intima and the astrocyte compartments in cerebral micro vessels.  Middle cerebral artery occlusion produced a significant reduc­ tion of the   $\upalpha_{6}\upbeta_{4}$   at the astrocyte-matrix interface in micro vessels,  suggesting that the expression of   $\upalpha_{6}\upbeta_{4}$   is extraordinarily sensi­ tive to ischemia 22) . Variants in ITGA2 have been reported to be  associated with an increased risk for ischemic stroke . Our  data revealed that a missense SNP rs11895564 (Ala380Thr) of  ITGA6 was associated with the development of ICH, but not IS  (Table 2, 3). Although we cannot exactly explain this discrepan­ cy, it seems to be different mechanisms for the etiology of ICH or  IS might be involved. However, the biological roles of rs11895564  on stroke development will be need in future. Loughlin et al.   reported that micro satellite of ITGA6 was associated with hip  osteoarthritis in female. Johnatty et al.  showed the association  between ITGA6 rs13027811 intron SNP (iSNP) and ovarian  cancer. The rs12621278 iSNP of ITGA6 was associated with the  progression of prostate cancer 2) . We found that the synonymous  SNP rs2293649 (Asp694Asp) of ITGA6 was associated with the  NIHSS scores of ICH (Table 4), suggesting rs2293649 may be  contribute to the neurological functional levels of ICH. We also  found that the missense SNP rs11895564 was associated with  the MBI scores of IS (Table 5), suggesting rs11895564 may be  contribute to the ADL of IS. Based on previous and present stud­ ies, we speculate that ITGA6 may be involved in the develop­ ment and clinical characteristics of stroke.  

ITGA6 protein (UniProt ID, P23229) consists of 1,130 amino  acids (AAs) with the signal peptide the signal peptide (from 1 to  23 AAs), integrin alpha-6 heavy chain (from 24 to 938 AAs), and  integrin alpha-6 light chain (from 942 to 1,130 AAs). ITGA6 also  composed of several regions  $:$  the extracellular topological do­ main, from 24 to 1,050 AAs; helical trans membrane, from 1,051  to 1,076 AAs; cytoplasmic topological domain, from 1,077 to  1,130 AAs; interaction with HPS5, from 1,077 to 1,083 AAs;  GFFKR motif, from 1,079 to 1,083 AAs) (http://www.uniprot.org/ uniprot). Two SNPs (rs11895564, Ala380Thr; rs2293649, As­ p694Asp) are located at both the integrin alpha-6 heavy chain  and extracellular topological domain. In the SNP database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP, BUILD 132), the G and A  allele frequencies in the rs11895564 SNP have been reported to  be 0.704 and 0.296 in European, 0.624 and 0.376 in Sub-Saha­ ran African, 0.878 and 0.122 in Japanese, and 0.884 and 0.116  in Chinese, respectively. In our control group, the G and A al­ lele frequencies were 0.919 and 0.081, which are similar to  those seen in Asian populations (Table 2). The G and A allele  frequencies in the rs2293649 SNP have been reported to be 0.819  and 0.181 in European, 0.841 and 0.159 in Sub-Saharan African,  0.395 and 0.605 in Japanese, and 0.453 and 0.547 in Chinese, re­ spectively. In our control group, the G and A allele frequencies  were 0.443 and 0.557, which are similar to those seen in Chinese  population (Table 2). There is ethnic difference in the allele dis­ tributions of rs2293649. The incidence of ICH is higher in  Asians than in other populations.  

To our knowledge, this is the first study that whether ITGA6  SNPs are associated with the development and clinical phenotypes  of stroke. Our results revealed that a missense SNP rs11895564 was  associated with the development of ICH   $\acute{p}{=}0.026$   in codomi­ nant2,   $p{=}0.013$   in recessive,   $p{=}0.02$   in log-additive models;   $\scriptstyle{\mathit{p}}=0.041$   in allele distributions) and the MBI scores of IS (  $(p{=}0.014$    in co dominant 1 model;   $p{=}0.02$   in allele distributions). The A  allele frequency of rs11895564 in the ICH group was about 2.8- fold   $(13.5\%)$  , compared to that in the control group   $(8.1\%)$  ). More­ over, the A/A genotype frequency of rs11895564 was much dif­ ferent between ICH patients and control subjects (  $3.8\%$   vs.  $0.3\%$  ).  These data strongly suggest that the A allele of rs11895564 may  be a risk factor for the development of ICH. The synonymous  SNP rs2293649 was significantly difference between ICH pa­ tients with NIHSS   ${<}6$   and ICH patients with NIHSS  ${\ge}6$     $(p{=}0.017$    in co dominant 2,  $p{=}0.035$   in recessive,   $\scriptstyle{\mathit{p}}=0.035$   in log-additive  models). Present study has limitations to make our conclusion  clear. Because we evaluated small cases, additional studies with  larger number of cases or other populations should be conduct­ ed in the future.  

# CONCLUSION  

In conclusion, we report that ITGA6 may be associated with  the development and clinical characteristics of stroke in Korean  population.
