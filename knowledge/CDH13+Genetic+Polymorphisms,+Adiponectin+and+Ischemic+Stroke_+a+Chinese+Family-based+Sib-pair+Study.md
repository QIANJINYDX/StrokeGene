# Abstract  

Objective   To understand the relationships between  CDH13  (T-cadherin) genetic polymorphisms,  a dip one ct in levels and ischemic stroke, and possible interactions between  CDH13  polymorphisms and  other risk factors.  

Methods   We recruited 342 Chinese ischemic stroke sib pairs. We genotyped rs4783244 and  rs7193788 on  CDH13  using time-of-flight mass spectrometry genotyping technology and measured total  and high-molecular weight (HMW) a dip one ct in levels. We investigated associations between SNPs and  ischemic stroke, and interactions between SNPs and other risk factors using multi-level mixed-effects  regression model.  

Results   In individuals without ischemic stroke,  CDH13  rs4783244 was associated with total  a dip one ct in levels (per T: Coef   $=\;-0.257$  ,   $P\,=\,0.001)$  ).  CDH13  rs7193788 was associated with total  a dip one ct in levels (per A: Coef  $=-0.221$  ,   $P=0.001$  ) and HMW a dip one ct in levels (per A: Coef   $=-0.163$  ,    $P=0.003,$  ). rs7193788 was significantly associated with ischemic stroke (GA/AA  vs.  GG:   $O R=1.55$  ,   $95\%$    CI : 1.07 to 2.24,  $P=0.0203$  ) after Bonferroni correction   $({\tt a}=0.025)$  ). There was an interaction between  rs7193788 and diabetes   $\left(P\ =\ 0.036\right)$  ). Compared to diabetes-free individuals with rs7193788 GG  genotype, diabetes patients with rs7193788 GA/AA genotypes had higher risks for ischemic stroke (  $O R=$    2.64,   $95\%$    CI : 1.58-4.40,  $P<0.001$  ).  

Conclusion    CDH13  genetic polymorphisms are associated with a dip one ct in levels and ischemic stroke.  An interaction is found between  CDH13  SNP and diabetes for ischemic stroke.

# INTRODUCTION  

S  troke is the leading cause of disability and  mortality worldwide . Stroke burden  continues  to  increase,  especially  in  developing countries . Incidence rate of ischemic  stroke (IS) is high in China . It is valuable to evaluate  genetic and environmental risk factors for IS in  Chinese population.  

Low serum a dip one ct in level is a predisposing  factor for type 2 diabetes, hypertension and  cardiovascular diseases . Laboratory evidences  suggest  that  the  anti-inflammatory  and  anti-a the rogen ic properties of a dip one ct in can protect  vascular system . These favorable effects attributed  to a dip one ct in intrigue people to investigate whether  it can also lower the risk of ischemic stroke. However,  the direct association between a dip one ct in and  development of IS remains to be inconsistent . This  might due to possible confounding effect of  environmental  factors  on  a dip one ct in  levels.  Discussing associations between a dip one ct in related  genetic polymorphisms and IS can avoid this problem.  

Genome-wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  concerning a dip one ct in levels identified some risk  genetic polymorphisms. SNPs on  ADIPOQ ,  ARL15  and  FER  genes were associated with plasma a dip one ct in  levels in European population . GWAS for Asian  populations discovered novel risk loci on other genes,  including rs3865188 on  CDH13  (T-cadherin) gene in  Filipino women  and Korean individuals , and  rs4783244 on  CDH13  gene in Japanese  and  Chinese  populations. rs4783244 was further  proved to be associated with high-molecular weight  (HMW)  a dip one ct in  levels  in  East  Asian  populations .  CDH13  is the encoding gene of  T-cadherin, which is a major a dip one ct in receptor in  vas cula ture . GWAS results suggest that  CDH13   may play an important role on a dip one ct in levels in  Asian populations.  

Previous studies revealed some associations  between a dip one ct in related SNPs and IS. Cheong et al.  found that 6 polymorphisms on  ADIPOQ  were  strongly associated with ischemic stroke . Chung et al.  reported associations between  CDH13  rs4783244,  rs8047711, rs7193788 and ischemic stroke .  However, most genetic epidemiological studies  focusing on the association between  CDH13  and  stroke adopted population-based case-control study  design. Its vulnerability to the problem of population  stratification often undermined the accuracy of  statistical analysis, and thus led to false negative  findings . Sib pair study design compares genetic  polymorphisms between full siblings with same  genetic  backgrounds,  which  counteracts  confounding due to population stratification .  What’s more, the aggregation of risk genetic  material in sib pairs prone to IS might be in favor of  discovering de novo risk loci.  

To understand the relationships between  CDH13 polymorphisms, a dip one ct in levels and IS, this study  discussed: 1) the associations between  CDH13  genetic  polymorphisms and a dip one ct in levels; 2) the  associations between  CDH13  genetic polymorphisms  and IS; 3) the interactions between  CDH13  genetic  polymorphisms and other risk factors for IS.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Subjects  

The current study is a part of Fangshan  Family-based Ischemic Stroke Study In China (FISSIC)  program, which is an ongoing family-based genetic  epidemiological study. The protocol was described in  details elsewhere . In brief, we recruited Northern  Chinese Han pedigrees from Fangshan District, which  is located in the southwest of Beijing, China. The  inclusion criteria for IS patients were: 1) diagnosis of  at least one ischemic stroke confirmed by the study  neurologist on the basis of history, medical records,  and head imaging by CT or MRI; 2) at least 18 years  old by the time of enrolment in the study; 3) at least  one full sibling or parent alive in areas nearby; 4)  written informed consent by the patient or surrogate.  The exclusion criteria for IS patients were: 1)  diagnosis of TIA only; 2) diagnosis of vasospasm after  sub ara ch noid  hemorrhage;  3)  diagnosis  of  Mendelian disorders: CADASIL, Fabry disease, MELAS,  or sickle cell anaemia; 4) diagnosis of iatrogenic  ischemic  stroke  associated  with  a  surgical/  interventional procedure such as coronary artery  bypass grafting, carotid end art erect o my, or heart  valve surgery; 5) diagnosis of ischemic stroke  associated  with  autoimmune  condition  or  endocarditis. The inclusion criteria for IS-free siblings  were: 1) over 18 years old; 2) had no medical history  of IS. The exclusion criteria for IS-free siblings were:  1) uncapable of coor pe rating during physical  examinations; 2) refused to provide blood samples.  

Since June 2005 to June 2013, we recruited 342  discordant IS sib pairs (684 individuals in total) using  proband-initiated  contact  method .  Each  discordant IS sib pair contained one confirmed IS  patient and one IS-free full sibling.  

# Ischemic Stroke Confirmation  

Medical records including patient history,  physical examination, laboratory testing and brain  imaging data of every IS patient were collected from  local hospitals and sent to study neurologists for  stroke confirmation. The IS-free status was identified  using the Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-Free  Status (QVSFS) . Siblings with negative responses  to all 8 questions and with no IS medical history  were defined as IS-free siblings.  

# Assessment of Total and HMW A dip one ct in Levels  

Fasting venous blood samples were collected  from every participant. Blood samples were  transferred into labeled vacuum tubes containing  EDTA, and then they were centrifuged at 4000 rpm  for 15 min to obtain serum.  

Total a dip one ct in and HMW a dip one ct in concen-trations   $({\mathsf{n g}}/{\mathsf{m L}})$   in serum were estimated by commer-cially available ELISA kits (EK0595, Boster, Wuhan,  China; CSB-E13400h, Cusabio, Wuhan, China) using  TECAN GENios Plus enzyme-linked immuno s or bent  assay reader (TECAN, Grödig, Austria).  

# An thro po metric  and  Biochemical  Indices  Determinations  

Surveys were carried out by trained and  qualified staffs. Demographic information was  collected by a standard questionnaire. A current  smoker was a person who had at least 1 cigarette per  day. An ex-smoker was a person who had regularly  smoked but had quitted smoking for at least 1  month. A non-smoker was a person who had never  smoked. The current and ex-smokers were both  treated as smokers during the analysis. A drinker was  a person who had ever had at least 50 milliliter white  spirit per week and lasted for at least 6 months.  Sitting blood pressure was examined for 3 times  using brachial blood pressure meters (HEM-7200,  Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan). The mean of the  second and the third observed values was taken as  one’s final blood pressure. BMI was calculated as  weight/height 2   $(\mathsf{k g}/\mathsf{m}^{2})$  .   ${\sf B M I}~\geq~25$   was defined as  overweight/obesity, while   $\mathsf{B M I}<25$   was defined as  normal. Hypertension was defined as a diagnosis of  hypertension, anti hypertensive therapy,   $\mathsf{S B P\;\geq\;140}$  mmHg or   ${\mathsf{D B P}}\ \geq\ 90\ \mathsf{\ m m H g}$   during examination.  Diabetes was defined as a diagnosis of diabetes,  anti diabetic therapy, or fast blood glucose   $(\mathsf{F B G})\geq$   $7.0\,\mathsf{m m o l}/\mathsf{L}$  

Fasting venous blood samples were tested in  Peking University Health Science Center Key  Laboratory of Epidemiology for fast blood glucose  (FBG, mmol/L), total cholesterol (TC, mmol/L), total  triglycerides (TG, mmol/L), high density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C, mmol/L), and low density  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, mmol/L).  

# Genotyping of SNPs  

A GWAS performed in Chinese Han population  identified  three  quantitative  trait  loci  (QTL)  regulating the a dip one ct in levels, i.e. rs4783244,  rs8047711, and rs7193788 on  CDH13  gene .  Another GWAS in Singaporean Chinese showed  strong associations between  CDH13  rs4783244 and  a dip one ct in levels . The minor allele frequency  (MAF) of rs8047711 is relatively low. Considering the  sample size of the present study, we selected  CDH13   rs4783244 and rs7193788 as candidate SNPs.  

DNA was isolated from peripheral venous blood  leucocytes. DNA genotyping was performed using  time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry  genotyping  technology  with  MassARRAY  iPLEX  platform  (Sequenom Inc, San Diego, California, USA) following  the manufacturer’s protocol. Genotypes were  assessed by MassARRAY® Typer Analyzer version 4.0.  The call rates for 2 SNPs were all above   $99.0\%$  . A  randomly chosen subgroup of   $5\%$   of DNA samples  went  through  repeat  analysis  to  verify  reproducibility. The results of duplicated samples  were  $100\%$   consistent.  

# Ethics Statement  

The study design was explained to every subject  during recruitment. Every participant gave written  informed consent. This project was approved by the  Ethics Committee of Peking University Health  Science Center, Beijing, China.  

# Statistical Analysis  

A dip one ct in levels, HMW a dip one ct in levels and  total triglycerides (TG) were analyzed on natural  logarithmic  scales  because  of  their  skewed  distribution. Continuous variables were described as  mean ± standard deviation and Student   $t\cdot$  -test was  adopted  to  compare  means  across  groups.  Categorical variables were described as frequency  and proportion, and Pearson’s  $\chi^{2}$   test was used for  comparisons between groups.  

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each SNP  was estimated, and no violation was found for any  SNP. HWE  $P_{\cdot}$  -values for all SNPs were shown in Table  3. To avoid reverse causality, we investigated the  associations between 2 SNPs and total and HMW  a dip one ct in levels in IS-free individuals and IS  patients respectively. Because individuals in each  group were unrelated individuals from different  pedigrees, these associations were analyzed using  linear regression model. Considering the shared  genetic backgrounds of full siblings and the  compromised individual independence, we applied  multi-level mixed-effects regression models to  investigate the associations between  CDH13  SNPs  and  $|\mathsf{S}^{[28]}$  . We employed Bonferroni correction due to  multiple testing. SNPs with   $P<0.05/2=0.025$   were  considered significant. We estimated interactions  between two SNPs in  CDH13  and smoking, drinking,  BMI, history of hypertension, history of diabetes for  IS by adding multiplicative terms in multi-level  mixed-effects regression models. Statistical analyses  were performed by STATA (version 13, Stata  Corporation, Texas, USA).  

# RESULTS  

# An thro po metric,  Lifestyle  Characteristics  and  Biochemical Indices of ischemic Stroke Sib-pairs  

A total of 342 Chinese Han discordant IS sib pairs  consisting of 342 confirmed IS patients and 342  IS-free siblings were enrolled in the present study.  The mean age at enrollment for IS patients was   $61.09\pm9.22$  . The mean age at enrollment for IS-free  siblings was  $57.52\pm9.05$  . The mean age at onset for  IS patients was   $55.4\,\pm\,9.09$  . Compared with IS-free  siblings, IS patients were older, had a higher  proportion of male, and had higher rates of diabetes  mellitus and hypertension. IS patients also had  higher smoking rate, as well as higher FBG levels,  higher TG levels and lower HDL-C levels. The total  a dip one ct in levels of IS patients were lower than  IS-free siblings.  

There were no significant differences with  respect to alcohol consumption, BMI, TC, LDL-C, and  HMW a dip one ct in levels between IS patients and  IS-free siblings (Table 1).  

Associations between CDH13 SNPs and A dip one ct in  Levels     In IS-free individuals, rs4783244 T allele  was associated with total a dip one ct in levels (per T  allele: Coef   $=\ -0.257.$  ,   $P~=~0.001)$  ) but not HMW  a dip one ct in levels (per T allele: Coef   $=\,-0.079\,\,P\,=$  0.204). Compared with rs4783244 GG genotype,  GT/TT genotypes were associated with lower total  a dip one ct in levels (GT/TT  vs.  GG: Coef  $=-0.265$  ,  $P=$  0.008).  

In IS-free siblings, rs7193788 A allele was  associated with total a dip one ct in levels (per A allele:   $\mathsf{C o e f}=-0.221$  ,  $P=0.001)$   and HMW a dip one ct in levels

higher risks of IS compared with individuals with GG  genotypes,  which  was  compatible  with  the  hypothesis that  CDH13  genetic polymorphisms can  impact the risk of ischemic stroke through its  influence on a dip one ct in levels.  

Interactions between  CDH13  polymorphisms  and environmental factors were studied before. Jo et  al. observed that the association between  CDH13   and a dip one ct in can be modified by smoking and  obesity. Obese smokers with risk  CDH13  rs3865188  polymorphisms were at 6.2-fold higher risk for  hypo a dip one ct in emi a . Chung et al.   reported an  interaction between  CDH13  rs4783244 and sex for  HOMA-IR/T2DM. However, no interactions were  found between rs4783244 and smoking for T2DM or  stroke . Diabetes impairs endothelium function  and augments the formation of at hero sclerotic  lesions . The presence of diabetes can significantly  increase the risk of stroke . A dip one ct in played a  vascular protective role by preserving endo the li al  cell function . It is of value to discuss the joint  effect of  CDH13  SNPs and diabetes for IS. An  interaction between rs7193788 and diabetes for IS  was found in this study. Individuals with rs7193788  risk genotypes, as well as diabetes, had higher risks  of IS.  

The present study applied a sib pair design. This  design provided resistance to problems associated  with population stratification that can occur in  case-control studies, while the unique family-based  design lowered the possibility of false positive  discoveries . We applied multi-level mixed-effects  regression model to analyze sib pair data, for it can  gain more power than traditional family based  algorithms. Considering the limited sample size,  using multi-level mixed-effects regression model  may increase the possibility of true positive  discoveries.  

However, there were still some limitations. The  main limitation of this study was its sample size. The  small sample size could decrease statistical power.  However,  because  of  the  strict recruitment  requirement of eligible patients and full siblings, sib  pair studies are far more difficult and expensive to  undertake than case control studies . Second,  considering the small sample size, we didn’t analyze  the relationships between SNPs and IS subtypes. The  associations between a dip one ct in and different  etiologic subtypes of IS may be different, for low  a dip one ct in levels were found to be significantly  associated with increased risk of large artery  atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke but not non-LAA  stroke . Third, given the cross-sectional nature of  our data, the relationships between a dip one ct in  levels and IS were not analyzed. Thus, further studies  will be needed to confirm the results.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

CDH13  genetic polymorphisms are associated  with a dip one ct in levels in IS free individuals.  CDH13 rs7193788 is associated with IS. An interaction is  found between  CDH13  SNP and diabetes for IS.
