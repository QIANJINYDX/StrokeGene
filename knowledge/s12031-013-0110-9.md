Abstract  Cerebral atherosclerosis vascular stenosis is a common etiology for ischemic stroke and a major factor in recurrent stroke and vascular mortality. Recent studies suggest that renalase plays a role in hypertension and ischemic stroke, and may be involved in atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there were correlations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the renalase  gene and severity of intra cranial cerebral atherosclerotic vascular stenosis in ischemic stroke patients as determined by imaging. A total of 212 ischemic stroke patients and 244 healthy controls from the north Chinese Han population were enrolled in this study. Polymerase chain reaction and ligase detection reaction were used for SNP analysis. We classified the case samples by severity of the intra cranial cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis. Allele, genotype, and haplotype were analyzed in cases and controls, and logistic regression was used to adjust for bias due to conventional stroke risk factors. The allele and the genotype of rs10887800 in the  renalase  gene were both associated with severe intracranial cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis   $(p\!=\!0.013$  and  $p\!=\!0.049$  , respectively). No association was observed with severity for SNP rs2576178 or SNP rs2296545. Our findings show that the SNP rs10887800 in the  renalase  gene is closely associated with severe intra cranial cerebral atherosclerotic vascular stenosis in ischemic stroke patients of north Chinese Han origin.

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke is a common neurological disease and a leading cause of death and adult disability in China (Zhao et al.  2012 ). Ischemic stroke is the most common subtype of stroke, and between 45 and   $75\ \%$   of strokes suffered by patients in China are ischemic (Zhang et al.  2003 ). Ischemic stroke is a complicated clinical syndrome or multi factorial disorder caused by environmental and genetic factors (DellaMorte et al.  2012 ; Chehaibi et al.  2013 ). Intra cranial athero- sclerotic stenosis, which is a narrowing of the intra cranial artery, and carotid at hero sclerotic stenosis, which is a common etiology of ischemic stroke (Gorelick et al.  2008 ), are major factors in recurrent stroke and vascular mortality (Kasner et al. 2006 ). Non-invasive cerebro vascular imaging using techniques such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or conventional angiogram can be used to determine the location of lesions and to evaluate the degree of vascular stenosis (Kim et al.  2006 ). Previous studies have shown that carotid atherosclerotic stenosis is regulated by genetic factors, and a few studies have focused on the relationship between carotid stenosis and gene polymorphisms (Giacconi et al.  2007 ).  

In 2005, human renalase was described by Xu et al.; this protein is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent amine oxidase that is highly expressed in the kidneys and heart. Renalase metabolizes cate chola mines and cate chola minelike substances (Xu et al.  2005 ) and plays a direct and significant role in the regulation of blood pressure (Zhao et al.  2007 ; Desir  2007 ; Desir  2012 ; Wu et al.  2011 ). Inhibition of renalase results in a dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure, heart rate, myocardial contract ili ty, and vascular tone in animal studies (Li et al.  2008 ; Gu et al.  2011 ); these are all risk factors for at hero thrombosis and stroke (Barrett et al.  2009 ; Bur a czy nsk a et al.  2011 ; Malyszko et al.  2012 ). It is likely that renalase is associated with atherosclerosis in ischemic stroke, and the study of renalase may enhance our knowledge of atherosclerosis mechanisms in ischemic stroke pathology.  

In the previous studies, the  renalase  gene was found to be associated with hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. In our previous study, we found that the three variants in the  renalase gene were associated with ischemic stroke (Zhang et al.  2013 ). Atheromatous plaque formation is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, so the aim of the study was to investigate the relation between the severity of intra cranial cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis in ischemic stroke patients as determined by imaging and the presence of  renalase  variants. In this study, the SNPs in the  renalase  genes of 212 ischemic stroke patients and 244 control subjects were evaluated. The severity of cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis in patients was determined by imaging, and physiological and biochemical indices were analyzed.  

# Materials and Methods  

Subjects  

Our study consecutively recruited 212 unrelated ischemic stroke patients of the north Chinese Han ethnicity; all were recruited from the same stroke center (Neurology Department of The Second Hospital affiliated with the Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China). All patients underwent computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. To determine the location and the severity of atherosclerosis of the brain supplying the arteries, 212 patients were all subjected to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or MRA. A total of 244 normal controls were also enrolled in this study. None of the controls had a history of stroke or other central nervous system disorders. Upon neurological examination, no focal signs were detected, and all the controls were free of hypertension and diabetes, and blood lipid levels were normal. Among the normal controls, 80 subjects received brain CT or MRI scans, and no disorders were detected. Detailed information about stroke risk factors, including gender, age, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, blood lipid levels, smoking, and alcohol use, for both cases and controls was collected. All participants signed research informed consent forms. The study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of The Second Hospital affiliated with Harbin Medical University.  

Evaluation of Cerebral Atherosclerosis with DSA and MRA  

In this study, we utilized DSA and MRA to evaluate the severity of cerebral atherosclerosis. In principle, this type of evaluation reveals the severity of stenosis in the brain supplying the arteries, including bilateral common carotid, internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, vert ebro basil ar artery, and posterior cere- bral artery. The North American Symptomatic Carotid End art erect o my Trail standard was adopted to measure the stenosis (Kappelle et al.  1999 ). Stenosis of the above arteries of less than   $50\ \%$   was defined as mild stenosis, and more than   $50\ \%$   was severe stenosis.  

Genotype Analysis  

We analyzed three SNPs previously found to be associated with ischemic stroke in the Chinese population (Zhang et al. 2013 ). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood anti-coagulated with EDTA by standard methods. Three SNPs in  renalase  were identified, and all the genotyping was done using the ligase detection reaction (LDR) (Huang et al.  2008 ) by the Shanghai BioWing Applied Biotechnology Company ( http://www.biowing.com.cn ). The primers used were as follows: rs10887800: forward,   $5^{\prime}$  -G CACA A GG AAC CCTGGTTTA $\cdot3^{\prime}$   and reverse,   $5^{\prime}$  -T GG CCCC T CTA TTT CCTCTT $.3^{\prime}$  ; rs2576178: forward,   $5^{\prime}$  -AGT GG CCG TTC A A GCATTAG $\cdot3^{\prime}$   and reverse,   $5^{\prime}$  -AAAA GCC TG GAA AT G GTGTG $.3^{\prime}$  ; rs2296545: forward,   $5^{\prime}$  -GC TC A GG GAG CT GA GGGTAT $\cdot3^{\prime}$   and reverse   $5^{\prime}$  -TAC CT TG CT GT GT GG G ACAA $\cdot3^{\prime}$  . Genomic DNA was amplified in a   $20\ \ \upmu\mathrm{L}$  reaction. PCR amplification reactions were carried out as follows:   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $15~\mathrm{min}$   and   $94~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 30s (de natura tion),  $59~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\ \mathrm{min}$   and 30s (annealing), and   $72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\ \mathrm{min}$  (extension) for 35 cycles; and   $72\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10~\mathrm{min}$  . The PCR product size was analyzed on a  $3\,\%$   agarose gel electrophoresis. The LDR was performed in   $10{\mathrm{-}}\upmu\mathrm{L}$   reaction mixture containing  $1~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of   $1\times$   buffer,   $1~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of probe mix   $(12.5\ \mathrm{pmol}/\upmu\mathrm{L}$   each probe),  $0.05~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of  $2\,\mathrm{U}$   ligase (NEB Biotechnology) and  ${\ge}1~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  of   $100~\mathrm{{ng}/\upmu L}$   PCR product. The fluorescent products of the LDR were separated on an ABI 377 Sequencer, and the results were analyzed with GeneMapper software. The quality of genotyping was controlled using blind blood duplicates   $(n\!=\!40)$  ).

distributions were compared using the    $\chi^{2}$    test. The Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium was assessed using the    $\chi^{2}$    test. The characteristics of the cases and controls were analyzed with the SPSS 18.0 for Windows software. The continuous variables in the physiological and biochemical indexes were analyzed using Student ’ s  $t$   test, and the categorical variables were analyzed using  $\chi^{2}$    test. The SHEsis software was also used to test the linkage d is equilibrium between the SNPs and to calculate the haplotype frequency. The lowest frequency threshold for haplotype analysis was 0.03.  $P\!<\!0.05$   was considered statistically significant.  

# Logistic Regression Analysis  

Logistic regression (using SPSS 18.0 for Windows) was used to adjust for covariates, including gender, age, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, blood lipid levels, smoking, and alcohol use, and genotype of each SNP for the cases and controls.

patients were smokers and alcoholics. The patients also have hypertension. On average, the cases had higher body mass indices (BMI) than the controls. The systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose levels, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein levels were significantly higher in patients than those in controls, whereas the highdensity lipoprotein levels were significantly lower in patients than those in controls.  

Relationship Between Cerebral At hero sclerotic Vascular Stenosis and Renalase Polymorphism  

We analyzed the genotype and allele frequencies of the renalase  gene in patients who underwent intra cranial DSA or MRA. No significant deviation from the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium was found in the cases and controls for any polymorphism. The genotype and allele frequencies of each polymorphism in all subjects are shown in Table  2 . Using univariate analyses to test the association between polymorphisms and disease, no significant difference was observed in the genotypic distribution between the patients and control subjects. We also compared  renalase  polymorphisms between the groups with severe intra cranial cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis or mild intra cranial cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis group and controls (Table  3 ). A significant difference was observed in the genotypic distribution

  $(p\!=\!0.049)$   and allele frequency (  $[\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.55$  ;   $95\ \%$     $\mathrm{CI}=$  1.095 – 2.199;  $p\!=\!0.013$  ) of rs10887800 polymorphism between patients with severe intra cranial cerebral artery stenosis and controls.  

# Haplotype Frequency Analysis  

A genetic association with ischemic stroke was further investigated by examining the frequencies of the haplotypes with frequencies of more than 0.03 (Table  4 ). No significant differences were found.

# Logistic Regression Analysis  

After adjustment by age, gender, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose levels, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein levels, smoking, and alcohol consumption in a logistic regression model, neither the genotype nor the allele frequencies of the studied polymorphisms were significantly different between the patients and the control subjects.  

# Discussion  

In our study, we analyzed the relationship of the  renalase  gene variants and the severity of stenosis of the intra cranial cerebral artery in Chinese Han stroke patients, the patients also have hypertension. The present report is the first to provide evidence of an association of a  renalase  SNP and severity of intra cranial cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis analyzed by imaging.  

A study by Bur a czy nsk a et al. ( 2011 ) showed that the rs10887800 polymorphism was associated with stroke. Our preliminary study suggested that the rs10887800 polymorphism was associated with at hero thrombosis and lacunar combination in a subgroup of ischemic stroke patients (allele,  $p\!=\!0.039$  ; recessive model distribution,  $p\!=\!0.043)$  ) (Zhang et al.  2013 ). In the present study, we further evaluated the relationship of the  renalase  gene variants with the severity of intra cranial cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis as determined by imaging of Chinese Han patients with ischemic stroke. The cerebral artery stenosis is reflective of the severity of cerebral atherosclerosis, and DSA and MRA were established in the present study as tools that accurately reflect the severity of cerebral atherosclerosis. We divided the ischemic stroke patients into two subgroups, mild stenosis group and severe stenosis group. The G allele and the rs10887800 genotype were significantly associated with severe intracranial artery stenosis. The presence of the G allele with the rs10887800 polymorphism resulted in an increased risk of severe intra cranial cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis in ischemic stroke patients   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.55$  ;   $95\ \%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!1.095_{-}$  2.199;  $p\!=\!0.013$  ). The results of our study in the Chinese Han population are consistent with previous studies (Zhang et al.  2013 ; Bur a czy nsk a et al.  2011 ). This may indicate that rs10887800 polymorphism affected ischemic stroke risk through an impact on atherosclerosis.  

Associations of the levels of SNPs rs2576178 and rs2296545 with either stroke or controls did not reach statistical significance. Ischemic stroke is a complicated clinical syndrome, and many components are involved in its pathology including genetic predisposition and environmental factors (Alrajeh and Alkali  2008 ). Post-transcriptional regulation may play a large role in the development of disease in response to the environment (Meng et al.  2012 ). A previous study from Zhao et al. ( 2007 ) showed that these two SNPs were associated with essential hypertension, so ischemic stroke might be affected by the two SNPs through hypertension. In our haplotype analysis, no significant differences were found. Our data do show that the rs10887800 SNP of the  renalase  gene is associated with server intra cranial cerebral at hero sclerotic vascular stenosis in ischemic Chinese Han stroke patients, suggesting that the product of the  renalase  gene may be involved in ischemic stroke pathology.
