# Abstract  

Background:  Lymph o toxin-alpha ( LTA ), a pro inflammatory cytokine, is significantly associated with the progression of atherosclerosis as an independent hazard factor for stroke. According to new genetic studies, polymorphisms in the  LTA  gene that influence its expression or biological function may play a role in the progress of stroke; thus, the present case – control study investigated  LTA  gene polymorphisms (rs909253, rs1800683 and rs2229094) and the risk of large artery atherosclerosis stroke (LAA) in an Iranian population.  

Methods:  For 211 large artery atherosclerosis patients and 186 ischemic strokefree controls, genotypes were determined using the tetra-primer amplificationrefractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction method. Linkage disequilibrium and estimated haplotypes were analyzed using SNP Analyzer 2 software. The strength of the link between LTA gene polymorphisms (rs1800683, rs909253, and rs2229094) and the risk of stroke was determined using conditional logistic regression.  

Results:  Analysis revealed that the patterns of the rs1800683, rs909253 and rs2229094 genotypes showed no significant difference between the LAA and control group, although the distribution of the GAT (rs1800683G, rs909253A and rs2229094T) haplotype was significantly higher in the control group (odds ratio   $=$  0.707, $95\%$  confidence interval $=0.53–0.942$ , $p=0.0355.$ ).  

Conclusions:  Our results indicate that the GAT haplotype in  LTA  gene is associated with a decreased risk of LAA incidence in a northeastern Iranian population.

lymphotoxin-alpha, rs1800683, rs2229094, rs909253, stroke  

1 | INTRODUCTION  

Stroke or atherosclerosis is one of the most familiar causes of mortality, influencing individuals' lives in most of developed countries tremendously.   Stroke is a main cause of death and inability in adults worldwide. Approximately  $84\%$   of strokes are ischemic and   $16\%$   are hemorrhagic.   large artery at hero sclerotic stroke (LAAS) is the main subtype of ischemic stroke.   The mechanisms of stroke remain uncertain yet, although it is considered to be an intricate, multi factorial disorder in which the individual's genetic background and numerous  

environmental factors interact. Significant efforts are currently being devoted to the identification of the unfavorable gene polymorphisms that could give rise to the progress of ischemic stroke (IS) as independent e tio logical factors. – 5   So far, it has been reported that some cytokine genes are linked with the risk of IS such as  Lymph o toxinalpha  ( LTA ). Lymph o toxin-alpha is one of the pro-inflammatory cytokines could be produced mostly by lymphocytes in response to cellular damage that is a factor promoting the progress of atherosclerosis.   The  LTA  gene in human is found on chromosome 6 (6p21) and is expressed in at hero sclerotic plaques.   Furthermore, LTA  could induce adhesion molecules or several cytokines expression in vascular cells, smooth muscle cells and some types of leukocytes; these material are present in at hero sclerotic plaques and they have elevated levels in cerebro vascular diseases such as stroke.   This could clarify the association of the  LTA  gene and an elevated risk of stroke. The levels and biological function of the correspondent proteins are affected by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of inflammatory genes that could lead to likely significant clinical implications. Studies have confirmed that polymorphism in  LTA  gene could increase the transcriptional level of this gene, which promotes postischemic inflammation.   Thus, it is suggested that the presence of special SNPs ultimately would affect the promotion of a the rogen ic processes in general. It has recently been reported that polymorphisms at positions rs909253 and rs1800683 of the  LTA gene may associate with an indication of stroke in some populations 12 – 15 ; however, other studies have provided conflicting data.   The present study investigated the hypothesis that there is a link between polymorphisms of the  LTA  gene and the incidence of IS in Iran. Accordingly, the rs1800683, rs909253 and rs2229094 polymorphisms of the  LTA  gene were analysed in LAA (large artery atherosclerosis) patients and also in sexand age-matched community-based control subjects.  

# 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# 2.1 |  Subjects  

This case – control study involved 211 hospitalized LAA patients and 186 neuro imaging alteration- and stroke-free controls from Iranian population from 2017 to 2018. After confirming stroke by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, the patients were enrolled. Based on random iz ation, controls were chosen who were the same age and gender from general practice registers from the same locality as the cases; they were required to have negative brain MRI or CT scan results. They were in good health and were considered not to have any cerebro vascular disease. The exclusion criteria were: previous ischemic attack, any acute or chronic disease and previous immuno suppress ive therapies. The study design was permitted by the local ethics committee. The informed consent was signed by all subjects. Single-time  $_{6-{\mathsf{m}}|}$   peripheral blood samples were collected in ethylene dia mine tetra c acetic acid-treated vials from the samples.  

# 2.1.1 |  Biochemical analysis  

After an overnight fast, single-time 4-ml peripheral blood samples were collected from subjects, which were immediately centrifuged 3200 rpm (1147 RCF) for 35 minutes at   $5^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  ; the biochemical markers were determined using the separated serum. Typical enzymatic quant if i cation kits (Pars Azmoon, Tehran, Iran) were used to determine total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from a clinical standpoint.  

# 2.1.2 |  Bioinformatics analysis  

The promoter region of the  LTA  gene was extracted using the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu) to highlight the probable functionality of SNPs in the  LTA  promoter. The influence of SNPs on the possible binding site of transcription factors was surveyed based on the TRANSFAC database using PROMO software (http://alggen.lsi.upc.es).   Furthermore based on the NCBI SNP database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp), SNPs with a minor allele frequency  $>10\%$   were selected for experimental investigation, including rs1800683, rs909253 and rs2229094 in the  LTA promoter region.  

Using the RegulomeDB database,   the potential functions of the selected SNPs were investigated. Furthermore, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data for the selected SNPs were extracted from the GTEx website.  

# 2.1.3 |  DNA isolation and genotyping  

The salting-out procedure was used to extract DNA from whole blood; then rs909253, rs1800683 and rs2229094 polymorphisms (previous names are  $252\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G}$  , 10G/A and 496 T/C respectively) in the  LTA  gene were examined with a tetra-primer amplification-refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS PCR) assay. A list of the primers is provided in the Supporting information (Table S1). The primers were designed for the single-nucleotide polymorphisms using the PRIMER1 online tool (http://primer1.soton.ac.uk/primer1.html). The PCR was performed, which contained dNTPs at a concentration of  $200~\upmu\mathrm{{m}o l/\upmu}$   each,   $1\,\mathrm{\mm{o}l/l\,\mathrm{\Mg{C}l}_{2}}$  enzyme,   $5~\upmu$  500 mmol/l KCl and   $15\,\mathsf{\ m m o l}/1\,\mathsf{\ M g C l}_{2})$  ,   $0.2\,\mathrm{\upmumot}/1$   each primer and   $1~{\upmu}{\mathrm{I}}$   of DNA. The reaction was repeated for 35 cycles. The thermo-cycling setting were: pre-de natura tion for 7 min at  $94^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  , de natura tion for 30s at   $94^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  , annealing 30s at   $55^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for rs909253 and 30s at   $58^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for rs1800683 and rs2229094 polymorphisms, primer extension 35 s at   $72^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for rs909253 and 50s at   $72^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for rs1800683 and rs2229094 polymorphisms, and final extension at   $72^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for  $7\ \mathsf{m i n}$  .  

# 2.2 |  Statistical analysis  

The frequency of the different genotypes was compared in the stroke group versus the control group using the chi-squared test. The Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium was estimated for case and control groups. The assessment of each polymorphism with respect to analyzing the link between genotype and IS was conducted based on the dominant model   $(\mathsf{A G}+\mathsf{G G}$   versus AA for rs909253;   $\mathsf{G A}+\mathsf{A A}$   versus GG for rs1800683;  $\mathsf{C T}+\mathsf{C C}$   versus TT for rs2229094) and recessive model (GG versus AA  $+\textsf{A G}$   for rs909253; AA versus   $\mathsf{G G}+\mathsf{G A}$   for rs1800683; CC versus TT  $+\,\mathsf{T C}$   for rs2229094). Odds ratios (ORs) and  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by binary logistic regression in SPSS, version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Linkage d is equilibrium (LD) and estimated haplotypes were analyzed using SNP Analyzer  $2^{19}\,p<0.05$   was considered statistically significant.

# 3 | RESULTS  

After screening, 211 LAA cases were selected for the present study. For the control group, 250 individuals were screened and 186 controls with same age and gender were chosen. Clinical characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1. Genetic analysis for  LTA  gene selected polymorphisms was conducted for all cases and controls. The distribution of the genotypes corresponded to Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium  $(p>0.05)$  . The frequency of mutated alleles for  LAA  SNPs in stroke and control subjects is depicted inTable 2.  

Table 3 shows the distribution of genotype and allele frequencies for these polymorphisms among cases and controls. To highlight the interaction of each mutated allele with the risk for LAA stroke, logistic regression analyses were conducted with respect to a genotypic link analysis by assuming common models (co-dominant, dominant, recessive and allelic). The calculated ORs and   $95\%$  CIs are shown in Table 3 for each genotype. The frequencies of the rs909253 genotype differed for the LAA stroke and control groups in the dominant model (adjusted   $\mathsf{O R}~=~1.55$  ;   $95\%\,\textsf{C l}\;=$  1.019 – 2.36), However, after multiple compression adjustment for the    $p$  genotypes distribution did not differ significantly between the stroke group and the control group (Table 3).  

# 3.1  | Haplotype frequencies and distribution  

The haplotype estimation for the  LTA  gene with the target SNPs led to two haplotypes with frequencies  $>~5\%$  , the GAT haplotype (H1) with a frequency of 0.608 and the H2 haplotype (AGC) with completely opposing alleles to H1 (Figure 1B). The haplotype distributions of the  LTA  polymorphisms in the patients and controls are shown in Table 4. There was a link between the two SNPs in the present study   $(r^{2}\,=\,0.94068$  ,    $p\,<\,0.0001\rangle$   (Figure 1C). Among the possible haplotypes, three with the highest frequency in both groups were analyzed statistically. The (H1 and GAT) haplotype

frequencies among all subjects showed a significantly different distribution between the groups under the multiplicative model (  $({\mathsf{O R}}\,=$  0.707;   $95\%~{\sf C I}\,=\,0.53\mathrm{-}0.942$  ;  $p\,=\,0.0179,$  ) (Table 4). Further analy- sis revealed no significant association of haplotype H2 under the multiplicative model   $(\mathsf{O R}\ =\ 1.152\$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}~=~0.85–1.55,$  ) with the risk of IS (Table 4).  

# 3.2  | Alterations of assumed transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) by SNPs in the  LTA  promoter  

An investigation was conducted of the possible effects of the rs909253, rs1800683 and rs2229094 SNPs located within the  LTA promoter on the TFBS. PROMO software (http://alggen.lsi.upc.es) 16

was used to analyze the putative TFBS regions at 15 bp upstream and downstream of the selected polymorphic loci. According to the results, a mutation was capable of affecting the presence of several putative T FB S s around each SNP (Figure 1A).  

The RegulomeDB data show that the rs909253, rs1800683 and rs2229094 SNPs are located at the binding sites for several transcription factors, such as POLR2A, IKZF1 and TBX21 (see Supporting information, Figure S1). Furthermore the DNase-seq data revealed that the genomic regions of these SNPs are regulatory regions in multiple cell types, especially T-cells and B-cells (see Supporting information, Figure S2). An eQTL investigation based on GTEx data showed that the rs909253, rs1800683 and rs2229094 SNPs are significantly associated with the altered expression of 28, 28, and 16 genes, respectively (Figure 2; see Supporting information, Tables S2-S4) and the  LTA  gene was included in the gene set for all three SNPs. Furthermore, the extracted eQTL data showed that rs1800683 and rs909253 are significantly associated with a higher expression level of the  LTA  gene in human skeletal and cerebral tissues (see Supporting information, Figure S3).  

# 4 | DISCUSSION  

Stroke is a multifaceted disease, which is linked to some genetic factors. Attempts have been made to identify stroke susceptibility genes, determine unique molecular pathways and inhibit the development of LAA by conducting many genome association and candidate gene studies. So far, several genetic association studies have reported that there is a link between SNPs in the  LTA  gene with stroke onset.  LTA  is a pro-inflammatory cytokine similar to inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which is associated with progressive atherosclerosis.  

# 4.1  | Association study between rs909253, rs1800683 and rs2229094 SNPs and LAA  

In the present study, the association of three SNPs of the  LTA  gene, namely rs909253, rs1800683 and rs2229094, have investigated with respect to the risk of LAA stroke in a northeastern Iranian population. Although the exact mechanisms by which the  LTA  polymorphisms affect the inflammatory pathways are not yet fully understood, a study by Wang et al.   demonstrated that there is a link between some SNPs of  LTA  gene with the incidence of stroke. The present study showed an association between the G allele of rs909253 and IS incidence (Table 2) but, after multiple compression adjustment for the analysis, none of the polymorphisms showed a significant association with LAA (Table 3). Although no significant association was observed for the separate analysis of SNPs, haplotype analysis of the  

![](images/1106c2418a71b4f29136da5a3c65ecb2c6a7c721b48095ecd7c8fa56d5b5949d.jpg)  
FIGURE 2 Significant eQTL for rs909253, rs1800683 and rs2229094 SNPs in human tissues extracted from GTEx data. This data show that the selected SNPs are significantly associated with the altered expression of 28, 28 and 16 genes, respectively  

rs2229094 ,  rs909253 and rs1800683 polymorphisms showed that the GAT haplotype (including normal allele of the  LTA  gene) was associated with a decreased risk of IS incidence in the study population  $({\sf O R}~=~0.707$  ;    $p~=~0.0355,$  ) (Table 4). These findings suggest that rs2229094 and rs1800683, in interaction with rs909253, might be a main contributing factor to the incidence of stroke.  

The association of rs909253 polymorphism with IS incidence has been investigated in various populations. Kumar  et al.,   in their study of 250 IS patients and 250 controls, found significant association between rs909253 and the incidence of small vessel disease IS in a dominant model   $/\Omega R\,=\,2.06$  ;   $95\%~{\sf C I}\;=\;1.03–4.12;$  ;  $p\,=\,0.04,$  ). Zhao et al.   studied 1,124 IS patients and 1,163 controls from Han population and reported the   $\mathsf{G}$   allele of rs909253 as a risk factor for non-hypertensive IS   $\mathsf{\Lambda}\mathsf{P}\mathsf{R}\;=\;1.28\$  ;   $95\%$   CI, 1.03 – 1.59;    $p~=~0.028\rangle$  . Szolnoki et al.   showed that the  LTA  allele with rs909253 is a novel risk factor ischemic stroke. Um et al.   found an increased frequency of the rs909253 GG genotype in cerebral infarction patients compared to controls. However, a study conducted by Hagiwara et al.   involving 1044 IS cases and 1,044 controls did not find any significant association between rs909253   $(\mathsf{O R}\,=\,0.83\$  ;  $95\%~{\sf C I}\;=\;0.66\!-\!1.03)$   and the risk of IS and the results of a study by Freilinger et al,   involving 601 IS patients and 736 controls, did not show significant relationship between rs1800683 and IS incidence in European population.  

Our results for the separate analysis of SNPs are consistent with the results of Hagiwara et al.   (2008) and Freilinger et al,   although our analysis showed a significant association between the GAT haplotype and a decreased risk of LAA. These findings suggest that the combined effect of rs2229094 and rs1800683 and rs909253, might be a contributing factor for the incidence of LAA in the studied population. This result could be supported by the results of Kumar et al, Zhao et al. , Um et al.   and Szolnoki et al. .  

The inconsistency observed in the findings regarding the polymorphisms of interest in different populations may be attributable to demographic differences and the genetic background.  

# 4.2  | Bioinformatics and eQTL analyses  

According to some studies, variants in the promoter region of a gene were capable of influencing its gene expression by changing transcription factor binding sites.   Consequently, it is of tremendous signifi- cance to investigate the SNPs in the gene promoter region. Therefore, the likely functional outcomes of gene transcription of the  LTA -linked SNPs and haplotypes were investigated by conducting a bio in formatics analysis. The analysis revealed that the mutated alleles of the target SNPs were capable of affecting the binding of some TFs such as YY1, STAT4, GR-beta, POLR2A, IKZF1 and TBX21, as shown by bioinformatics studies (Figure 1A) and the RegulomeDB database (see Supporting information, Figure S1). Furthermore, DNase-seq data revealed that rs2229094, rs1800683 and rs909253 are located in regulatory regions in multiple cell types, especially T-cells and B-cells (see Supporting information, Figure S2). Therefore, the evidence obtained from the bioinformatics and the RegulomeDB database suggest the potential role of selected SNPs in the regulation of the  LTA  gene. These results could be validated by eQTL data extracted from GTEx database. eQTL analysis showed rs909253, rs1800683 and rs2229094 SNPs are significantly associated with the altered expression of multiple genes such as the  LTA  gene (Figure 2; see also Supporting information, Tables S2-S4). Furthermore, eQTL data and the results of Ozaki et al.   (2004) show that rs909253 and rs1800683 polymorphisms can increase  LTA  gene expression by up to 1.5 times (see Supporting information, Figure S3). Thereby, altering the transcription factors binding to the  LTA  gene and increasing the expression level of the  LTA  gene might comprises a possible mechanism for the contribution of rs909253 and rs1800683 to LAA.  

The present study has some limitations. This study focused on a subtype of IS. Consequently, further studies are essential to confirm the link between  LTA  variations and stroke risk in the other subtypes. Furthermore, the present study did not perform any functional analysis to shed light on the mechanism underlying the link between the SNPs and stroke. Despite these limitations, the present study has established that the rs909253 polymorphism of the  LTA  gene could play a major role in development of stroke in a northeastern Iranian population. Nonetheless, shedding light on the link between  LTA  gene SNPs with the risk of stroke diseases requires additional populationbased and functional studies.  

# 5 | CONCLUSIONS  

According to the findings of the present study, there is a link between the GAT haplotype of the  LTA  gene and a decreased susceptibility risk of LAA stroke in a northeastern Iranian population. Confirming these results in large studies could highlight the exact influence of the  LTA gene on the etiology of IS.
