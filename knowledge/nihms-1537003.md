# Abstract  

Despite negative association in cognition and memory, mice harboring Val66Met BDNF SNP   $\mathrm{(BDNF^{M/M})}$  ) exhibit enhanced motor recovery accompanied by elevated excitatory synaptic  markers VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in striatum contra lateral to unilateral ischemic stroke. The  cortico-striatal pathway is a critical gateway for plasticity of motor/gait function. We hypothesized  that enhanced excitability of the cortico-striatal pathway, especially of the contra lateral  hemisphere, underlies improved motor recovery. To test this hypothesis, we examined the key  molecules involving excitatory syn ap to genesis: Th rom bos pond in s (TSP1/2) and their neuronal  receptor   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$  . In WT brains, stroke induced expressions of TSP1/2-mRNA. The contra lateral  hemisphere of  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice showed heightened TSP2 and  $\mathsf{a28{-}1\,m R N A}$   and protein  specifically at 6 months post-stroke. Immuno reactivity of TSPs and   ${\bf a}2\delta{-}1$   were increased in  cortical layers 1/2 of stroked  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   animals compared to   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   sham brains at this time.  Areal density of excitatory synapses in cortical layer 1 and striatum were also increased in stroked   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{M}}$   brains, relative to stroked WT brains. Notably, the frequency of GABAergic synapses  was greatly reduced along distal dendrites in cortical layer 1 in  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   brains, whether or not  stroked, compared to WT brains. There was no effect of genotype or treatment upon the density of  GABAergic synapses onto striatal medium spiny neurons. The study identified molecular and  synaptic substrates in the contra lateral hemisphere of   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice, especially in cortical layers  1/2, which indicates selective region related synaptic plasticity. The study suggests that an increase  

in excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic balance along the contra lateral cortico-striatal pathway  underlies the enhanced functional recovery of   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice.  

# Introduction  

Genetic variants contribute to injury-induced structural plasticity and behavioral adaptation.  However, the underlying mechanisms by which genetic variants affect recovery in stroke are  not well understood. Brain-derived neuro troph ic factor (BDNF) is a widely expressed  neuro troph in in the CNS and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, memory, and  cognition  . A variant of the BDNF gene with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at  codon 66 has been identified in humans. The presence of this SNP is negatively associated  with cognition and memory and reduces activity-dependent BDNF secretion  3 . The effects  of Val66Met SNP on stroke outcome and rehabilitation remains to be fully elucidated  4 .  Earlier studies in stroke patients indicate a primarily maladaptive role with Met carriers,  based on worse functional outcomes  . Other studies indicated that Val66Met SNP is  associated with worse outcomes at early but not at later time points  . Moreover, under  certain conditions, it can promote improved outcomes  9 .  

Mice harboring the human BDNF Val66Met at both alleles   $\mathrm{\{BDNF}^{M/M}\}$  ) display an anxiety  phenotype and memory deficit, recapitulating traits in humans who carry the SNP.  Previously, we reported that  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice exhibit greater acute motor deficits but  unexpected enhancement of motor/gait function during the sub-acute and long-term recovery  phase following stroke  10 . The enhanced functional recovery in   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   was pronounced  in the ips i lesion al limbs, suggesting the involvement of contra lateral hemisphere. The  elevated expressions of excitatory synaptic markers VGLUT1/2 in the contra lateral striatum  suggested a link between excitatory synaptic substrates and superior stroke recovery.  

Th rom bos pond in s (TSPs) are large oligomeric extracellular glycoproteins that engage in  cell-matrix interactions and are implicated in multiple path o physiological states  11 . They  play a major role in tissue remodeling and regulate syn ap to genesis in the CNS  .  Secreted by astrocytes, TSP1/2 are considered to be essential signals for excitatory synapse  formation  . The formation of excitatory synapses is mediated through the binding of  TSPs to the  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$  , an auxiliary subunit of calcium channel.   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   was identified as the  neuronal TSP receptors responsible for the formation of CNS excitatory synapses  15 .  Over expression of   ${\bf a}2\delta{-}1$   increases excitatory connections, while the loss of  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$    profoundly reduces the number of excitatory synapses  . This indicates the role of   $\mathrm{Tsps}/\upalpha2\updelta{-}1$   interactions in excitatory syn ap to genesis.  

Functional recovery from stroke and repair of other CNS injuries requires enhanced synaptic  plasticity  . A shift in synaptic balance toward excitation, either by elevating excitatory  markers or reducing inhibitory signals, has been implicated in the improvement of stroke  recovery  . Given the fact that TSPs expressions increase in post-stroke brains,   and  that the   $\mathrm{Tsps}/{\upalpha}2\updelta{-}1$   interaction contributes to excitatory synaptic formation, we sought to  determine whether   $\mathrm{Tsps}/{\upalpha}2\updelta{-}1$   are the molecular and synaptic substrates that account for  the superior recovery in  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice. We hypothesized that improved motor recovery of   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice is due to increases the expressions of TSPs and   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   at excitatory  

synapses in the contra lateral hemispheres, which enhances excitatory-to-inhibitory balance  at synapses of the cortico-striatal pathway in the post-stroke brain. Here we show that,  indeed, stroke increases excitatory synaptic markers and synapses and reduces inhibitory  synapses in the contra lateral cortico-striatal pathway of  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice. Moreover, we  demonstrate that layers 1/2 of contra lateral cortex is a site of synaptic plasticity.  

# METHODS  

# Animals:  

Procedures for the use of animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use  Committee (IACUC) of Weill Cornell Medicine, National Institutes of Health, and ARRIVE  (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. C57bl/6,  $\mathrm{BDNF^{+/+}}$   (WT)  and  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{M/M}}$   male mice (3–4 months) were used. We used   $\mathrm{\BDNF^{+/+}}$   and BDNF M/M  litter mates from respective  $12\mathbf{x}$   heterozygote mating to match the genetic background within  a given experiment for the controlled pre clinical studies described  3 . The facility monitors  and maintains temperature, humidity, and a  $12\,\mathrm{h}$   light/dark cycle. Due to the nature of a  long-term study, mice were given a code (either tattoo or ear tag) at the beginning of the  study. Surgeons who performed sham or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)  were blinded to the animals. Animals’ identity was also blinded to the persons who  cry o sectioned, vibratome-sectioned or ultrathin-sectioned and evaluated outcomes. Sample  size for stroke outcome measurements was calculated a priori to be a minimum 10 by  predicting detectable differences to reach a power of 0.80 at a significance level of   ${<}0.05$  ,  assuming a   $40\%$   difference in mean and a   $30\%$   standard deviation  23  at the  $95\%$   confidence  level.  

# MCAO and chronic recovery model:  

Male WT and   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{M}}$   mice at 3–4 months of age were randomly assigned to undergo  sham or MCAO by using 6–0 Teflon-coated mono filament surgical sutures (Doccol Co.) for   $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$   as previously described  . Sham surgery consisted of exposure of the right carotid  artery at its bifurcation without occlusion under the same duration of anesthesia. The  transient MCAO perturbed blood flow in the striatum, thalamus, and the cortex unilaterally  with the striatum as the structure most affected by the occlusion. Body temperature was  maintained at  $37\pm0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   before, during, reperfusion phases as well as   $45\;\mathrm{{min}}$   of post-stroke  recovery period. A sizable infarction of around   $35\mathrm{mm}^{3}$   (  ${\sim}20\%$   ips i lesion al hemisphere) in  the MCA territory was produced at 3 days post-stroke  24 , which was accompanied by acute  motor and gait impairment, but with substantial spontaneous recovery by 2 weeks. Prior to  return home cages, mice were placed in a recovery cage while maintaining body temperature   $37\pm0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until the animal regained consciousness and resumed activity. Animals that  exhibited both CBF reduction of more than   $80\%$   during MCAO and CBF recovery of more  than  $80\%$   by   $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$   after reperfusion were included in the study. Saline was subcutaneous ly  administered daily and Hydrogel   $(\mathrm{Clustering}_{2}0)$  ) was given to prevent dehydration during the  first week of the post-stroke period twice a day. Mice typically started to regain body weight  around day 5–6 and continued to recover from stroke.  

# Tissue preparation for molecular analyses:  

As reported in a previous study  26 , sections were collected for each hemisphere to perform  molecular analyses at indicated time points from the brain regions spanning about  $7\:\mathrm{mm}$    ros tro caudal   $(+2.8\mathrm{mm}$   to  $-3.8\mathrm{mm}$   from bregma covering entire infarct region), including  both cortex and striatum.  

# TSP1/2,  ${\bf a}{\bf z}{\bf\delta}{\bf-}{\bf1}$  , and PSD-95 mRNA measurement:  

mRNA levels, were quantified with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) using fluorescent TaqMan technology as described previously  . PCR  primers and probes specific for the genes in this study were obtained as TaqMan predeveloped assay reagents for gene expression (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA). Primers  used were TSP1   $(\mathrm{Mm}01335418\_\mathrm{m}1)$  ), TSP2 (Mm01279240_m1),  ${\bf a}2\delta$  

$-1(\mathrm{Mm}00486607\_\mathrm{m}1)$  ), PSD-95   $(\mathrm{Mm00}492193\_\mathrm{m1})$  ), and  $\upbeta$  -actin (Mm00607939_s1).  ${\upbeta}.$  - Actin was used as an internal control for normalization of samples. The PCR reaction was  performed in  $20\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   total volume using FastStart Universal Probe Master Mix (Roche,  Indianapolis, IN) by incubating at  $95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$   followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at  $95\mathrm{^\circC}$    and 1 min at   $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The results were analyzed using 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System  software (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).  

# α 2 δ −1 protein measurement:  

Brain sections were homogenized in CelLytic buffer (Sigma, MO) containing protease  inhibitors (Roche). Fifty  $\upmu\mathrm{g}$   of protein was loaded on a NuPAGE  $4–12\%$   Bis-Tris Gel (Life  Technology) and transferred onto a polyvinyl ide ne fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules,  CA). Briefly, the membrane was incubated at  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   with  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   (D219, 1:1,000 Sigma) or  ${\upbeta}.$  - Actin (sc-1615, 1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody overnight. Membranes were  incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 (A 21088, Life  Technologies), or IRDye  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   680RD (926–68071, Li-cor). Each protein’s specific band was  visualized using the Odyssey Imaging System (Li-cor).  

# Tissue preparation for light and electron microscopy (LM and EM):  

Three to four months-old  $\mathrm{BDNF^{+/+}}$   and  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice underwent either sham or MCAO.  Six months after, animals were anesthetized and trans card i ally perfused with a fixative  consisting of   $4\%$   para formaldehyde buffered by 0.1M phosphate buffer. Brains were postfixed for a minimum of 3 days before preparing coronal sections using a vibrating  microtome set at a thickness of  $50\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$  . Sections were allocated across three staining  procedures: LM-immuno cyto chemistry (LM-ICC) to measure regional densities of  ${\bf a}2\delta{-}1$  ;  EM-ICC to detect areal frequencies of inhibitory synapses formed by axon terminals  immuno reactive for the GABAergic marker, glutamic acid de carboxyl as e (GAD); and EM  without ICC to quantify the areal density of excitatory synapses formed onto pyramidal  neurons in cortex and medium spiny neurons (MSN) in striatum, so identified based on the  morphology of the synapses as asymmetric and with thick post synaptic densities (PSDs),  formed on dendritic spine heads.  

# LM-ICC detection of TSP1/2,  α 2 δ −1:  

One section containing the cortico-striatal path was chosen randomly from a collection of   $50\upmu\mathrm{m}$   vibratome sections of each animal. Briefly, free-floating sections were incubated with  mouse anti-th rom bos pond in s (1:100, Abcam ab1823), or mouse anti ${\bf{\cdot a}}2\updelta{-}1$   (1:100) and  secondary antibody (1:2000, Alexa Fluor  $\cdot@$   594). The negative control sample was treated  with the absence of primary antibody. Images were obtained all at once using an inverted  Nikon Eclipse Ti-U confocal microscope.  

# LM-ICC detection of   ${\bf a}{\bf z}{\bf\delta}{\bf-}{\bf1}$   with silver-intensified gold (SIG) and quant if i cation:  

Specificity of the  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   antibody (Sigma D219) was previously validated  29 . One section  containing the cortico-striatal path was packed randomly from a collection of vibratome  sections of each animals. Briefly, free-floating sections were incubated with mouse anti ${\bf\cdot}{\bf a}2\delta$   $^{-1}$   (1:100). Immuno reactivity was detected by the SIG procedure using goat anti-mouse IgG  conjugated to  $0.8\;\mathrm{nm}$   colloidal gold (1:100, EMSciences Cat No. 25121), as described  previously  30 . All sections were scanned at once, using VS120 (Olympus) at a magnification  of 2X and 10X. Auto-corrections were turned off to avoid introducing inter-animal  var i abilities arising from the image capturing step. The grey values ranged from 0 to 255,  with higher values indicating less labeling. The background grey values were measured from  tissue that underwent the identical ICC procedure  30  in parallel but for which the initial  incubation in the absence of primary antibody. The difference in the measured greyscale  values from the background values was plotted using reversed grey scale, whereby the  background was equal to zero.  

# EM detection of axo-spinous synapses and quant if i cation:  

Two brain sub-regions were analyzed: Layer 1 of cerebral cortex for the analysis of  excitatory axo-spinous synapses onto apical dendritic tuft spines of pyramidal neurons, and  dor so lateral striatum for the analysis of excitatory axo-spinous synapses onto MSN. The  sample size per brain region per animal was equalized across animals. Excitatory axospinous synapses were identified using criteria used previously  31  by the presence of thick  PSDs within spines that were devoid of mitochondria, gathering of small clear vesicles in  axon terminals, and parallel alignment of the plasma membrane of the axon terminal facing  the spine plasma membrane associated with the PSD.  

# EM-ICC detection of GAD and quant if i cation of GABAergic synapses:  

Specificity of the antibody used to detect GAD65 and GAD67 isoforms (AB1511,  Chemicon,) was established previously  . The procedure for EM-ICC and quant if i cation  of GABAergic synapses was performed as described previously using HRP-DAB as the  immuno label  33 . EM samples were imaged strictly in the order of encounter from portions of  the ultrathin sections showing the tissue-to-plastic transition, so as to ensure random  sampling from a portion of the vibratome section that was nearest to the surface where  access to immuno reagents would be the greatest. The sample size per brain region per  animal was equalized. For the assessment of the proportion of layer 5 pyramidal cell body  plasma membrane contacted GABAergic axo-somatic synapse lengths, 5 cell bodies per  brain region per animal were analyzed. To assess the proportion of the plasma membrane of  spiny dendrites in layer 1 and dorsal striatum that were contacted by GABAergic axon  terminals, 10 dendritic profiles were sampled from each brain, using electron micrographs  that were captured at a magnification of   $25{,}000{\bf x}$  .  

# Statistical analyses  

mRNA levels were expressed as mean  $\pm$   SEM and statistical comparison were made using  one-way ANOVA followed by Post hoc tests for multiple comparison and the Student’s t-test  for two groups. For LM and EM studies, the Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric test was used,  followed by un corrected Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons to identify genotype and  treatment effects. Differences were considered statistically significant at  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05$  .  

# Results  

# TSP2 expression in brain is elevated in BDNF M/M  mice at 6 months after stroke  

Stroke increases the expressions of TSPs in acute and subacute phases of stroke  21 . To  address changes of TSP genes during stroke recovery, their expressions were measured in  the brains of WT mice between 2 weeks to 6 months post-stroke. The hemisphere  contra lateral to unilateral ischemic stroke showed a moderate but significant elevation of  TSP1-, but not TSP2-mRNA levels, compared to pre-stroke levels (Figure 1A, B). There  were significant up-regulations of TSP1 and 2 in the stroke hemisphere at 2 weeks and 2  months after stroke. The chronic up regulation of TSPs in both hemispheres suggests a  contributing role of TSPs to continual tissue remodeling in both hemispheres following  stroke.  

Prompted by a previous finding of increased striatal volume and in the contra lateral  hemisphere in   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice at 6 months post-stroke  10 , we sought to determine the effect  of a BDNF SNP on stroke-induced TSPs expressions. Compared to WT mice, there was no  noticeable increase in TSP1 mRNA levels in the  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice after stroke, where TSP1  mRNA shows a significant reduction in the ips i lateral hemisphere (Figure 1C). However,  TSP2 gene expression was significantly increased in both hemispheres of  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice at  6 months after stroke, but not at earlier time points (Figure 1D). The up regulation of TSP2  gene expression was more pronounced in the contra lateral hemispheres. The  immuno reactivity of TSP1/2 revealed a widespread expression in cerebral cortex with  stronger immuno reactivity in layer 2 of cerebral cortex (Figure 1E), and much less  immuno reactivity in striatum (inset). Mean optical intensities of TSP in cortical layers 1 and  2 show a trend of increase in   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   -stoke animals compared to  $\mathrm{\BDNF^{+/+}}$  stroke mice  (Figure 1F). However, TSP immuno reactivity in layer 2 in   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   -stoke mice showed  significantly higher intensity than   $\mathrm{BDNF^{+/+}}$  -stoke mice when immuno reactivity in layer 4  was subtracted as the internal background   $(p{<}0.05)$  .  

# Increased  α 2 δ −1 expression in the contra lateral hemisphere of BDNF M/M  mice 6 months  after stroke  

The gene expression profiles of   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$  , a neuronal receptor for TSPs, and PSD-95, an  excitatory post-synaptic marker, were determined. Unlike TSPs, stroke induced attenuation  in the genes expressions of   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   and PSD-95 throughout the recovery phase spanning  

from 2 weeks to 6 months after stroke (Figure 2A–B). We found no significant differences in  the expressions of  ${\bf a}2\delta{-}1$   and PSD-95 in   $\mathrm{BDNF^{+/+}}$   and  $\mathrm{\bfBondownSF^{M/M}}$   brains at early time  points (2w and 1m post-stroke, data not shown). We further determined genotype differences  in the expressions of   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   and PSD-95 at 6 months. In age-matched sham mice, we did  not observe a genotype difference. In the stroked animals,  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   expression in the   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice was significantly elevated only in the contra lateral hemisphere while  PSD-95-mRNA levels were not differed among sham, post-stroke WT or   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   brains  (Figure 2C–D). Furthermore,  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   protein expression was also increased only in the  contra lateral hemisphere at this time (Figure 2E–F), paralleling the   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   gene  up regulation. The selective increase in the expression of  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   along with elevated TSP2  expression in the contra lateral hemisphere suggests a potential shift of synaptic balance  toward excitation in this non-stroked hemisphere of  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice.  

# Selective increase in  ${\bf a}{\bf z}{\bf\delta}{\bf-}{\bf1}$   immuno reactivity in the contra lateral cortical layers 1/2 of  BDNF M/M  mice.  

The selectively increased expression of   $\mathrm{TSP2}/\upalpha\mathrm{2}\updelta{-1}$   in the contra lateral hemisphere led us  to determine the sub-region specificity. Localization of  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   protein was assessed in the  dor so lateral striatum, medial striatum, layer 5 of somatosensory cortex and layer 1 of  somatosensory cortex in the contra lateral hemisphere (Figure 3A). Optical density  measurements revealed a significant (  $\tt(p{=}0.031$  , Kruskall-Wallis mean rank difference  $=$   

 8.943) and robust   $(101\%)$   increase of   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   immuno reactivity in layer 1 of cortex of 

  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{M/M}}$  -stroke mice compared to that of   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   -sham (Figure 3B). No difference  was found in brain areas of WT mice. Layer 5 of cortex also exhibited an increase in the  stroked   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   brains, relative to sham-treated  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{M/M}}$     $(74\%)$   but this increase did not  reach statistical significance   $\mathrm{(p{=}0.07}$   Kruskall-Wallis mean rank difference  $=7.343.$  ). Neither  the dor so lateral nor the medial sectors of dorsal striatum revealed any genotype or treatment  effect. Higher magnification confocal micrographs showed visible   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$    immuno fluorescence in layer 1 of cerebral cortex, with strong staining visible in cell bodies  

of layer 2 (Figure 3C).  

# Increased axo-spinous excitatory synapses in the contra lateral cortex and dorsal striatum  of BDNF  ${\bf\cdot M/M}$   mice.  

The increased  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   immuno reactivity in layers  $1/2$   of the cortex in   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   stroke mice  led us to investigate potential increases of excitatory synapses in the contra lateral  hemisphere of BDNF SNP mice. EM quant if i cation of the areal density of excitatory axospinous synapses in layer 1 revealed a small but nearly significantly greater spine density for  the  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   tissue than of WTs that was recovering from stroke (  $8\%$   increase,  $\mathtt{p}{=}0.055$  )  (Figure 4C). Similarly, EM analysis of the areal frequency of axo-spinous excitatory  synapses in dorsal striatum revealed a significantly higher spine density in   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   tissue  than of WTs that were recovering from stroke (  $10\%$   increase,  $\mathtt{p}{=}0.018,$  ) (Figure 4D). No  genotype difference in the areal density of axo-spinous excitatory synapses was detected  among the sham-treated animals.  

# Reduced GABAergic in nerva tion of spiny dendrites in layer 1 and cell bodies of layer 5  pyramidal neurons in cortex of BDNF M/M  animals.  

Excitability of neurons is determined by the balance between inhibition and excitation. To  investigate the possibility of enhanced excitability of cerebral cortical neurons due to  reduced GABAergic inputs, GABAergic in nerva tion of pyramidal cell bodies in layer 5 of  cortex was assessed (Figure 5 A–E). BDNF M/M  animals showed significant reduction of  GABAergic in nerva tion at pyramidal cell bodies following sham, compared to WT sham   $\mathrm{\Delta(p{=}0.0208)}$  ) and similarly to stroked WT or  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   brains, indicating that the reduced  GABAergic in nerva tion is an intrinsic property associated  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   phenotype.  

The extent of GABAergic axon terminals forming inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of  pyramidal cells were measured by using spines protruding from dendritic shafts to identify  pyramidal cell dendrites (Figure 5 F–H). There was a significant  $45\%$   reduction of the  percent of the plasma membrane of spiny dendrites’ shafts contacted by  $\mathrm{GABAD+}$   axon  terminals in layer 1 of   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   sham mice, relative to WT sham mice (Figure 5H). For the  stroke-treated animals, there was also a significant decrease by  $47\%$   in the extent of  synapses formed by   $\mathrm{GABA}+$   axon terminals along dendritic plasma membranes of pyramidal  neurons of   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   tissue, compared to WT tissue. Altogether, the increase of excitatory  synapses, combined with the decrease of inhibitory synapses specifically in layer 1 of cortex  suggests an overall greater excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons following stroke in   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   brain compared to WT.  

# GABAergic in nerva tion of MSN in striatum is not affected by the genotype or treatment.  

BDNF is synthesized by cortical neurons projecting to striatum, but is not known to be  synthesized by neurons in the striatum. As expected, the genotype  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   showed no  effect upon GABAergic in nerva tion of MSNs in striatum, all of which arise from local  inhibitory neurons or axon collateral s of MSNs located within striatum. Moreover, although  the occurrence of excitatory synapses on MSNs was increased by the treatment of stroke of  BDNF M/M  animals, this treatment had no effect on the extent of GABAergic in nerva tion of  MSNs (Figure 5I–J). The increase of excitatory synapses without a change in inhibitory  synapses would result in enhanced overall excitability of MSNs of BDNF M/M  brains.  

# Discussion  

Stroke induces changes in molecular expression, structural plasticity, and behavioral  adaptation at acute, sub-acute, and long-term recovery phases. The temporal and spatial  changes through multiple stages in chronic stroke suggest that a single molecule may exert  differential effect(s) during specific stages of recovery, presumably through interaction with  different molecules. Our previous study addressed the impact of the genetic variant of bdnf,  val66met on stroke. The results showed that mice homozygous for the val66met allele   $\mathrm{(BDN}\mathrm{FM/M)}$  ) display a biphasic response: greater behavior impairment during the acute  phase but better function during recovery phases compared to WT mice  10 . The observed  spontaneous motor recovery starting at 2 weeks could be due to re establishment of the  excitatory/inhibitory balance within the direct pathways. On the other hand, reverberating  excitatory input through the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit depicted in Fig. 6 may account  for superior behavioral adaptation of   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice in the later, chronic phase. Prominent  motor/gait improvement in ips i lesion al limb during recovery was associated with elevated  expression of vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT1 and 2 and excitatory synaptic  molecules in the contra lateral striatum  10 . One aim of the current study was to assess  whether the superior behavioral adaptation of   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice occurs through the expression  of molecules that can boost the function of the excitatory cortico-striatal synaptic pathway  within the less affected contra lateral hemisphere. The significantly increased expressions of  TSP1/2 were shown at 2 weeks and 2 months, but not at 1 month during recovery phase in  WT stroke mice. The biphasic profile in the molecular expression within a complete context  of stroke stages suggests that the acute neurotoxic and inflammatory milieu induced by  stroke is replaced by a more permissive environment that facilitates the repair/recovery  processes. Indeed, we demonstrated that BDNF M/M  mice express higher TSP2 mRNA and  TSP proteins in layer 2 of the contra lateral cerebral cortex at 6 months of recovery from  stroke, which is consistent with the greater en sheath ment of synaptic clefts by astrocytes in  layers  $2/3~^{34}$  . This coincides with the increased expression of mRNA for its neuronal  receptor   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$  , known to be an excitatory syn ap to genesis agent. Moreover, LM- and EMimmuno cyto chemistry, together, revealed that the protein level is elevated detectably in  layers 1/2 of cerebral cortex, which further demonstrates a sustained involvement of  TSPs  $/{\upalpha}2\updelta{-}1$   in a region-specific manner.  

A second aim of the current study was to characterize the ultra structural and synaptic bases  for the enhanced compensatory motor function in these  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice following chronic  stroke. Neuronal activity regulates BDNF secretion, which is important for synaptic  plasticity  35–38 . The balance between excitation and inhibition at the level of synapses is  critical in processing sensory information, syn ap to genesis, motor activity and cognitive  function  . Imbalance between excitation and inhibition is implicated in neurological  disorders  42–44  and may be manifested immediately following stroke and during the  recovery phase from stroke. In this study, the use of   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   that exhibits selective  impairment of activity-dependent, but not constitutive, BDNF bio availability allowed us to  address the role of activity-dependent BDNF release in synaptic plasticity during the delayed  recovery phase following stroke. Previous studies showed that activity-dependent bdnf  transcription promotes inhibitory synapse maturation and sets the network-level adaptation  for synaptic balance  45–47 . Thus,  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice with reduced stroke-induced BDNF  secretion may have led to the reduction of inhibitory synapses that we detected, yielding a  shift towards increased excitatory-to-inhibitory synapse balance onto pyramidal cells in  cortex as late as 6 months post-stroke.  

Although biochemical and LM analyses of brain regions preclude assessments at the cellular  and synaptic levels, our rigorous EM data align well with the biochemical and LM data:  indeed, we demonstrated that excitatory synapses onto excitatory pyramidal cells was  greater in layer 1 of the cerebral cortex of   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   mice that underwent stroke, compared  to the level seen for WT litter mates. This supports the idea that the augmented level of   $\mathrm{TSP2}/\upalpha\mathrm{2}\updelta{-1}$   within cortex promoted syn ap to genesis following stroke, especially by  excitatory pyramidal cells of   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   cortex. We propose that the overall excitation of the  cortico-striatal pathway may underlie enhanced functional recovery in chronic stroke of   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice. The findings indicate that layers 1/2 of cortex is one main site of synaptic  plasticity exhibiting shifts in synaptic balance towards greater excitation in the contra lateral  striatum of   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice at 6 months post-stroke.  

A number of studies have pointed to the role of somatosensory cortex in motor learning  , the cerebral cortical region that we analyzed in this study. It was demonstrated that the  somatosensory cortex of mice plays an important role in forelimb motor adaptation, such as  updating motor commands as needed in order to reduce error of an acquired motor skill  involving pulling of a joystick  50 . It is likely that the challenge of regaining gait following  stroke demands update of motor commands involving synaptic plasticity of the  somatosensory cortex that is then propagated to plasticity of the cortico-striatal pathway. In  support of this idea, we showed that cell bodies of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, which are the  population of pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex that project to striatum, receive  less GABAergic in nerva tion, indicating increased excitability of these cells and increased  cortico-striatal drive.  

The striatum is a major sub cortical structure for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity  51  and  also important for motor learning related to rotarod performance, as the mice lacking the  excitatory receptor subunit NMDAR1 in the striatum exhibit disrupted motor learning and  synaptic plasticity in the striatum  52 . Therefore, we predicted that striatum would be the subregion that up regulates excitatory markers in the contra lateral hemisphere of BDNF M/M  mice. However, synaptic plasticity is a basis for alteration of neuronal circuitry and  functions, not restricted to discrete brain regions, such as the striatum. The excitatory  afferents from cortex and thalamus project to striatal inter neurons and medium spiny  neurons (MSNs)  53 . These striatal neurons form the direct and indirect connections  51 . The  direct pathway provides information on movement planning, initiation and motor sequence  selection, which facilitate movement. The indirect pathway suppresses movements that  would conflict with ongoing selected movements  54 . The enhanced motor/gait function in  BDNF M/M  mice post-stroke suggest that the direct pathway may be more involved (Figure  6). The enhanced output of inhibitory MSNs in the striatum may exert excitatory motor  signal through vent rome dial thalamus  , thereby intensifying excitation through the  cortico-striatal-thalamic pathway. This view is consistent with the known role of inhibitory  basal ganglia circuit for inducing excitatory signal from thalamus to cortex  57 . In particular,  since the vent rome dial thalamic input to cortex is predominantly in layer  $1\ ^{56,58}$  , the increase  specifically in layer 1 of both excitatory syn ap to genesis and  ${\bf a}2\delta{-}1$  -immuno reactivity  provides further support for the view that the direct pathway from basal ganglia is more  involved than is the indirect pathway. Future electrophysiology studies will address whether  the cellular and molecular changes that we detected indeed reflect enhanced synaptic activity  in the direct pathway.  

In summary, increased expression of excitatory synaptic markers TSP2 and   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   in the  BDNF MM  mice is associated with superior functional recovery from stroke. Systematic  analysis of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in sub-regions of contra lateral hemisphere  revealed that stroke increased  ${\tt a}2\updelta-\!1$   immuno reactivity, more excitatory synapses and less  inhibitory synapses in layers 1/2 of cortex, indicating layers  $1/2$   of contra lateral cortex to be  a main site for synaptic plasticity. In the striatum, there is an increase in excitatory synapses  with no changes in the inhibitory synapses, yielding a synaptic circuit that is overall more  excitable. An increase in excitatory-to-inhibitory ratio in cortico-basal ganglia pathway may  underlie the enhanced functional recovery of ips i lesion al limbs in  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice,  suggesting the importance of neural circuit for behavior adaptation in recovery function in  neurological disorders.

Light microscopic assessment of  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   immuno reactivity in the different brain regions of  contra lateral hemisphere in WT and  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   sham and 6 months post stroke mice. Panel  A,  Representative micrographs of a hemi-section containing cerebral cortex layers 1 (Ctx1)  and 5 (Ctx5), and the dor so lateral and medial striatum (DLS, MS) of a contra lateral  hemisphere of age matched WT and   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   sham and stroke mice immuno labeled for   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   using silver-intensified gold (SIG) as the immuno label. Portions of Ctx1 (white  asterisks) of representative sections from the four groups are also shown. A portion of a  section of an M/M-sham animal that underwent an identical immuno labeling procedure but  with the primary antibody omitted is shown at the bottom. A   $100\mathbf{x}$   (oil objective)  immuno fluorescent image of   ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   in a  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{M}}$   (M/M) stroke animal was captured  using an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti-U confocal microscope. The region shown is cortical  layers 1 and 2, with cell bodies in layer 2. Panels in  $\pmb{B}$   show mean  $\pm\,\mathrm{SEM}$   values of optical  density measurements reflecting  ${\bf a}2\delta{-}1$   immuno reactivity from each group, based on  images detected using silver-intensified gold as the label. Optical densities of dorsal  striatum, medial striatum, layer 1 and layer 5 of overlying cerebral cortex were assessed  using Image J’s rectangle selection of area to analyze the mean grey value under the tool,  Histogram. Statistical analysis was performed for four brain regions separately. Grey scale  values (right y-axis) obtained from each brain region were assessed for each brain. The  difference in the measured greyscale values from the background values obtained from  primary antibody omitted sections was plotted using reversed grey scale (left y-axis),  whereby the background was set to equal zero. Multiple comparisons revealed a significant  effect of   $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   stroke brains in layer 1 of cerebral cortex, relative to   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   sham  brains. No other region showed significant changes evoked by stroke or genotype.  $\tt N{=}5$    animals for M/M-sham and   $+/+$  -sham,  $\Nu{=}7$   animals for M/M-stroke and  $+/+$  -stroke. From  each animal, one randomly picked section underwent the immuno cyto chemical procedure.

Figure 5.  

GABAergic in nerva tion of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cortex and striatum were  analyzed within brains of WT and BDNF M/M  sham and 6 months stroke mice. Three brain  regions were analyzed: Layer 1 of cerebral cortex (for the analysis of inhibitory synapses  onto spiny dendrites of pyramidal neurons), layer 5 of cerebral cortex (for the analysis of  inhibitory synapses onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons’ cell bodies), and dor so lateral striatum  for the analysis of inhibitory synapses onto MSN. Panels  $A$   through  $\pmb{D}$   show representative  GABAergic in nerv at ions of pyramidal cell bodies in layer 5 of cerebral cortex in age  matched WT and  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$   sham and 6 months stroke mice. WT   $(+/+)$   sham (A),  BDNF M/M  (M/M) sham (B), WT stroke (C) and   $\mathrm{\bfBondownSF^{M/M}}$   stroke (D). Arrows point to the  plasma membrane that is post synaptic to GABAergic terminals, indicated by the HRP-DAB  reaction product reflecting immuno reactivity to GAD.  $\mathrm{Nu}=$   nucleus. White arrows point to  portions of the plasma membrane that are not receiving GABAergic synaptic input.  Micrographs were taken at a magnification of   $10{,}000\mathrm{x}.\,E_{\mathrm{z}}$  ,  Quant if i cation of the percent of  the plasma membrane of cell bodies contacted by GAD terminals in this region. Here and in  other graph panels, asterisk indicates significance at  $^{*}\!\mathrm{p}\!\times\!0.05$  . The bars represent the mean  $\pm$    SEM values of the four groups consisting of the genotype WT   $(+/+)$   or   $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{M/M}}$   (M/M)  and the treatments of sham versus stroke.  $\Nu=19$   for WT sham (4 to 5 cell bodies per animal   $_{\textrm{X4}}$   animals), 18 for M/M sham (4 to 5 cells per animal   $_{\textrm{X4}}$   animals), 30 for WT stroke (4 to  5 cells per animal  $\textrm{x7}$   animals) and 31 for M/M stroke (4,5 cells per animal  $_\textrm{X7}$   animals).  Panels  $\pmb{F}$   and  $G$   show GABAergic in nerva tion of spiny dendrites in layer 1 of cerebral cortex  from WT   $(+/+,F)$   and  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{M/M}}$   (M/M,  G ) 6 months post-stroke animals. Arrowheads  indicate the points where spine heads connect to parent dendritic shafts (Sh). Arrows point  to GABAergic axon terminals in the field, indicated by the HRP-DAB reaction product  reflecting immuno reactivity to GAD. Arrows 1 and 2 show direct contact between  GABAergic terminals and spiny dendrites, while arrows 3, 4 and 5 show GABAergic  

terminals in the plane of section but without contact with the spiny dendrites. All  micrographs were captured at a magnification of  ${20}{,}000{\bf x}$  , which equaled  $49.5\;\upmu\mathrm{m}^{2}.\;H,$    Quant if i cation of the percent of the plasma membrane of spiny dendrites contacted by  GABAergic terminals in this region.  $\Nu=50$   for  $+/+$   sham (10 dendrites per animal  $_{\textrm{X}}5$    animals), 50 for M/M sham (10 dendrites per animal  $_{\textrm{X}}5$   animals), 70 for  $+/+$   stroke (10  dendrites per animal  $\textrm{x7}$   animals) and 70 for M/M stroke (10 dendrites per animal  $_\textrm{X7}$    animals). Panel  I  show a representative medium spiny neuron (MSN) from a WT stroke  striatum receiving GABAergic in nerv at ions. The arrowhead indicates the point where the  spine head connects to its parent dendritic shaft (Sh) that has been pseudo-colored light blue  to enhance visibility of the MSN’s irregular contour within this electron micrograph. Arrows  point to GABAergic terminals in the field, indicated by the HRP-DAB reaction product  reflecting immuno reactivity to GAD. Arrow 1 shows direct contact between a GABAergic  terminal and the MSN while arrow 2 shows a GABAergic terminal in the plane of the  section but without visible contact with the MSN. The electron micrograph was taken at a  magnification of  $30{,}000{\bf x}$  . Panel  $J$   shows quant if i cation of the percent of the plasma  membrane of MSNs contacted by GABAergic terminals in striatum.  $\Nu=50$   for  $+/+$   sham  (10 dendrites per animal  $\textsl{X5}$   animals), 50 for M/M sham (10 dendrites per animal  $_{\textrm{X}}5$    animals), 70 for  $+/+$   stroke (10 dendrites per animal  $\textrm{x7}$   animals) and 70 for M/M stroke (10  dendrites per animal  $\textrm{x7}$   animals). For the assessment of the proportion of layer 5 pyramidal  cell body plasma membrane contacted GABAergic axo-somatic synapse lengths, 5 cell  bodies per brain region per animal were analyzed. To assess the proportion of the plasma  membrane of spiny dendrites in layer 1 and dorsal striatum that were contacted by  GABAergic axon terminals, 10 dendritic profiles were sampled from each brain, using  electron micrographs that were captured at a magnification of   $25{,}000{\bf x}$  .

Figure 6.  

A proposed schematic diagram for the involvement of cortico-striatal pathway for behavioral  adaptation during stroke recovery. The contra lateral cortico-striatal drive favors a direct  pathway in  $\mathrm{\bfBondown}\mathrm{{\bfF}^{M/M}}$  , which contributes to the improved motor function during long-term  recovery. The thickness of lines indicates the strength of the connection (Red arrow,  excitatory glutamate r gic; Blue arrow, inhibitory GABAergic). Compared to WT mice  following stroke,  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice exhibited synaptic changes reflecting decreased inhibition  from inter neurons (d is inhibition, thereby excitation), together with augmented excitatory  syn ap to genesis in layers   $1/2$  , supported by increased TSP2 expression from astrocytes and  increased levels of TSP2 receptor  ${\bf a}2\updelta{-}1$   in layers   $1/2$   of cerebral cortex. In dorsal striatum,  inputs from layer 5 pyramidal neurons form synapses with medium spiny neurons  expressing dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, which partake in the direct and indirect  pathways, respectively. Enhanced excitatory input to dorsal striatum favoring the direct  pathway which then inhibits inhibitory input to thalamus (d is inhibition) could result in  reverberating excitation of the circuit comprised of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop and promote motor/gait function in  $\mathbf{BDNF}^{\mathbf{M}/\mathbf{M}}$   mice. The vent rome dial  thalamus relays input from substantia nigra pars reticulate  55  to cortex, specifically targeting  layer 1  56 . The combined data demonstrated that the layers 1/2 of cortex as the major subregion for synaptic plasticity.
