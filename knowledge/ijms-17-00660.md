Abstract:  We conducted a case-control study investigating the association between the singlenucleotide polymorphism rs2910164 in microRNA (miR)-146a and the risk and prognosis of stroke. We recruited a total of 1139 ischemic stroke patients and 1585 sex- and age-matched control subjects. After a median follow-up period of 4.5 years, 1071 of these ischemic stroke patients were then recruited for a prospective study. Our study revealed that rs2910164 was not associated with ischemic stroke incidence (odds ratio  $=1.00$  ;  $95\%$   conﬁdence interval  $(\mathrm{CI})=0.80-1.24;p=0.985)$   by multivariate logistic regression. Meta-analysis of our case-control study and three others on Asian populations also suggested that there was no relationship between rs2910164 and ischemic stroke incidence. The sign i can ce of differences in long-term outcomes was examined by the log-rank test of the respective comparison groups. The prospective study showed that rs2910164 led to a 1.56-fold increased risk of stroke recurrence (hazard ratio   $(\mathrm{HR})=1.56$  ;  $95\%$   $\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=1.10{-}2.20$  ;  $p=0.013)$  ) and a 2.13-fold increased risk of death caused by cardiovascular disease or stroke (Csdeath)   $(\mathrm{HR}=2.13$  ;  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.31{-}3.46;\,p=0.002)$  ). The independent association of rs2910164 with stroke prognosis was evaluated using Cox regression models. Therefore, rs2910164 appears to be a strong predictor of stroke prognosis but not of stroke incidence in Asian populations.

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke has a limited therapeutic time window and a very high rate of recurrence, and thus is a leading cause of death and constitutes a heavy economic burden in many countries, including China [ 1 – 4 ]. It is a multi factorial disease affected by environmental and genetic risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hyper lipid emi a, and hyper homo cy steinem i a [ 5 , 6 ]. Multiple susceptibility genes have been demonstrated to have a relationship with an enhanced risk of stroke or worse stroke prognosis, including  F5 , angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ), methylene tetra hydro folate reductase ( MTHFR ), serpin peptidase inhibitor 1 ( SERPINE1 ), apo lipoprotein E ( APOE ) [ 7 ], cytochrome P450 2C19 ( CYP2C19 ) [ 8 ], and platelet-derived growth factor D ( PDGF-D ) [ 9 ], as well as chromosome 12p13 variants [ 10 ]. However, the genetic factors identiﬁed cannot fully explain the observed inherited risk of stroke.  

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small,   ${\sim}22.$  -nucleotide non-coding RNAs attached to the   $3^{\prime}$  -untranslated regions of mRNAs through highly conserved seed sequences, and are known to negatively regulate mRNA expression. Genetic alterations in miR sequences impact on precursor process iv it y, maturation, expression, and ultimately inﬂuence the expression of target mRNAs [ 11 – 13 ]. miRNAs are important in biological processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, growth, stress resistance, and metabolism, as well as the path o physiology of neuro degenerative disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease [ 14 – 16 ]. Emerging evidence also indicates that circulating miRNAs may be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of stroke [ 17 , 18 ]. This reﬂects their role in modulating transcriptional programs that affect the processes of atherosclerosis, including endo the li al integrity, in amma tion, and extracellular matrix remodeling [ 19 , 20 ].  

An important and universal type of genetic variation are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [ 21 ], which may affect miRNA function by modulating biogenesis or target selection [ 22 ]. Recently, a well-documented common polymorphism in a pre-miRNA sequence (miR-146a  $C>\mathbf{G}$  (rs2910164; chromosome 5, 160485411)) was found to be involved in a variety of diseases [ 23 – 26 ]. This variant altered the speciﬁc base pairing of the stem region, which inﬂuenced the expression of mature miR-146a [ 27 ]. This binds to target mRNAs including tumor necrosis factor $\propto$   (TNF $\alpha$  ) [ 28 ], C-reactive protein and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1) [ 29 ], which affect vascular damage responses and in amma tion-related atherosclerosis in the development of stroke. However, studies into the relationship between the miR-146a rs2910164 SNP and ischemic stroke in different ethnic populations have provided conﬂicting results.  

To investigate this in greater detail, we designed a case-control study of ischemic stroke patients in a Chinese population and a meta-analysis of four case-control studies into the role of rs2910164 in Asian ischemic stroke patients. A prospective study was also conducted to evaluate the effects of rs2910164 on stroke prognosis.

# 2.1. Baseline Characteristics  

The baseline characteristics of the ischemic stroke patients and control groups are listed in Table  1 . After a follow-up (median time, 4.5 years) of 1071 ischemic stroke patients, a total of 196 recurrent strokes were recorded. The CC, GC, and GG rs2910164 genotype frequencies were   $31.2\%$  ,  $54.3\%$  , and  $14.5\%$   for patients, and   $30.5\%$  ,  $54.8\%$  , and   $14.7\%$   for controls, respectively (Table  2 ). SNP genotype distributions in both groups followed the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).

# 2.2. rs2910164 Is Not Associated with Ischemic Stroke Incidence  

Under the dominant model, the  $\mathrm{GGG}+\mathrm{CG}$   genotype of rs2910164 was not associated with ischemic stroke incidence compared with the CC genotype (  $(\mathrm{OR}=1.00$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.78–1.27,$  ,    $p=0.961)$  ) after adjustment for Model 3. For the cerebral thrombosis subgroup, no association between rs2910164 and ischemic stroke incidence   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.02$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.84–1.24$  ,  $p=0.834)$   after adjustment for Model 3, as was the case for the lacunar infarct subgroup   ${\mathrm{DR}}=0.96,\,95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=0.76{-}1.22,\,p=0.745)$  ) (Table  3 ). The rs2910164 genotype was not connected with the ischemic stroke incidence according to sex after adjustment for Model 2 (Table  4 ).  

Under the recessive model, the rs2910164 GG genotype was not associated with ischemic stroke incidence compared with the   $\mathrm{GC+CC}$   genotype   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.00)$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.80–1.24,$  ,    $p=0.985)$   after adjustment for Model 3. For the cerebral thrombosis subgroup, no association between rs2910164 and ischemic stroke incidence (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.99$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.77.$  –1.28,  $p=0.950)$   after adjustment for Model 3, as was the case for the lacunar infarct subgroup   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.02$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.75–1.38,$  ,  $p=0.922,$  ) (Table  3 ). The rs2910164 genotype was not associated with the ischemic stroke incidence according to sex after adjustment for Model 2 (Table  4 ).  

# 2.3. Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between rs2910164 and Ischemic Stroke Incidence  

A forest plot was constructed from the ﬁndings of four studies showing the relationship between rs2910164 and ischemic stroke in Asian populations under the dominant model (genotype   $(\mathrm{GC}+\mathrm{CG})$  vs.  CC) (Figure  1 ). This suggested that rs2910164 does not affect the ischemic stroke incidence  $(\mathrm{OR}=1.01\$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.90–1$  .14).  

# 2.4. rs2910164 Is a Strong Predictor of Stroke Prognosis  

This prospective study showed that the rs2910164 GG genotype notably increased the risk of stroke recurrence (Figure  2 a,  $p=0.016\$  ). Kaplan–Meier estimates of the cumulative recurrence-free probability in ischemic stroke patients based on the C allele of rs2910164 polymorphism were: log–rank statistic  $\chi^{2}=5.796$  ;    $p=0.016$  . Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated that the GG genotype had a 1.56-fold increased risk for recurrence (Table  5 ,  $\mathrm{HR}=1.56$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.10{-}2.20$  ,    $p=0.013)$  ) after adjusting for Model 3. Additionally, the GG genotype sign i cant ly increased the risk of death caused by cardiovascular disease or stroke (Csdeath) (Figure    $^{2\flat}$  ,    $p=0.002)$  ). Kaplan–Meier estimates of the cumulative event-free survival probability in ischemic stroke patients based on the C allele of rs2910164 polymorphism were: log-rank statistic    $\chi^{2}=9.155,\,p=0.002$  . The analysis of Cox proportional hazards showed that the GG genotype had a 2.13-fold increased risk for Csdeath (Table  5 ,   $\mathrm{HR}=2.13.$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.31{-}3.46,\,p=0.002)$   after adjusting for Model 3.

# 3. Discussion  

In this study, we investigated the association of the miR-146a rs2910164 SNP with stroke incidence and prognosis. Our large-scale prospective investigation showed that rs2910164 was associated with a 1.56-fold increased risk of stroke recurrence and a 2.13-fold increased risk of Csdeath in a Chinese population. However, we observed no association with ischemic stroke incidence. To the best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time we found the association between rs2910164 with ischemic stroke prognosis.  

There are a number of possible mechanisms to explain why rs2910164 is a signiﬁcant predictor of stroke prognosis. rs2910164 involves a C-to-G nucleotide substitution, which can cause a C:U pair change to a G:U mismatch in the stem structure of the miR-146a precursor, and therefore decreases the expression of mature miR-146a. miR-146a regulates a pathway and it can accelerate the binding of the transcriptional repressor RelB to the  TNF-  $\cdot\alpha$   promoter [ 28 ]. miR-146a primarily targets  IRAK1 and  TRAF6 , resulting in the inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-  $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$   via the Toll-like receptor pathway [ 29 ]. Therefore, the down-regulation of miR-146a may increase in amma tion-related atherosclerosis and affect vascular damage response by increasing the levels of TNF $\alpha,$  , TRAF6, and IRAK1. Over expression of miR-146a in peripheral blood mono nuclear cells activates Th1 cells and induces the expression of TNF $^{.}{\alpha},$   monocyte che mo tactic protein 1, NF $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$  , and  $\mathsf{p65}$   through post-transcriptional enhancement of the T-bet pathway [ 30 ].  

Previously, rs2910164 was sign i cant ly associated with ischemic stroke prevalence and increased stroke risk in female, nor moten sive, and non diabetic groups in a South Korean population [ 31 ]. However, we found no association between rs2910164 and ischemic stroke incidence. A previous investigation by Zhu  et al.  observed that rs2910164 had a protective role against the incidence of large-artery at hero sclerotic stroke in the northern Chinese Han population [ 32 ], although Liu  et al. failed to ﬁnd any relationship between rs2910164 and ischemic stroke [ 33 ]. These different ﬁndings could reﬂect ethnic variations and limitations of sample sizes, but most important, the sex, subtype of stroke may contribute a lot to this. For this reason, we have analyzed the association between rs2910164 and ischemic stroke incidence based on stroke subtype and sex, and we conducted a meta-analysis of the four above mentioned studies, but the result showed no relationship between rs2910164 and ischemic stroke incidence.  

The current study has a number of limitations. Although the sample size was relatively large, a larger patient population involving other ethnicities should be included. Additionally, in our meta-analysis, the absence of original data restricted us to further evaluate gene–gene and gene-environment interactions. Independent genetic studies should also be performed to detect levels of mature miR-146a and to elucidate novel target genes and regulatory molecules. In addition, we performed analyses for several genetic models, namely, dominant, recessive, codominant, and additive ones; the results showed that the dominant model and recessive model are the most appropriate.  

# 4. Materials and Methods  

# 4.1. Study Population  

Patients in the case-control study were recruited from among participants of the previously described Multi center Chinese Stroke Study [ 34 ]. Between November 2000 and November 2001, we consecutively recruited 1139 ischemic stroke patients from seven clinical centers (Beijing, Tianjin Yanzhou, Xi’an, Wuhan Xiehe, Wuhan Tongji, and Chongqing, China) together with 1585 age- and sex-matched control subjects. To minimize phenotypic heterogeneity, we recruited patients with only one of the two subtypes of ischemic stroke (cerebral thrombosis and lacunar infarct).  

We used neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) to conﬁrm stroke, in strict accordance with the criteria of the International Class i cation of Diseases (9th revision). It was deﬁned as a sudden onset of non convulsive and focal neurological deﬁcits persisting for  ${>}24\;\mathrm{h}$  . We excluded patients who had other kinds of stroke: sub ara ch noid hemorrhage, cerebro vascular malformation, embolic brain infarction, brain tumors, and transient ischemic attack, and other co morbidity diseases such as: in amma tion, collagen os is, liver, metabolic disease, tumorous, or renal disease.  

Our investigations were conducted consistent with the rules of the Declaration of Helsinki, and identiﬁed by the ethics committee and institutional review board of Fuwai Hospital. All participants were given written informed consent.  

# 4.2. Follow-up and Outcome Assessment in a Prospective Study  

Of the 1139 ischemic stroke patients, 1071 were recruited after an average 4.5 years of follow-up until 2006 by physicians through the administration of a standard questionnaire and telephone contact. Endpoints included stroke recurrence and Csdeath. Recurrent stroke was deﬁned as a new-onset acute new focal neurological deﬁcit without obvious cause other than vascular disease origin after stroke or an acute aggravation of the existing focal neurological deﬁcit without obvious cause other than vascular disease which was occurring at least 21 days after the ﬁrst stroke [ 35 ]. Deaths were reported by family members. No signiﬁcant differences in the frequency of genotypes and clinical parameters of patients were found between those who were followed up and those who were lost to follow-up. The event-free group comprised those patients who had no events and were unable to be followed up completely.  

# 4.3. Measurements of Biochemical Parameters and Collection of Clinical Data  

Routine clinical interviews were conducted to ascertain each patient’s history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and alcohol intake. The   $\mathrm{12–h}$   overnight fasting blood of these patients were collected. In patients with acute medical events, we delayed the collection of blood samples by six weeks. Plasma was separated by cent ri fuga tion and the white blood cell buffy coat was stored at    $-80\ ^{\circ}\mathbf{C}.$  . Biochemical variables, including total plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and blood glucose, were determined by an automatic Hitachi 7060 chemistry analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).  

# 4.4. Genotyping Variants of rs2910164  

Ligase detection reaction (LDR) was used to genotype rs2910164 variants (Shanghai Biowing Applied Biotechnology Co., Ltd: Shanghai, China). Primer or probe sequences and PCR or LDR product lengths of the variants are listed in Table  6 . Fragment was ampliﬁed in   ${20}{\mathrm{-}}{\upmu\mathrm{L}}$   multiplex PCR reaction mixtures including  $50\;\mathrm{ng}$     $(1~\upmu\mathrm{L})$   of genomic DNA,  $2~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of   ${\mathrm{dNTPs}},2~\ensuremath{\upmu\mathrm{L}}$   of   $1\times$   buffer,

  $0.6~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of  $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$  ,  $0.2\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of Taq polymerase,  $4\;\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of  $1\times Q$  -solution,  $0.4\;\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of primer mix, and   $9.8\;\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of

  $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O,}$   using the thermal cycler Gene Amp PCR system 9600 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Further amp li cation was conducted in  $10{\mathrm{-}}\upmu\mathrm{L}$   multiplex LDR reaction mixtures containing   $100\,\mathrm{ng}$   of original PCR product   $(1\;\upmu\mathrm{L})$  ,  $0.05\;\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of NEB Taq DNA ligase ,  $.1\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of probe mix, and  $6.95~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of   $\mathrm{{d}d H_{2}O,}$  using the ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer detected and GeneMapper software (ABI) analyzed.

# 4.5. Statistical Analysis  

The  $x^{2}$    test was performed to test genotype and allele frequencies, qualitative variables, and HWE. Multivariable logistic regression model was conducted to evaluate associations between rs2910164 and stroke incidence. In the prospective study, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to describe the association between rs2910164 and stroke recurrence and prognosis. The unadjusted hazard ration was shown in Model 1. In Model 2, age and sex were adjusted, and age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, and alcohol intake were adjusted in Model 3. Two-tailed  $p<0.05$   was considered signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS software, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  

# 4.6. Meta-Analysis  

A meta-analysis of four studies on the role of rs2910164 in ischemic stroke, including our case-control study, two other studies in Chinese populations, and one in a South Korean population, was performed (Table  7 ). A total of 2481 ischemic stroke patients and 2910 controls were analyzed. Literature was searched in PubMed and EMBASE databases, using the following retrieval strategy: miR-146a AND polymorphisms AND stroke incidence. The inclusion criteria are as followed: (1) the association between the miR146a rs2910164 polymorphism and ischemic stroke are case-control studies; (2) containing original data; and (3) following HWE. Exclusion criteria were: (1) study design other than case-control; (2) not reporting genotypic and allelic frequencies; and (3) family members studied based on linkage considerations. Two investigators discussed to resolve the disagreements between them. We calculated odds ratio (OR),  $95\%$   conﬁdence interval   $(95\%$   CI) through the ﬁxed effects model or Der Simoni an–Laird and random effects model to describe the relationship between rs2910164 and stroke incidence. Statistical analysis was carried out using Stata (9th edition; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) and RevMan (5th edition) software.

Heterogeneity:  $\chi^{2}=5.67$  ,  $p=0.129$  ,    $I^{2}=47.1\%$  .  

# 5. Conclusions  

We found that rs2910164 increased the risk of stroke recurrence and Csdeath in a Chinese population but did not predict stroke incidence in Asian populations, suggesting that it has the potential to be a target for therapeutic interventions that aim to reduce in amma tion and improve stroke outcome.
