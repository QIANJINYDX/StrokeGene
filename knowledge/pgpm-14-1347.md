Purpose:  The current study aimed to investigate in an Armenian population the levels of  pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) of lectin complement pathway (LCP), MBL (mannan-binding lectin) and M-ficolin in plasma in ischemic stroke (IS), and the possible association  of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in  MBL2, FCN1  and  FCN2  genes.  

Patients and Methods:  A total of 122 patients with IS and 150 control subjects were  included in this study. Immuno flu oro metric assays (TRIFMAs) and real-time polymerase  chain reactions with  TaqMan  probes were conducted.  

Results:  According to the results, the levels of M-ficolin in IS patients are significantly  higher than in control subjects, and the  MBL2  rs11003125 and rs12780112 SNPs, as well as  MBL2  rs  $12780112^{*}\mathrm{T}$   and  FCN1  rs  $\mathrm{:}10120023^{*}\mathrm{T}$   minor alleles (MAs) are negatively asso­ ciated with the risk of IS. Further,  MBL2  rs11003125 and rs1800450 SNPs and the carriage  of their MAs, as well as  $F C N I{\mathrm{~rs}}2989727{\mathrm{~SNR}}$   and the carriage of  FCN1  rs1  $0120023^{*}\mathrm{T}$   MA  significantly alter plasma MBL and M-ficolin levels in IS patients, respectively. Five  common haplotypes in  MBL2  gene and three common haplotypes in  FCN1  and  FCN2  genes were revealed, among which CGTC was negatively associated with IS and decreasing  MBL plasma levels in IS.  

Conclusion:  In conclusion, we suggest that LCP PRMs are associated with the risk of  developing IS, and may also participate in pathological events leading to post-ischemic brain  damage. This study emphasizes the important contribution of alterations of LCP PRMs on  genomic and proteomic levels to the path o mechanisms of ischemic stroke, at least in an  Armenian population.

# Introduction  

Annually, nearly 6 million people die and another 5 million are left permanently  disabled from strokes. The global burden of this disease, measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) almost doubled during the last two decades and will reach  61 million DALYs in 2020, accounting for   $6.2\%$   of the total burden of illness in 2020. In the US alone, the total annual cost of stroke is estimated at  $\S65.5$   billion, including  both direct and indirect costs. While stroke incidence rates either have decreased or  remained the same during the last several years in developing countries, an increase  , has been recorded in low and middle income countries. In Armenia, stroke is the  second leading cause of death after heart disease, accounting for  $21.6\%$   of all deaths.  Thus, in the Armenian population, the prevalence and incidence of stroke was 19,572  and 5782 in 2019, resulting in rates of 828.4 and 244.7 per 100,000 population.  

One of the key pathological processes underlying tis­ sue damage and hence the severity and outcome of  ischemic stroke is the inflammatory response, including  activation of the complement system. The activation pro­ ducts of the complement system contribute to the produc­ tion of inflammatory mediators, and can therefore promote  tissue injury at sites of inflammation. ,  

The lectin complement pathway (LCP) is activated in  the absence of immune complexes. In humans LCP con­ sists of: (1) five pattern recognition molecules (PRMs): the  two C-type lectins, mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and CL-LK (he te rome ric complex of native collectin kidney 1  (CL-K1) and collectin liver 1 (CL-L1)), M-ficolin,  L-ficolin and H-ficolin; (2) three MASPs (MBL-associated  serine proteases): MASP-1, MASP-2 and MASP-3; and 

 (3) two MBL-associated non-enzymatic proteins: MAp19 

 (MBL-associated protein of   $19\ \mathrm{kDa})$   and MAp44 (MBL-associated protein of   $44~\mathrm{kDa}$  ).  

In recent studies LCP was found to be involved in  ischemic stroke. Particularly, the results indicated that the  activities of MASP-1 and MASP-2 are elevated in the  blood of ischemic stroke patients compared with control  , subjects. Moreover, we found that the rs3203210 and  rs28945073 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in  the  MASP1  gene and the rs 147270785 SNP in  MASP2  are strongly associated with ischemic stroke.  

Initially, the humoral PMRs were described to react  with patterns on the surface of microorganisms and  viruses, but later a number of studies indicated that they  also react with ischemia-conditioned blood vessels and  tissues. The studies on animal models of ischemia/  reperfusion showed that upon restoration of blood supply  PRMs become capable of reacting with damaged brain  endo the li al cells, thereby initiating an inflammation-like  reaction, resulting in tissue destruction. Consistent with  this, previous studies found better recovery of brain func­ tions in ischemic stroke patients with low levels of MBL  than in patients with normal MBL levels, and also that  knock-out of the two MBL-genes in mice protected against  post-ischemic brain damage.  

It has been shown that the alterations in the MBL,  M-ficolin and L-ficolin levels are associated with variations  found in their genes. Interestingly, for the  MBL2  gene, which  in total is composed of 7461 nucleotides, 2072 SNPs have  been registered in the NCBI database, from which 265 are  coding SNPs. However, a large number of studies showed  that among all these SNPs only six show strong influence on  the levels of MBL in serum (  $-550\ \mathrm{H{>}L}$   rs11003125,  $-221$   $\mathrm{X{>}Y}$   rs7096206,   $+4\mathrm{~P{>}Q}$   rs12780112, 52   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{D}$   rs5030737,  54   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{B}$   rs1800450 and 57   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{C}$   rs1800451). , Regarding the  FCN1  and  FCN2  genes, which are composed  of 8379 and 7271 nucleotides, 4645 and 2488 SNPs have  been registered in the NCBI database, from which 327 and  394 are coding SNPs ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ ).  Among these SNPs only a few have been found to influence  the protein levels, including   $-542\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\textrm{C}\!>\!T}}$   rs10120023 and 

  $-1981\ \mathrm{C{>}T}$   rs2989727 SNPs in  FCN1  gene 36 , and   $-986$   $_\mathrm{A>G}$   rs3124952,   $-602\ \mathrm{\GeV}$   rs3124953 and −4   $_\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$  rs17514136 in  FCN2  gene. ,  

The aim of the current study was to investigate the  levels of two PRMs of the LCP in plasma, MBL and  M-ficolin, in ischemic stroke, as well as the possible  association of this pathology in an Armenian population  with 11 genetic polymorphisms, i.e. (1) the six genes  encoding MBL:  MBL2   $-550\ \ \mathrm{H{>}L}$   rs11003125,   $-221$   $\mathrm{X{>}Y}$    rs7096206,   $+4$     $\mathrm{P{>}Q}$    rs12780112,  52   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{D}$  rs5030737,   $54\mathrm{\A^{>}B}$   rs1800450 and   $57\mathrm{\A}{>}\mathrm{C}$   rs1800451);  (2) two encoding M-ficolin:  FCN1   $^{-542}\,\mathrm{C}^{>\mathrm{T}}$   rs10120023  and −1981   $\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}$   rs2989727) and (3) three encoding  L-ficolin:  FCN2  (−986   $_\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   rs3124952,   $-602$     $\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  rs3124953 and   ${\mathrm{-}}4\mathrm{~}\mathrm{A}{>}\mathrm{G}$   rs17514136).  

# Materials and Methods Study Population  

A total of 122 patients with first-episode ischemic stroke  (mean ag  $\mathbf{\mathfrak{e}}\pm\mathbf{\mathfrak{S}}\mathbf{D}$  :   $70.6\pm\:10.4$   years, females/males: 61/69)  and 150 control subjects (CS; mean age  $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$  :   $68.7\pm10.0$  years, females/ males: 77/73) were enrolled in this study. All  subjects were unrelated Caucasians of Armenian ancestry.  Patients were recruited among those whose stroke occurred  within the prior 12 hours, and were consecutively admitted to  the Emergency Departments of Medical Centers of the  Ministry of Health of the Republic of Armenia.  

Diagnosis of ischemic stroke was based on neurological  examination and clinical history confirmed by computer  tomography imaging of the brain and standard laboratory  analyses. The TOAST definitions were used to assess the  stroke subtype. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale  (NIHSS) was applied to define the severity of neurological  deficit. The exclusion criteria for patients’ group were  tumor, brain trauma or cerebral hemorrhage, as well as  lacunar stroke syndromes, and the inclusion criteria were  card i oem boli c stroke   $\mathbf{(n}=22)$  ) and large vessel a the roth rom­ boembolic stroke   $(\mathsf{n}=100)$  ), with moderate to severe impair­ ment (NIHSS score between 15–19).  

Control subjects were blood donors of the Blood Bank  of Hae mat ology Center after Prof. R. Yeolyan. The inclu­ sion criteria for control subjects’ group were no personal  or family history of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke  and/or any other cerebro vascular or cardiovascular dis­ eases. All subjects or their legal representatives gave  their informed consent to participate in the study. The  study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the  Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA (IRB #00004079).  

# Blood Collection and Extraction of  Plasma and DNA Samples  

Morning fasting blood samples were collected by veni­ puncture in EDTA-containing tubes and kept on ice for 60  min. Next, they were centrifuged at   $3000{\mathrm{~g~}}$   for   $15~\mathrm{min}$   at   $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The obtained plasma samples were stored in aliquots  at   $-30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until further use. To remove any precipitate, the  plasma samples were thawed and centrifuged at 10,000  rpm for   $5~\mathrm{min}$   at   $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   immediately prior to use.  

Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples  41  according to a standard phenol-chloroform method and  stored at   $-30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until further use.  

# Assessment of MBL and M-Ficolin Levels  in Plasma  

The levels of MBL and M-ficolin were determined by in-house time-resolved immuno flu oro metric assay (TRIFMA)  where MBL and M-ficolin bound onto the antibody-coated  surface of the wells were detected with bio tiny late d second  antibody and europium-labelled strep t avid in instead of  enzyme-labeled antibody as used in conventional sandwich  , immune assays. In brief: for assessment of MBL levels  microtiter wells were coated with   $1~\upmu\mathrm{g}$   mannan in   $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$  bicarbonate,  $\mathrm{pH}\,9.6$  . The residual binding sites were blocked  with human serum albumin and washed with TBS/Tween/   $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$    buffer before incubating overnight at  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   with   $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$  plasma samples (diluted four-fold in Tris buffer containing 1   $\mathrm{M\N{a}C l}$   and   $5\;\mathrm{{mM}\;\mathrm{{CaCl}}_{2}}$  ). After washing with   $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$  - con­ taining buffer the wells were incubated with 1 ng bio tiny late d  anti-MBL antibody and next with   $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   Eu-labeled-strep­ tavidin (Perkin Elmer 1244–360; freshly diluted 1/1000 in  Tris/TBS buffer with   $25~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   EDTA). After washing with  TBS/T  $\mathrm{Moen/CaCl_{2}\ 200\ \upmu L}$   of Enhancement buffer (Perkin  Elmer) was added. After  $5\;\mathrm{min}$   on a plate shaker the fluores­ cence was read by time-resolved flu o rome try (DELFIA-reader, Perkin Elmer). For internal control, standard plasma   $(3.6~\upmu\mathrm{g}~\mathrm{MBL}/\mathrm{mL})$   as well as three plasma samples of high,  medium and low MBL concentrations were analyzed on  every microtiter plate.  

The assessment of plasma M-ficolin levels was per­ formed in the same way but using coating with mouse  anti-human M-ficolin (clone 7G1) in   $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   PBS, with  TBS/Tween for all washing steps. Secondary antibody was   $25~\mathrm{ng}$   bio tiny late d 7G1 anti-M-ficolin.  

# Genotyping Analysis  

The patients with ischemic stroke and the control subjects  were genotyped for 11 SNPs: 6 SNPs within the  MBL2  gene (  $-550\ \mathrm{H{>}L}$   rs11003125,   $-221$     $\mathrm{X{>}Y}$   rs7096206,   $+4$   $\mathrm{P{>}Q}$   rs12780112,   $52\mathrm{\A^{>}D}$   rs5030737,   $54\mathrm{\A^{>}B}$   rs1800450  and   $57\,\mathrm{\AA^{>}C}$   rs1800451), 2 SNPs in  FCN1  gene   $(-542$   $\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}$   rs10120023 and  $-1981~\mathrm{C{>}T\ r s2989727)}$  , and 3 SNPs  in  FCN2  gene   $(-986\mathrm{~~A>G}$   rs3124952,   $-602$     $\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  rs3124953 and   $-4\mathrm{\\A>G}$   rs17514136). The genotyping  was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction  (RT-PCR) using  TaqMan  genotyping system, minor-groove-binder (MGB)  TaqMan  probes from Applied  Biosystems (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA) and Sequence  Detection System (SDS) software (version 2.3) for the  detection of end-point fluorescence. A non-template  control (NTC) was introduced within each set of assays.  The selection of SNPs ( Table 1 ) was based on the pre­ viously described functional effect on the levels of studied  molecules in the general population. , , , , Among  the selected SNPs, 7 are in regulatory regions   $5^{\prime}$   near  gene. The primers were commercially labeled with 6-car­ boxy-fluoresce in (FAM) or VIC fluorescent dyes. The  sequences of the primers and probes used in the genotyp­ ing analysis are presented in  Table 2 .  

For PCR reactions a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler  (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA) was used. The PCR reaction  mixes contained   $20~\mathrm{{ng}}$   DNA,   $900\ \mathrm{nM}$   primers, and 200  nM probes, as well as  TaqMan  Universal PCR Master Mix  (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in a final  volume of   $5~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   in 384-well plates. The PCR profiling  included 2 minat   $50~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ,   $10\ \mathrm{min}$   at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , followed by 40  cycles of   $15\mathrm{~s~}$   at   $95\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and   $1\ \mathrm{min}$   at an annealing tem­ perature of   $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The endpoint reading of the fluores­ cence generated during PCR amplification was carried out  on the real-time PCR instrument ABI Prism 7900 (Applied  Biosystems). Genotype assignments were obtained with  the SDS software mentioned above.  

The distribution of the genotypes for the selected SNPs  was checked for correspondence to Hardy–Weinberg equi­  $\chi^{2}$    librium (HWE) using the Pearson  test. To reveal the

potential association of the studied SNPs with ischemic  stroke, genotype, phenotype and minor allele frequencies  (MAFs), as well as carriage rates in patients and control  subjects were compared. The significance of differences  between study groups in multiplicative, dominant and  recessive models was determined using the Fisher’s exact  test. With regard to the additive model, the differences in  genotype distribution of the polymorphisms between case  and control subjects were tested by logistic regression. The  odds ratio (OR),   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI), and   $P$  values were calculated. The Mann–Whitney U (quantita­ tive variables) and Fisher’s exact tests (nominal and ordi­ nal variables) were used to evaluate the possible  differences of the clinical characteristics between minor  allele carrier and non-carriers in the group of ischemic  stroke patients. The data are presented as box plots indi­ cating 25th–75th percentiles, median and minimum and  maximum values. Linkage d is equilibrium (LD) analysis  and haplotype-based case–control study were carried out  using SNP Analyse r 2.0 software 48  and the expectation  maximization algorithm. LD blocks were defined accord­ ing to the haplotype block definition of Gabriel, which  defines pairs to be in strong LD if the one-sided upper   $95\%$   confidence bound on  $D^{\prime}$   is  ${\tt>}0.98$   and the lower bound  is above   $0.7.^{49}\ P$    values less than 0.05 were considered  statistically significant.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software  package version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The  comparisons of the levels of MBL and M-ficolin in plasma  between the groups, as well as between the different  genotypes of the studied SNPs in  MBL2  and  FCN1  genes  within the groups were performed using non parametric  Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis   $H\cdot$  -tests, respectively.  Data are represented as mean  $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$  .  

# Results The Levels of MBL and M-Ficolin in  Plasma of Patients and Controls  

MBL and M-ficolin levels in blood of patients with stroke  and control subjects were estimated. The results obtained  for MBL ( Figure 1A ) showed no significant differences  between the levels in ischemic stroke patients   $({\mathrm{mean}}\pm{\mathrm{SD}}$  : 

  $2.10\pm1.88~\upmu\mathrm{g/mL})$  ) and control subjects   $(\mathrm{mean}\pm\mathrm{SD}\colon2.03$   $\pm\ \ 1.78\ \ \upmu\mathrm{g/mL})$  ). In contrast, the levels of M-ficolin 

 ( Figure 1B ) were 1.4 times higher in the ischemic stroke  patients (mean  $\pm$   SD:   $2.60\,\pm\,1.15~\upmu\mathrm{g/mL}$  ) compared with  control subjects (mean  $\pm$  SD:   $1.88\pm0.63~\upmu\mathrm{g/mL})$  ).  

# Genotyping of MBL2, FCN1 and FCN2  Genes in the Two Cohorts  

The assessment of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium of the stu­ died 11 SNPs showed that in both the ischemic stroke  patients and in the control subjects the genotype distribution  of the 7 SNPs ( FCN1  gene rs2989727,  FCN2  gene  rs3124952, rs3124953 and rs17514136, as well as  MBL2  gene rs7096206 (X/Y), rs5030737 (A/D) and rs1800450  (A/B)) were concordant with the Hardy-Weinberg equili­ brium   $_{(P>0.05)}$  . In contrast, the genotype distributions of 4  SNPs ( FCN1  gene rs10120023 and  MBL2  gene rs12780112   $\left(\mathrm{P}/\mathrm{Q}\right)$   in the group of ischemic stroke patients, and  FCN1  gene rs10120023,  MBL2  gene rs11003125 (H/L) and

Figure 1  Levels of MBL ( A ) and M-ficolin ( B ) in the plasma of ischemic stroke patients (IS;  $\mathsf{n}=122$  ) and control subjects (CS;  $\mathsf{n}=150)$  ).  

rs1800451 (A/C) in the group of control subjects do not  comply with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium   $(P{<}0.05)$  ( Supplementary Table 1 ).  

According to the genotyping data for the rs11003125 

 (H/L) SNP in  MBL2  there were statistically significant  differences in the frequencies of the GG, GC and CC  genotypes between ischemic stroke patients and control  subjects ( Table 3 ). In addition, the frequency of its C  minor allele was 1.7 times lower in ischemic stroke  patients in comparison with control subjects, when con­ sidering the multiplicative model. Further, the additive  model of the effect of the rs12780112 (P/Q) SNP showed  that there were statistically significant differences in the  frequencies of CC, CT and TT genotypes between patients  and control subjects ( Table 3 ).  

An association of  FCN1  rs10120023 with ischemic  stroke under the recessive model was also observed  ( Table 3 ). The TT genotype frequency in control subjects  was significantly (2.33 times) increased compared with  ischemic stroke patients ( Table 3 ).  

No association with the risk of ischemic stroke was  observed with regard to the remaining SNPs (rs1800450 

 (A/B), rs1800451 (A/C), rs5030737 (A/D) and rs7096206 

 (X/Y) in  MBL2  gene; rs2989727 in  FCN1  gene;  rs3124952, rs3124953 and rs17514136 in  FCN2  gene).  

# Association Between SNPs in MBL2 and  FCN1 Genes with Levels of MBL and  M-Ficolin in Plasma  

Kruskal–Wallis   $H\cdot$  -test was applied to assess the possible  association between the genotypes of the SNPs in  MBL2  and  FCN1  genes and the plasma levels of MBL and  M-ficolin ( Figures 2  and  3 ).  

Statistically significant associations of the plasma levels of  MBL were found (1) in ischemic stroke patients with SNPs of  the  MBL2  gene (rs11003125 (  $\mathrm{^{H/L}}$  ,  $P=0.001]$  ) and rs1800450  (A/B,   $P<\!\!0.0001$  ; (2) in control subjects with SNPs of the  rs11003125   $\mathrm{(H/L}$  ,  $P=0.005)$  ), rs12780112 (P/Q,  ${\cal P}\!<\!0.0001\big>$  ),  rs5030737 (A/D,  $P\,{=}\,0.047)$  ) and rs1800450 (A/B,  ${\cal P}\!<\!0.0001\big>$  );  (3) in the whole sample between SNPs of the rs11003125   $\mathrm{(H/\Omega)}$  L,  ${\cal P}\!<\!0.0001\rangle$  ), rs12780112   $\mathrm{{P}/{Q}},$  ,  ${\cal P}\!<\!0.0001)$  ), rs5030737   $\mathrm{(A/}$  D  $\jmath,P\!=\!0.029)$  ), rs1800450 (A/B,  ${\cal P}\!<\!0.0001\rangle$  ) and rs1800451 (A/   $C,P\!=\!0.032)$  ) ( Figure 2 ). Moreover, all these SNPs had diverse  effects on the MBL plasma levels. Thus, the minor alleles of  the rs11003125 (H/L) and rs12780112   $(\mathrm{P}/\mathrm{Q})$   SNPs were asso­ ciated with the allelic dose-response increase of the MBL  plasma levels ( Figure 2A  and  C ), and the minor alleles of  the rs5030737 (A/D), rs1800450 (A/B) and rs1800451 (A/C)  SNPs were associated with the allelic dose-response decrease  of the MBL plasma levels ( Figure 2D – F ).  

Regarding M-ficolin, statistically significant associa­ tions with its plasma levels were observed between the  genotype of the rs2989727 SNP   $\left(P=0.023\right)$  ) of the  FCN1  gene in ischemic stroke patients, between the genotype of  the rs10120023 SNP   $\textstyle P=0.019$  ) in control subjects, as  well as between the SNPs of rs10120023 and rs2989727   $P=0.001$   and   $P=0.032$  , respectively) in the entire study  population ( Figure 3 ). Thus, the minor allele of the  rs10120023 SNP was associated with the allelic dose-response increase of the M-ficolin plasma levels  ( Figure 3A ), and the minor allele of the rs2989727 SNP  is associated with the allelic dose-response decrease of the  M-ficolin plasma levels ( Figure 3B ).  

The study of the possible association of the minor allele  carriage rates of the rs11003125 (H/L), rs7096206 (X/Y),  rs12780112 (P/Q), rs5030737 (A/D), rs1800450 (A/B) and  rs1800451 (A/C) SNPs in the  MBL2  gene and the levels of  MBL in plasma in the entire study population, in ischemic  stroke patients and in control subjects showed that the carriage  of the minor C allele of the rs11003125 (H/L) SNP was  associated with the significant increase in the MBL plasma  levels ( Figure 4A ) in the entire study population   $(P{<}0.0001)$  ),  in ischemic stroke patients   $\left.P=0.001\right\}$  ) and in control subjects   $(P\,=\,0.022)$  ). The carriage of the minor G allele of the  rs7096206 (X/Y) SNP was associated with the significant  decrease in the MBL plasma levels ( Figure 4B ) in control  subjects   $\ P=0.038)$  ). The carriage of the minor T allele of the  rs12780112   $(\mathrm{P}/\mathrm{Q})$   SNP was associated with the significant  increase in the MBL plasma levels ( Figure 4C ) in the entire  population   $(P\!<\!\!0.0001)$   and control subjects (  ${\cal P}\!<\!0.0001)$  ). The  carriage of the minor T allele of the rs5030737 (A/D) SNP was  associated with the significant decrease in the MBL plasma  levels ( Figure 4D ) in the entire population   $(P\!<\!\!0.0001)$   and in  control subjects   ${\cal P}\prec0.0001)$  ). The carriage of the minor A  allele of the rs1800450 (A/B) SNP is associated with the  significant decrease in the MBL plasma levels ( Figure 4E ) in  all studied groups   $(P\!<\!\!0.0001)$  ). And the carriage of the minor  A allele of the rs1800451 (A/C) SNP is associated with the  significant decrease in the MBL plasma levels ( Figure 4F ) in  the entire population   $(P=0.01)$  ) and control subjects   $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}}=$  0.039). Although no statistically significant associations were  found for carriage of the minor alleles of these SNPs for other  groups, the profiles of their effect on the MBL plasma levels  remain the same in all cases, except the reverse effect of the

The study of the possible association of the minor allele  carriage rates of the rs10120023 and rs2989727 in the  FCN1  gene and the plasma levels of M-ficolin in the entire study  population, ischemic stroke patients and control subjects  showed that the carriage of the minor   $\mathrm{T}$   allele of the  rs10120023 is associated with the significant increase in the  M-ficolin plasma levels ( Figure 5A ) in the entire study popu­ lation   $\textstyle P=0.002\$  ) and in the ischemic stroke patients   $P=$  0.04), and the carriage of the minor T allele of the rs2989727  is associated with the significant decrease in the M-ficolin  plasma levels ( Figure 5B ) in the entire study population   $\scriptstyle(P\,=$  0.036) and in control subjects   $(P=0.045)$  . As in case of  MBL2 , although no statistically significant associations were  found for carriage of the minor alleles of these SNPs for other  groups, the profiles of their effect on the M-ficolin plasma  levels remain the same in all cases ( Figure 5 ).  

# LD Analysis Between Studied SNPs  

The patterns of LD among the selected SNPs in  MBL2  gene   $\mathrm{r}^{2}$    estimated using pairwise measures of ID’I and are shown  in  Supplementary Table 2  and  Figure 6A . According to the  results obtained a strong linkage was revealed between 4  SNPs of  MBL2  gene, rs11003125 (H/L), rs7096206 (X/Y),  rs12780112 (P/Q) and rs5030737 (A/D). Thus, the LD plots  in  Figure 6A  indicate a common one-block structure in each  group, ischemic stroke patients (IS) and control subjects  (CS), by D’ for  MBL2 .  

The patterns of LD among the selected SNPs in  FCN1  and  FCN2  genes are shown in  Supplementary Table 3  and  Figure 6B , indicating the presence of two blocks both in  patients and control subjects. One LD block is formed by  the two SNPs in  FCN1  gene, rs10120023 and rs2989727,  and the other is formed by 3 SNPs in  FCN2  gene,  rs3124952, rs3124953, rs17514136 SNPs spanning,  respectively.

# Haplotype Analysis of SNPs in MBL2,  FCN1 and FCN2 Genes with Ischemic  Stroke  

The haplotype analysis of the studied SNPs in  MBL2  gene  revealed five common haplotypes, which include rs11003125  (H/L), rs7096206 (X/Y), rs12780112 (P/Q) and rs5030737 (A/  D) SNPs. The CGTC (HYPD) haplotype was negatively  associated with ischemic stroke   $\textstyle P=0.07$  ,  Table 4A ).  

The haplotype analysis of the studied SNPs in  FCN1  and  FCN2  genes revealed three common haplotypes with a  frequency of   ${>}5\%$   in  FCN1  gene ( Table 4B ), and three  haplotypes for SNPs in  FCN2  gene ( Table 4C ). However,  none of these defined haplotypes showed association with  ischemic stroke.  

# Association of Revealed Haplotypes in  MBL2 and FCN1 Genes with the Levels  of MBL and M-Ficolin in Plasma in  Ischemic Stroke Patients and Control  Subjects  

We analyzed the relation between observed GGCC  (HYPA),  CCCC  (LYPA),  CGCC  (LXPA),  CGTC  (LYQA) and GGCT (HYPD) haplotypes between the  rs11003125 (H/L), rs7096206 (X/Y), rs12780112 (P/Q)  and rs5030737 (A/D) SNPs in  MBL2  gene with MBL  plasma levels in studied groups. The results show that  carriers of CGTC (LYQA) haplotype in ischemic stroke  group had significantly decreased MBL plasma levels  compared with control carriers ( Figure 7A ), while the  opposite trend was observed when comparing non-carriers  ( Figure 7B ). Interestingly, in control subjects the carriage  of this haplotype was associated with increased MBL  plasma levels ( Figure 7D ), while no difference between  carriers and non-carriers was observed within the ischemic  stroke group ( Figure 7C ). No association of MBL plasma  levels with other haplotypes were noted in both study  groups (data are not presented).  

# Discussion  

The present study aimed at assessment of plasma levels  changes of the LCP PRMs, MBL and M-ficolin in  ischemic stroke, evaluation of possible association of the  functional SNPs in the  MBL2, FCN1  and  FCN2  genes with  the disease, as well as examining the effects of these SNPs  on the corresponding protein levels in Armenians.

( A ) Levels of MBL in plasma of ischemic stroke patients (IS) and control subjects (CS) with the CGTC (LYQA) haplotype; ( B ) Levels of MBL in plasma of ischemic  stroke patients (IS) and control subjects (CS) without the CGTC (LYQA) haplotype; ( C ) Levels of MBL in plasma of ischemic stroke patients (IS) both with and without the  CGTC (LYQA) haplotype; ( D ) Levels of MBL in plasma of control subjects (CS) both with and without the CGTC (LYQA) haplotype.  

We observed a tendency of increase in the MBL plasma  levels in ischemic stroke, but this difference was not statis­ tically significant, which is in line with results reported by  Zangari et al. on the delayed elevation of MBL levels at 3–5  days and one month after stroke onset. Similar observa­ tions on delayed MBL increase at 24–72 hours of admission  were reported by Wang et al. Furthermore, it was shown  that the MBL levels in the patients with MBL-low  genotypes do not change on the 0, 1, 3 and 7 days after  stroke onset, while MBL levels in those with MBL-suffi­ cient genotypes decrease on day 1 with subsequent increase  with the highest level at day 7.  

The genotyping of the  MBL2  gene aimed to find a possi­ ble association of the functional genetic polymorphisms in  this gene with ischemic stroke revealed that the rs11003125  (H/L) and rs12780112 (P/Q) SNPs in  MBL2  gene, as well as  the rs  $12780112^{*}\mathrm{T(Q)}$   minor allele are negatively associated  with the risk of ischemic stroke, suggesting their protective  role for the development of this disease.  

Further, we aimed to examine if the levels of MBL in  plasma are genetically determined in ischemic stroke by  the very same SNPs as determined by previous investiga­ tions. We found that in ischemic stroke patients the  rs11003125 (H/L) SNP and the carriage of its minor C  allele gene markedly increase the MBL level, while the  rs1800450 (A/B) and the carriage of its minor A allele in  the same gene significantly decrease the plasma MBL  levels. In contrast, in control subjects the rs11003125 (H/  L) SNP in  MBL2  gene and the carriage of its minor C  allele, as well as rs12780112 (P/Q) SNP and the carriage  of its minor T allele significantly increase the MBL level,  while rs5030737 (A/D) and the carriage of its minor T  allele, the rs1800450 (A/B) SNP and the carriage of its  minor A allele, as well as the carriage of the minor G  allele of the rs7096206 (X/Y) SNP and the carriage of the  minor A allele of the rs1800451 (A/C) SNP significantly  decrease the plasma MBL levels. And finally, in the entire  study population  MBL2  rs11003125 (H/L) SNP and the  carriage of its minor C allele, as well as rs12780112 (P/Q)  SNP and the carriage of its minor T allele significantly  increase, while rs5030737 (A/D) SNP and the carriage of  its minor T allele, as well as rs1800450 (A/B) and  rs1800451 (A/C) SNPs and their minor allele carriage  rates markedly decrease the plasma MBL levels.  

From the six investigated SNPs in  MBL2  gene,  rs11003125 (H/L), rs7096206 (X/Y) and rs12780112 (P/  Q), located at positions  $-550$   bp,   $-221$   bp and   $+4$   bp, and  giving rise to the   $\mathit{M B L2}\mathit{*}\mathit{H}/L$  ,   $X/Y$    and   $P/Q$    alleles  ( Figure 8A ), respectively, have been shown to affect  the MBL serum levels. , Particularly, rs7096206 was  found to decrease the levels of fully functional MBL  proteins, , , which is in line with our findings.  

The rs5030737 (A/D), rs1800450 (A/B) and rs1800451  (A/C) structural non-synonymous SNPs giving rise to the   $M B L2^{*}\,A/D,\,A/E$    and   $A/C$    alleles in codons 52, 54 and 57  have been shown to affect the tertiary structure of the  collage nous region of the protein and reduce the circulat­ ing MBL levels. , , , , , , The rs5030737 (A/D)  SNP causes the substitution of arginine to cysteine at  position 52 (p.R52C), the rs1800450 (A/B) causes the  substitution of glycine to aspartic acid at position 54 (p.  G54D), and the rs1800451 (A/C) SNP causes the substitu­ tion of glycine for glutamic acid at position 57 (p.G57E),  altering the secondary structure of the collage nous triple  helix of MBL molecule and decreasing the serum MBL  level. , , According to data available in the UniProt  database ( http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P11226 ) there is  an association between low levels of MBL and defective  op so niz ation, which could affect the ops on oph ago cy tic  capacity of the immune system to remove damaged or  apoptotic neuronal cells, thereby triggering the formation  , of penumbra and development of ischemic stroke. It  should be noted that these differences in associations  between the ischemic stroke and the control cohort have  been seen for the first time and presently are unexplained. The further analysis of the LD pattern between the  studied SNPs in  MBL2  gene found a strong linkage  between the  MBL2  gene rs11003125 (H/L), rs7096206  (X/Y), rs12780112 (P/Q) and rs5030737 (A/D) SNPs giv­ ing rise to a common one-block structure in both ischemic  stroke patients and control subjects groups. Consequently,  we revealed that these SNPs give rise to five common  haplotypes, GGCC, CCCC, CGCC, CGTC and GGCT,  which refer to HYPA, LXPA, LYPA, LYQA and HYPD,  respectively. Accordingly, CGTC or LYQA was found to  be negatively associated with ischemic stroke suggesting  its protective role for the development of this pathology.  

It has been shown that four  MBL2  haplotypes, YB, YC,  YD and XA, are associated with low levels of MBL. Moreover, the H and L variants have been found to be in  LD with X and Y variants giving rise to haplotypes HY,  LY and LX. Particularly, HY was found to be associated  with increased MBL levels, LY – with middle MBL levels,  and LX – with decreased MBL levels. Moreover, the  frequencies of HYPA, HXPA, LYPA, LYQA, LXPA,  LYPB, LYQC and HYPD haplotypes have been found to  differ between different populations. , , ,  

It should be noted that from the five haplotypes  revealed in our study, HYPA, LYPA and LYQA have  been shown to be associated with the elevated MBL levels,  while LXPA and HYPD have been found to be associated  with MBL deficiency. This is in line with our findings  showing that the MBL levels in LYQA carriers are higher  in the control group. However, we ended up with an  interesting and previously not described finding that in  ischemic stroke the carriage of LYQA haplotype is asso­ ciated with low MBL levels compared with control car­ riers, which, in principle, is expected as PRMs have been  shown to play a crucial role in the vascular processes.  

Further, in a study involving a North Chinese Han popu­ lation, a strong LD was found between the rs1800450 (A/B)  and rs11003125 (H/L) SNPs showing the haplotype

consisting of rs1  $\ensuremath{\{800450^{*}}}\mathrm{G}$   and rs1  $1003125^{\ast}\mathrm{C}$   alleles to be  associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, GG  (from GG, GA, AA) and CC (from GG, GC, CC) genotypes  of the rs1800450 (A/B) and rs11003125 (H/L) SNPs, respec­ tively, have been found to be associated with high serum  levels in the same population, and the GG and GA genotypes  of rs1800450 (A/B) SNP were found to be associated with  type 2 diabetes mellitus. In contrast, the GC genotype of the  rs11003125 SNP demonstrated protective effect for the risk  of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  

Ficolins are another PRMs of the LCP, which prefer­ ably bind to acetylated ligands, unlike MBL mainly target­ ing carbohydrates. Similar to MBL, ficolins are also  composed of three identical polypeptides having a signal  peptide, N-terminal region, collagen-like domain, linker  region and fibrinogen-like domain in their structure  , , ( Figure 8B  and  C ). In our study, we found signifi­ cantly higher levels of M-ficolin in plasma of ischemic  stroke patients compared with control subjects. It should  be noted that in the case of M-ficolin the frequency dis­ tribution was relatively compact, and there were no  patients with M-ficolin plasma levels less than   $100\,\mathrm{\Deltang/\Omega}$    mL. These results are in contrast to the results of Zangari  et al. reporting a decrease in M-ficolin levels in patients at  6 hours and increase at 48 hours after stroke onset. However, it must be pointed out that in our study the  M-ficolin levels were measured up to 12 hours after stroke  onset, which could indicate the intermediate continuous  elevation.  

The genotyping of the  FCN1  and  FCN2  genes aimed to  find possible association of the functional genetic poly­ morphisms in these genes with ischemic stroke demon­ strated that the T minor allele of the rs10120023 SNP in  FCN1  gene is negatively associated with the risk of  ischemic stroke, suggesting its protective role for the  development of this disease. Further, the analysis aimed  to identify whether the levels of M-ficolin in plasma are  genetically determined in ischemic stroke, showed that the  rs2989727 SNP and the carriage of the minor T allele of  the rs10120023 SNP in  FCN1  gene markedly decreases  the plasma M-ficolin levels in ischemic stroke, while the  rs10120023 SNP significantly increases and the carriage of  the minor T allele of the rs2989727 SNP markedly  decreases those levels in control subjects. And conse­ quently, rs2989727 SNP and the carriage of its minor T  allele significantly decrease, while rs10120023 SNP and  the carriage of its minor T allele significantly increase  these levels in entire study population.  

Both investigated SNPs in  FCN1  gene, rs10120023 and  rs2989727, have been shown to affect the M-ficolin circulating  levels. , Particularly, rs10120023 was found to increase the  levels of fully functional M-ficolin proteins. , The in silico  analysis of this SNP shown that the minor T allele is located at  the YY1 transcription-factor-binding site, which was found  also in the promoter to the gene encoding granulocyte-macro­ phage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and enhanced  gene expression. , On the other hand, GM-CSF is a proin­ flammatory cytokine possessing neuro protective and angio­ , genic capacities in neural cells, confirming our finding of  the protective role of this SNP. Thus, Vander Cruyssen et al.  found rs2989727 SNP to be associated with the susceptibility  for rheumatoid arthritis, in contrast to Addobbati et al.  reporting no association between rs2989727 and this disease. Another study by Ammitzbøll et al. also did not find any  association between this SNP and M-ficolin levels. Moreover, there is no association between this SNP and dis­ eases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes  mellitus, celiac disease and autoimmune thyroid it is. , It was  revealed also that rs2989727 do not affect the expression of  FCN1  in monocytes.  

All the three investigated SNPs in  FCN2  gene,  rs3124952, rs3124953 and rs17514136, have been shown  to affect the L-ficolin levels and/or binding capacity. Particularly, rs3124952 has been found to decrease, while  rs3124953 and rs17514136 have been found to increase  L-ficolin levels 39  in a gene dose-dependent manner in  healthy individuals. Moreover, these SNPs have been  reported to be associated with respiratory infections in  children, rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, leprosy,  malaria, hepatitis B, cutaneous le ishman i as is and  pulmonary tuberculosis. , However, similar to our  study, no association was found between these SNPs and  dental caries in Polish children.  

The further analysis of the LD pattern between the  studied SNPs in  FCN1  and  FCN2  genes in ischemic stroke  patients and control subjects found one LD block in  FCN1  gene, consisting of rs10120023 and rs2989727 SNPs, and  another LD block in  FCN2  gene, consisting of rs3124952,  rs3124953, rs17514136 SNPs. Consequently, we found  that these SNPs give rise to three common haplotypes in  each gene, CT, CC and TC in FCN1 gene, and GAA, AAG  and AGA. However, none of these defined haplotypes  showed association with ischemic stroke.  

LCP PRMs possess pro inflammatory, pro coagulant and  pro thr ombo tic features, which, on the other hand, are  events taking place in vascular processes and clot  formation. , , The domain in their structure responsible  for fibrinogen recognition allows these PRMs to bind with  fibrinogen, thereby not only inducing the activation of the  LCP but also triggering coagulation processes. , ,  

It should be emphasized that in contrast to these  diverse effects of the genotypes and carriages of the  minor alleles of the certain SNPs on the levels of MBL  and M-ficolin in plasma, they all have the same profile in  all studied groups, i.e. ischemic stroke patients, control  subjects and the entire study population, even in cases  where  no  significant  differences  were  found.  Unexpectedly, no statistically significant differences were  seen on the potential influence of the found alterations on  the ischemic lesion volume and functional outcomes (the  data are not presented). Despite the important findings in  this and several other studies on the involvement of the  certain SNPs in  MBL2, FCN1  and  FCN2  genes in the risk  of the development of ischemic stroke, further proteomic  and genomic analyses are required to unravel the patho­ physiological role of LCP PRMs in the development,  severity and outcome of ischemic stroke pathology. To  our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating  these studied 11 SNPs in ischemic stroke. Moreover, this  is the first study to investigate the possible association of  11 SNPs in  MBL2, FCN1  and  FCN2  genes in Armenians.  

The potential limitations of this study include the small  cohort size that, however, is relevant due to the small  general population of Armenia, only up to 3 million  people. Another limitation is that we did not study the  levels of L-ficolin in this study, which made it impossible  to analyze the statistical significance of the genetic impact  of the studied SNPs and identified haplotypes in FCN2  gene on the L-ficolin plasma levels. And finally, we did  not measure the levels of MBL and M-ficolin in plasma in  dynamics which made it impossible to study their effect on  the severity and outcome of ischemic stroke.  

# Conclusions  

In conclusion, our study emphasizes the important contri­ bution of alterations of LCP PRMs on genomic and pro­ teomic levels to the path o mechanisms of ischemic stroke,  at least in the Armenian population. Our results suggest  that PRMs of LCP, MBL and M-ficolin may be associated  with ischemic stroke development risk and also may par­ ticipate in pathological events leading to post-ischemic  brain damage. Furthermore, rs11003125 (H/L) and  rs12780112 (P/Q) SNPs and CGTC (LYQA) haplotype in  MBL2  gene, as well as rs10120023 SNP in  FCN1  gene are  strongly associated with ischemic stroke, and the   $\mathrm{rs}12780112^{*}\mathrm{T}$   and r  $\mathrm{s}10120023^{*}\mathrm{T}$   minor alleles of these  polymorphisms, as well as CGTC (LYQA) haplotype may  be considered as protective factors for ischemic stroke at  least in the Armenian population. However, further studies  are needed to confirm our data on other populations and to  reveal the e tio path o physiological mechanisms of the  alterations of MBL and M-ficolin levels in ischemic  stroke. Thus, it is necessary to study the potential thera­ peutic effect of PRMs and/or their targets to increase the  effectiveness of the therapeutic strategies in ischemic  stroke treatment and recovery, as well as prevention from  the perspective of genomics and individualized medicine.
