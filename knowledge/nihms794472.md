# Abstract  

OBJECTIVE— Symptomatic intra cranial at hero sclerotic disease (ICAD) has a high risk of  recurrent stroke. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 and CES1 are associated with adverse  

outcomes in cardiovascular patients, but have not been studied in ICAD. The authors studied  CYP2C19 and CES1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in symptomatic ICAD patients.  

METHODS— Genotype testing for   $C Y P2C I g*_{2,}$   \*3, \*8, \*17 and CES1 G143E was performed  on 188 adult symptomatic ICAD patients from 3 medical centers who were medically managed  with clop i dog rel and aspirin. Testing was performed prospectively at 1 center, and retrospectively  from a DNA sample bio repository at 2 centers. Multiple logistic regression and Cox regression  analysis were performed to assess the association of these SNPs with the primary endpoint, which  was a composite of transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within  12 months.  

RESULTS— The primary endpoint occurred in   $14.9\%$   of the 188 cases. In multiple logistic  regression analysis, the presence of the CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) alleles   $^{*2,*3,}$   and   $^*g$  in  the medically managed patients was associated with lower odds of primary endpoint compared  with wild-type homozygotes (odds ratio [OR] 0.13,  $95\%$   CI 0.03–0.62,  $\mathtt{p}=0.0101$  ). Cox  regression analysis demonstrated the   $C Y P2C I g\mathrm{{LF}}$   carriers had a lower risk for the primary  endpoint, with hazard ratio (HR) of 0.27 (  $95\%$   CI 0.08–0.95),  $\mathsf{p}=0.041$  . A sensitivity analysis of a  secondary composite endpoint of TIA, stroke, or death demonstrated a significant trend in multiple  logistic regression analysis of   $C Y P2C l9$  variants, with lower odds of secondary endpoint in  patients carrying at least 1 LOF allele   $(^{*}2,\ ^{*}3,\ ^{*}8)$  than in wild-type homozygotes (OR 0.27,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,0.06{-}1.16$  ,  $\mathsf{p}=0.078)$  ). Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the carriers of CYP2C19 LOF  alleles had a lower risk for the secondary composite endpoint (HR 0.22,  $95\%$   CI 0.05–1.04,  ${\mathfrak{p}}=$  0.056).  

CONCLUSIONS— This is the first study examining genetic variants and their effects in  symptomatic ICAD. Variant alleles of   $C Y P2C I9\,(^{*2},\,^{*3},\,^{*}\!g)$  were associated with lower odds of  the primary and secondary composite endpoints. However, the direction of the association was  opposite of what is expected based on this SNP. This may reflect an incomplete understanding of  this genetic variation and its effect in symptomatic ICAD and warrants further investigations.

Symptomatic intra cranial at hero sclerotic disease (ICAD) is the most common cause of  stroke worldwide and is associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke.  The results of the  recently completed Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent  stroke in Intra cranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial suggest that aggressive medical  management alone is superior to percutaneous trans lumina l angioplasty and stenting (PTAS)  plus aggressive medical management in preventing stroke or death in patients with  symptomatic ICAD.  Even though the risk of stroke or death in the SAMMPRIS trial was  lower than seen in the Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intra cranial Disease (WASID) trial,  this risk in either the PTAS group or the medically managed group is still unacceptably high,   $23\%$   in the PTAS group and  $15\%$   in the medically managed group.  

In both the PTAS and the medical arms of the SAMMPRIS trial, patients were treated with  aspirin and clop i dog rel dual-anti platelet therapy reflecting current management of  

symptomatic ICAD. Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes such as  cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and carboxyl est erase 1 (CES1) have been shown to affect the  anti platelet activity of clop i dog rel  and have been associated with increased risk of  cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in patients with acute coronary  syndrome 17  and patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions.  It therefore  seems possible that failure of aspirin and clop i dog rel therapy in preventing stroke or death in  symptomatic ICAD patients could be due to genetic polymorphisms that inhibit the  anti platelet activity of clop i dog rel.  

We conducted this study to test our hypothesis that polymorphisms in CYP2C19 and CES1  affect the efficacy of aspirin and clop i dog rel dual-anti platelet therapy in patients with  symptomatic ICAD. This is the first study of which we are aware that examines genetic  variants and their effects on the efficacy of clop i dog rel in symptomatic ICAD.  

#  Methods  

Symptomatic ICAD patients taking clop i dog rel and aspirin were studied from 3 centers: the  University of Florida, Vanderbilt University, and Marshfield Clinic. This study was approved  by the institutional review boards of all 3 institutions. The following inclusion criteria were  used to enroll/identify patients: age 18 years or older, stroke or transient ischemic attack  (TIA) attributable to  $50\%$   or greater stenosis of a major intra cranial artery, and treatment  with aspirin and clop i dog rel for 3 months or longer. Patients with moyamoya disease were  excluded from this study.  

At one of the 3 centers (University of Florida), patients were prospectively enrolled, and  DNA samples were prospectively collected. At the other 2 centers (Vanderbilt University  and Marshfield Clinic), patients were retrospectively identified from the electronic medical  record using an ICD-9–based algorithm, followed by manual review of the electronic charts  of each of the patients to verify accuracy, and DNA samples were obtained from a  bio repository of stored patient samples.  

Patients provided a sample of either saliva or blood. Patient samples from the University of  Florida were genotyped at the University of Florida through the Sequenom, pyro sequencing  (Qiagen) or Taqman (Life Technologies) genotyping method for the following variants:   $C Y P2C I g*_{2}$  (rs4244285,  $\mathrm{G>A}$  ),   $C Y P2C I g*_{3}$  (rs4986893,  $\mathbf{G}>\mathbf{A}_{c}$  ), CYP2C19\* 8 

 (rs41291556,  $\mathbf{\mathcal{T}}>\mathbf{C}$  ), CYP2C19\*17 (rs12248560,  $\mathbf{G}>\mathbf{A}_{i}$  ), and CES1 G143E (rs71647871, G 

  $>\mathrm{A}_{c}$  ).  

Patient samples from Vanderbilt University and Marshfield clinic were genotyped at  Vanderbilt University by the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics core with a  combination of TaqMan Assay (rs12248560) and the Sequenom genotyping platform  (rs4244285, rs4986893, rs41291556, rs71647871, rs12041331, rs662, rs854560).  Genotyping efficiency was  $100\%$   in all samples, and genotypes conformed to expectations  under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Quality control also included inter- and intraplate  replicate samples and HapMap controls showing   $100\%$   concordance and zero Mendelian  errors.  

The primary endpoint was a predefined composite of TIA, stroke, myocardial infarction, or  death within 12 months of beginning clop i dog rel. A sensitivity analysis of a secondary  composite endpoint of TIA, stroke, or death within 12 months of beginning clop i dog rel was  also performed. Patients who were treated with PTAS and patients treated medically were  analyzed separately, as we would expect a different rate of the primary endpoint between the  2 groups based on previous studies.  After identification/enrollment of patients and  collection of samples, the number of patients in the PTAS group with an event was too low  to allow for meaningful conclusions. Therefore, PTAS-treated patients were excluded and  only medically managed patients were included.  

#  Statistical Analysis  

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated within race/ethnicity using chi-square tests with  1 degree of freedom. CYP2C9 polymorphisms   $^{*2,*3,}$   and   $^*g$  were combined for the number  of loss of function (LOF) alleles (0, 1, or 2). Due to the low number of individuals with 2  copies of LOF alleles, patients with 1 or 2 copies of LOF alleles were combined as LOF  allele carriers. Due to the functional basis of these variants, we performed the association  analysis in the combined data set, adjusting for the race group. Multiple logistic regression  was performed to assess the association of CYP2C19 polymorphisms or CES1 G143E  genotype and the primary endpoint (the occurrence of TIA, stroke, myocardial infarction, or  death within 12 months of initiation of clop i dog rel therapy) and the secondary endpoint (the  occurrence of TIA, stroke, or death within 12 months of initiation of clop i dog rel therapy)  adjusting for covariates: site, age, sex, race, hypertension, diabetes, taking lipid-lowering  medication, and taking a proton pump inhibitor. A Kaplan-Meier curve was constructed by  CYP2C19 LOF carrier status, and log-rank tests were performed to compare time to event  by the carrier status. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the time  to the primary and secondary endpoint. The covariates adjusted in the Cox regression  analysis were the same as those used in the logistic regression analysis; p values  $<0.025$    were considered statistically significant because 2 genes were examined. All statistical  analyses were performed in SAS 9.2.  

#  Results  

A total of 188 medically managed patients were included in the study. Their baseline  demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. The patients had an average age of 67  years;  $63.3\%$   were males and more than   $84\%$   were white. Of the 188 patients,  $92.6\%$   had a  history of hypertension, and  $93.1\%$   were treated with lipid-lowering medications, while  about  $58\%$   were taking a proton pump inhibitor.  

The primary endpoint (TIA, stroke, MI, death) occurred in  $14.9\%$   of medically treated  patients (28/188) (Table 2). The secondary endpoint (TIA, stroke, death) occurred in   $11.2\%$    of medically treated patients (21/188) (Table 2). The remainder of the patients did not have  an event within the first 12 months after initiation of clop i dog rel treatment.  

The genotype frequencies of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) did not deviate  from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium when tested with the patients stratified by race or as a  single group (all p values  $>0.05$  ). The allele frequencies of the 5 SNPs are shown in Table 3.  

In all the studied patients, 1 heterozygote for   $C Y P2C I g*_{3}$  and 1 heterozygote for   $^*g$  were  observed. The allele frequencies for CYP2C19\*2,   $C Y P2C I9^{*}I7,$   and CES1 G143E were   $14\%$  ,  $21\%$  , and  $0.017\%$  , respectively, consistent with those reported in the 1000 genomes  project. Due to the low allele frequency of   $C Y P2C I g*_{3}$  and   $^{*}\!g,$   the number of CYP2C19  LOF alleles was calculated, combining these 2 variants with the   $^{*2}$  variant. Twenty-seven  percent of the participants had 1 or 2 LOF CYP2C19 alleles.  

In the unadjusted analysis, none of the SNPs reached statistical significance (data not  shown). After adjusting for covariates, in multiple logistic regression analysis, carriers of  CYP2C19 LOF alleles   $^{*2,}$   \*3  $^*g$  had lower odds of the primary endpoint in the medical  group compared with wild-type homozygotes (OR 0.13,  $95\%$   CI 0.03–0.62,  ${\tt p}=0.01$  ) (Table  4). A Kaplan-Meier curve by CYP2C19 LOF carrier status is shown in Fig. 1 (upper). The  log-rank p value was 0.059.  

Cox regression analysis showed that after adjusting for covariates, the risk for the primary  endpoint was lower in the carriers of at least one   $C Y P2C I g_{\mathrm{LOF}}$   allele compared with those  with wild-type homozygotes, with a hazard ratio of 0.27 (  $95\%$   CI 0.08–0.95,  $\mathsf{p}=0.041$  ). The  number of events in the PTSA group was too small to estimate the odds ratios and hazard  ratios; therefore PTSA-treated patients were excluded from the analysis. A sensitivity  analysis was performed of a secondary composite endpoint of TIA, stroke, or death. After  adjusting for covariates, in multiple logistic regression analysis, carriers of CYP2C19 LOF  alleles   $^{*2,}$   \*3  $^*g$  had lower odds of the secondary composite endpoint in the medical group  compared with wild-type homozygotes (OR 0.27,  $95\%$   CI 0.06–1.16,  $\mathsf{p}=0.078)$  ) (Table 5).  Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the CYP2C19 LOF carriers had a lower risk for  the secondary composite endpoint, with a hazard ratio of 0.22   $95\%$   CI 0.05–1.04,  ${\mathfrak{p}}=$  0.056).  

A secondary analysis was performed excluding one of the retrospective centers (Vanderbilt)  because the incidence of the endpoints at that center was disparate from the other 2 centers  (University of Florida and Marshfield), which had very similar incidences of the endpoints.  The secondary analysis included 93 patients, and the results were largely similar to the  analysis that included all 3 centers. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated  that the LOF variant alleles of   $C Y P2C I9\,(^{*}2,\,^{*}3,\,^{*}\!8)$  were associated with lower odds of  primary endpoint in the medical group compared with wild-type homozygotes (OR 0.17,   $95\%$   CI 0.04–0.82,  $\mathsf{p}=0.0273)$  ). The Kaplan- Meier curve by CYP2C19 LOF allele carrier  status is shown in Fig. 1 (lower). The log-rank p value was 0.0502. The adjusted hazard ratio  for the primary endpoint was 0.23   $95\%$   CI 0.06–0.85,  $\mathsf{p}=0.0268)$   for CYP2C19 LOF  carriers compared with those with no LOF alleles.  

#  Discussion  

This is the first study of which we are aware that examines genetic variants and their effects  on the efficacy of clop i dog rel in symptomatic ICAD. In our group of medically treated  patients, the   $^{*2,*3,}$   $^*g$  variant alleles of CYP2C19 were associated with lower odds of the  primary endpoint (TIA, stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 12 months of  beginning clop i dog rel) and the secondary endpoint (TIA, stroke, or death within 12 months  of beginning clop i dog rel) in symptomatic ICAD patients treated with aspirin and  clop i dog rel. However, this finding is antithetical to what we would expect for these variant  alleles, which are LOF alleles; the expected finding would be higher odds of the primary and  secondary endpoint. The direction of this correlation was unexpected given the well-known  association between CYP2C19 genetic variation and increased risk of cardiovascular death,  MI, or stroke in acute coronary syndrome patients 17  and percutaneous coronary intervention  patients.  In terms of cerebro vascular disease, CYP2C19 polymorphisms seem to correlate  with 3-month and 6-month modified Rankin Scale outcomes in Chinese stroke patients,  although ICAD and the risk of recurrent stroke have not been specifically examined until  this present study.  Additionally, there may be an association between CYP2C19 LOF  genotypes and in-stent restenosis in Chinese patients treated with vertebral artery stenting. More than 25 variant alleles have been reported for the CYP2C19 gene.   $C Y P2C I g*2,*$  3,  and   $^*g$  are all LOF alleles, and   $C Y P2C I9^{*}I7$  is a gain-of-function allele. The   $C Y P2C I g*_{2}$  SNP (rs4244285, G681A) in exon 5 results in a splice defect;   $C Y P2C I g*_{3}$  (rs4986893, G >  A) in exon 4 produces a stop codon;   $C Y P2C I9^{*}\delta(\mathrm{rs}41291556,\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{C})$  , a change of  Trp120Arg in exon 3 that affects the catalytic activity of the CYP2C19 enzyme; and the  gain-of-function   $C Y P2C I9^{*}I7(\mathrm{rs}12248560,\mathrm{G>A})$  , which affects the the promoter region,  increases the CYP2C19 gene expression level.  

There are many possible explanations for our observed findings. First, the heterogeneity of  the various ways ICAD can lead to stroke or TIA, in comparison with coronary  at hero sclerotic disease, could suggest that features of ICAD differ from coronary  atherosclerosis, and we may not observe the same findings in the 2 disease states.  Second,  it is possible that clop i dog rel is not efficacious in preventing stroke in ICAD, and that the  observed results in medically managed patients are due to other interventions, such as statin  therapy, blood pressure reduction, smoking cessation, and diabetes management. Other  studies, such as those in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving clop i dog rel, have shown a  lack of the expected genetic effect when the overall efficacy of the drug is lacking.  Finally,  it is important to note that our sample size in this study is relatively small, and the observed  findings could be due to chance and lack of power to detect a true genetic effect.  

Our analysis adjusted for a number of covariates, including factors that are known to affect  clop i dog rel response, such as proton pump inhibitor use, and factors that affect event rate  such as hypertension.  

Our results did not show an association between genetic variants of CES1 and the primary  endpoint. Carboxyl est erase 1 is a serine esterase that is the primary enzyme responsible for  metabolizing clop i dog rel, its intermediate metabolite (2-oxo-clop i dog rel), and the final  bioactive thiol metabolite into biologically inactive carboxylic acid derivatives.  The  $\mathbf{G}>\mathbf{A}$    (rs71647871) variation in exon 4 of CES1 results in a non conservative substitution,  p.Gly143Glu, and in vitro functional studies have shown that the catalytic function of  p.Gly143Glu is substantially impaired, resulting in a complete loss of hydrolytic activity of  carboxyl est erase 1 toward methylphenidate.  Thus, the expected effect of CES1 G143E  (rs71647871,  $\mathbf{G}>\mathbf{A}$  ) polymorphism would be that it would cause reduced degradation of  clop i dog rel, leading to more of the drug being available to go down the bio activation  pathway, leading to enhanced anti platelet activity of clop i dog rel.  There have been no prior  studies examining CES1 G143E (rs71647871,  $\mathbf{G}>\mathbf{A}_{i}$  ) polymorphism and clop i dog rel  efficacy in cardiovascular or stroke patients, thus the non-association may reflect an  incomplete understanding of the clinical effects of   $C E S I$  genetic variation in cardiovascular  disease and stroke, and warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, due to the very low  incidence of CES1 genetic variation, our study was unable to demonstrate an association  with CES1 variants and the primary and secondary composite endpoints.  

Our study highlights the disparity in findings from a prospective study contrasted with a  retrospective analysis from electronic medical records. One of the centers in this study  (Vanderbilt), which conducted a retrospective analysis of data from electronic medical  records, had incidences of the clinical endpoints that were significantly lower than expected  for the natural history of the disease.  The incidence of the clinical endpoints at this center  was significantly different than at the other 2 centers, which had similar incidences for the  endpoints. This was the reason we conducted a secondary analysis excluding this center. We  believe this highlights a significant limitation of retrospective analysis for these types of  studies. There has recently been great interest in genotypic and comparative analysis studies  from electronic medical records. This enthusiasm for “big data” has led to significant  interest in capturing clinical data from large electronic medical databases using billing and  procedure codes. The advantage of these studies is the ability to capture large amounts of  patient data across many centers. Many studies use an ICD-9-code–based query for the  identification of patients and data, much like what was conducted at two of the centers in our  study (Vanderbilt and Marshfield). In performing this study, however, we were clearly more  confident in the ability in the prospective arm of the study to accurately identify patients  who appropriately qualified according to all inclusion and exclusion criteria and the ability  to accurately adjudicate clinical endpoints than in the retrospective arms of the study. We  believe that this is a strong argument for funding and conducting prospective studies and a  cause for cautionary concern regarding analysis of data from electronic medical records  databases.  

The combining of prospective data from 1 center with retrospective data from 2 centers was  necessary to achieve an adequate sample size based on our prestudy power analysis. We took  advantage of the bio repositories already established at two of the centers via the  P harm a co genomics Research Network (PGRN). However, there are obvious limitations of  combining prospective data with retrospective data. Our finding of disparate incidences of  the endpoints at one of the retrospective centers demonstrates some of the shortcomings of  retrospective data collection and analysis. There has been great enthusiasm for comparative  effectiveness research utilizing electronic medical records and “big data.” However, we feel  that our study highlights the limitations of retrospective electronic capture of clinical data,  which we believe does not match the scientific rigor of prospective enrollment and analysis.  Therefore, we believe that it is critical to fund and implement prospective studies to address  these questions.  

In this study, we did not collect and analyze functional assays such as platelet function tests,  platelet aggregation studies, thr ombo el as to graph y, or P2Y12 receptor tests. The DNA  samples from the 2 retrospective centers were collected from established bio repositories;  thus the performance of platelet function assays was not possible. There are limitations of  such platelet function tests such as the proper timing of these tests, variability among testing  sites, and variability in interpretation. Nevertheless, in future investigations, it would be  interesting to study the association of p harm a co genomic variations with these functional  platelet assays.  

#  Conclusions  

While the findings of the recently completed SAMMPRIS trial  suggest that medical  management is superior to PTAS for patients with symptomatic ICAD, there are still  subgroups of patients at unacceptably high risk of recurrent stroke despite aggressive  medical management. Since the medical management of symptomatic ICAD is aspirin and  clop i dig rel dual anti platelet therapy, it seems quite possible that patients with genetic  variants predisposing to reduced anti platelet efficacy of clop i dog rel may be at higher risk of  recurrent stroke. Defining these genetic variants and their association with the clinical  efficacy of clop i dog rel is important to the development of personalized therapeutic strategies  for these high-risk patients. The findings of this study are a first step, and while we found  that   $C Y P2C I g*2,*$   $^{*3,}$   and   $^*g$  were associated with lower odds of the primary and secondary  endpoints in the medical group compared with wild-type homozygotes, we do not  completely understand this relationship or the mechanism of action. Due to the low  incidence of CES1 genetic variation, our study was unable to demonstrate any association  between   $C E S I$  variations and the primary and secondary endpoints. Further, larger-scale,  prospective multi center studies will be necessary to better elucidate these questions.
