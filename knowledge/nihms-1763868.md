# Abstract  

Background and Purpose:  Recent evidence suggests that young women (18–45 years) may be  at higher risk of ischemic strokes than men of the same age. The goal of this systematic review is  to reconcile and synthesize existing evidence of sex differences among young adults with ischemic  strokes.  

Methods:  We searched PubMed from January 2008 to July 2021 for relevant articles and reviews  and consulted their references. We included original studies that (1) were population-based, (2)  reported stroke incidence by sex or sex specific incidence rate ratios of young adults ≤45 years.  We excluded studies that (1) omitted measurements of error for incidence rates or incidence rate  ratios, (2) omitted age adjustment, and (3) were not in English. Statistical synthesis was performed  to estimate sex difference by age group (≤35, 35–45 and ≤45) and stroke type.  

Results:  We found 19 studies that reported on sex-specific stroke incidence among young  adults, including three that reported on overlapping data. Nine studies did not find a statistically  significant sex difference among young adults   $\trianglelefteq5$   years. Three studies found higher rates of  ischemic stroke among men among young adults   ${\ge}30$   to 35 years. Four studies found more  

women with ischemic strokes among young adults   $\triangleleft5$   years. Overall, in young adults   $\triangleleft5$   years,  the estimated effect size favored more ischemic strokes in women (IRR 1.44[1.18–1.76],  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}82\%$  )  and a non-significant sex difference in young adults 35–45 years (IRR 1.08[0.85–1.38],  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}95\%$  ).  

Conclusion:  Overall, there were  $44\%$   more women   $\triangleleft5$   years with ischemic strokes than men.  This gap narrows in young adults, 35 to 45 years, and there is conflicting evidence whether more  men or women have ischemic strokes in the 35 to 45 age group.

# Introduction:  

The American Heart Association’s 2021 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update notes  that “age-specific incidence rates [of stroke] are substantially lower in females than males  in younger and middle-aged groups” 1  Historically, stroke epidemiologists believed men have  a higher incidence of strokes in every age group until the very elderly.  $2,3\,\mathrm{A}$   systematic  review by Appelros et al. in 2009, looking at sex differences in stroke epidemiology, found  that among young adults age 35 to 44 years, there were  $49\%$   more men than women with  incident strokes (including ischemic strokes, intra cranial hemorrhages (ICH), and strokes  of undetermined causes), and did not find any sex difference among adults younger than  age 35 years.  However, this study, which was focused on stroke incidence in all adult age  groups, only included a small number of cases in young adults under the age of 45 years.  Since that review, more recent evidence focused on the young adult age group has reported  that there are more young women (age 18 to 45) with ischemic strokes compared to young  men, suggesting that young women may be disproportionately at risk compared to their male  counterparts.  A better understanding of these sex differences is important to be able to  implement strategies to more effectively prevent and treat strokes in this age group. The goal  of this review is to reconcile and synthesize the updated evidence to better understand sex  differences in young adults with ischemic strokes.  

# Methods:  

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article and its online  supplementary files. Institutional review was exempted because this study relied only on  previously published data.  

We used methods previously described by Appelros et al. to search PubMed using the  algorithms (incidence[ti] OR epidemiology[ti] OR prevalence[ti]) AND (cerebro vascular[ti]  OR stroke[ti]); subtype[ti] AND (cerebro vascular[ti] OR stroke[ti]) from January 2008 until  July 2021.  Articles prior to 2008 were included in the systematic review by Appelros et  al. We examined both original studies and reviews on sex differences in stroke or young  

adult strokes. We reviewed these manuscripts’ citations to extract additional relevant articles.  We included original studies that (1) were population-based, (2) reported first-ever stroke  incidence by sex or sex specific incidence rate ratios (IRR) of adults younger than age  45 years. Since ischemic strokes comprise approximately  $87\%$   of all stroke types 1 , we  included studies that did not differentiate between stroke types, as the majority of these  cases were ischemic strokes. We excluded studies that (1) omitted any measurements of  error for incidence rates or IRR, (2) omitted age adjustments, and (3) were not written in  English. One reviewer (MHL) screened and reviewed full text as well as online supplements  for eligibility. Any studies with missing or ambiguous data or concern for high risk of bias  were discussed with a second reviewer (SNP or SS) until consensus was reached, and studies  with high risk of bias were not included.  

Study information was extracted by one reviewer (MHL) and checked for accuracy by  a second reviewer (SS). Information extracted included study characteristics (authors,  publication year, country), sex-specific stroke incidence by age group, characteristics  of the study population, study design (retrospective or prospective), methods of stroke  ascertainment (i.e. administrative claims or clinical data), and the method of calculating  incidence (i.e. Poisson model, adjustments for age and other variables) to assess study  quality and potential sources of bias (Supplemental Table T1).  

Results from each study were synthesized into IRR of women/men. Studies which did not  adjust for age were excluded because crude incidence rates of stroke in women and men  may not be comparable if they have different age distributions even within each age-group.  To obtain the IRR for each study, the female and male crude incidence rates have to  be standardized to the age structure of the total (female and male) population or another  standardized population. One study was excluded for not meeting this criteria.  

We calculated combined IRR by age group (≤35 years, 35–45 years, and ≤45 years) and  by ischemic stroke versus all stroke types. Studies that had qualifying IRR within each  age group were included. Sensitivity analysis was performed to include data prior to 2008  from Appelros et al.  The analysis was performed on all stroke types in age   ${\le}35$   years,  35–45 years, and   ${\le}45$   years, because there was no differentiation of ischemic strokes.  Analyses for an overall effect were performed with random effects models on the log of  the ratio estimates, weighted according to the variability of the estimates. The variability of  the estimates was calculated from the  $95\%$   confidence intervals. The combined ratios were  estimated, along with  $95\%$   confidence intervals, and p values testing the null hypothesis  of the IRR equaling one. Statistical significance was determined as  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05$  . The study  heterogeneity was measured with the  $\mathrm{I}^{2}$   statistic and forest plots were generated. The metaanalyses were performed in STATA MP 15.1 using the “metan”.  

# Results:  

Our search criteria yielded 1951 articles, of which 212 were relevant based on title  review and underwent abstract and full text review. We found 34 articles that contained  stroke incidence, including those extracted from citations of relevant articles. Finally, 19  articles satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including 3 articles that reported on  

overlapping data (Table 1, Supplemental Figure F1).  Of the 16 unique studies,  including a combined total of 69,793 young adults with stroke (33,775 women and 36,018  men calculated based on IRR), 9 did not find a statistically significant sex difference among  adults younger than age 45 years. Six of the 9 studies identified fewer than 100 cases of  stroke in adults younger than age 45 years, including 4 studies that identified fewer than  50 cases of stroke. Of these 9 studies, all but one were prospective studies, one was a doorto-door survey, and all performed case ascertainment based on clinical data (Supplemental  Table T1).  

Three studies found a sex difference with higher incidence amongst men, which was present  only in the older age groups. One study from Norway found  $41\%$   more men with ischemic  strokes in adults age 35 to 44 years (IRR [women/men] 0.71 [0.64:0.79]).  Another study  of strokes (including ischemic, ICH, and undetermined) in the United Kingdom, found   $18\%$    more men among adults age 30 to 34 years (IRR 0.85[0.76–0.96]), which increased to  $45\%$    more men in the 40 to 44 years age group (IRR 0.69[0.64–0.75]).  Finally, a Spanish study  found  $64\%$   more men with strokes (including ischemic, ICH, undetermined and transient  ischemic attacks [TIA]) among age 35 to 44 years (IRR 0.61[0.39–0.97]).  The two former  studies were retrospective and relied on administrative ascertainment of strokes. The latter  study was prospective and performed clinical case ascertainment.  

Four studies found a sex difference with higher incidence amongst women, which was  most evident among the younger age groups. One study in Dijon, France found   $89\%$    more women with strokes (including ischemic, ICH, sub ara ch noid hemorrhages [SAH], and  undetermined) among adults age 18 to 35 years (IRR 1.89[1.27–2.8]).  Another study in  Ontario, Canada found  $26\%$   more women with strokes (including ischemic, ICH, SAH, and  TIA) in adults younger than age 30 years (IRR 1.26[1.1–1.45]).  This difference increased  to  $33\%$   more women when only ischemic strokes were considered in those younger than  age 30 years (IRR 1.47[1.19–1.83]). Finally, two studies in the Netherlands and United  States both found more women than men with ischemic stroke in adults younger than age  45 years.  This difference was largest among the younger age groups. In the Dutch cohort,  twice as many women developed ischemic strokes among adults younger than age 30 years  (IRR 2.19[1.72–2.81]), which attenuated to  $20\%$   more women among adults age 40 to 44  years (1.20[1.11–1.31]).  Among Americans,   $42\%$   more women had ischemic strokes in  adults age 24 to 34 years (IRR 1.42[1.16–1.75]) compared to  $14\%$   more women in adults  age 35 to 44 years (IRR 1.14[1.02–1.28]).  The French study was prospective and relied on  clinical stroke ascertainment. Meanwhile, the Canadian, Dutch, and American studies were  all retrospective and relied on administrative data.  

Among the studies which reported on ischemic strokes, there was an overall effect of  higher incidence in women younger than age 35 years (IRR 1.44[1.18–1.76],  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}82\%$  , 

  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.01$  , Figure 1), no statistical sex difference in among adults age 35 to 45 years (IRR 

 1.10[0.91–1.33],  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}95\%$  ,  $\mathtt{p}{=}0.53$  , Figure 2) and an overall effect of more women younger  than age 45 years (IRR 1.24[1.08–1.43],  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}91\%$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.01$  , Figure 3). This effect became  attenuated when all stroke types were considered with higher incidence in women younger  than age 35 years (IRR 1.26[1.07–1.48],  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}86\%$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.01$  , Supplemental Figure F2), no  statistical difference among adults age 35 to 45 years (IRR 0.89[0.75–1.05],  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}94\%$  ,  

$\tt p{=}0.16$  , Supplemental Figure F3) or younger than age 45 years (IRR 1.07[0.96–1.18], 

  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}90\%$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.21$  , Supplemental Figure F4). After the inclusion of data prior to 2008 from  Appelros et al., there was no change in the direction or significance of our findings (  $\triangleleft5$   IRR 

 1.23[1.05–1.44]  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}86\%$  , 35–45 IRR 0.86[0.73–1.02]  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}93\%$  ,   ${\le}45$   IRR 1.07[0.94–1.15] 

  $\mathrm{I}^{2}{=}90\%$  ).  

# Discussion:  

In this review, studies that identified a sex difference generally found that there were higher  incidences of women with ischemic strokes in the younger age groups (  $^{<30-35}$   years). This  finding was demonstrated in multiple developed countries, including France, Canada, the  Netherlands, and the United States.  The sex difference in the incidence of ischemic  strokes was the greatest and most evident among adults younger than age 35 years, with an  estimated  $44\%$   more women, though there is notable heterogeneity in this effect. This sex  difference narrows among adults ages 35 to 45 years, and there is contradictory evidence  whether young men may be more at risk of ischemic strokes in this age group.  

Some variability exists in sex differences across studies among the older age group   ${\scriptstyle\cdot>}30-35$    years). Two retrospective administrative studies from the Netherlands and United States  found more women between age 35 to 45 years with ischemic strokes while three studies  (two retrospective administrative from Norway and the United Kingdom and one prospective  from Spain) found more men between age 30 to 45 years with strokes. Methods of stroke  ascertainment may play a role in this difference. Both the Dutch and American studies  favoring more women used previously validated administrative algorithms of identifying  ischemic strokes 25 , which was then validated in young adults during the Dutch study. The two administrative studies favoring men did not. The Norwegian study reported on  the unique individuals who suffered ischemic strokes with episodes each year, which did  not guarantee that it was their first-ever ischemic stroke.  Meanwhile, the British study  adapted the code list from CALIBER, an open access phe no typing algorithm for United  Kingdom’s electronic health record’s data ( www.caliber research.org ), to define strokes that  included administrative codes for sequelae of cerebral infarction.  Hence, both studies  favoring men likely included recurrent strokes and non-acute strokes. Sex differences among  stroke recurrence and non-acute strokes are unknown and could favor men.  

The uncertainty surrounding sex differences in the incidence of ischemic strokes among  young adults is likely related to three main factors (1) small sample sizes, (2) failure  to differentiate ischemic strokes from other stroke types, and (3) broad age group  categorizations. The incidence of ischemic stroke increases exponentially with age and  only  $15\%$   of all ischemic strokes occur in adults younger than age 50 years.  While it is  relatively easy to study epidemiological sex differences among older adults, the same studies  in younger adults necessitate a much larger population. Prospective studies in this review  had smaller stroke case numbers and more difficulty detecting a statistically significant sex  difference. Six of the nine studies that did not find a sex difference identified fewer than 100  cases of stroke (4 identified less than 50 cases) among adults younger than age 45 years.  The three studies that identified more than 100 cases were the Greater Cincinnati Northern  Kentucky Stroke Study with 587 strokes (age  ${<}45$  ),  a Chinese cross-sectional survey with  152 strokes (age   ${<}50$  ),  and a community-based cohort in Joinville, Brazil with 200 strokes  (age 20–49).  With the exception of the Chinese study, all were prospective and relied  on stroke ascertainment based on clinical data. In contrast, retrospective studies were more  successful at capturing a large number of cases (all identified more than 1000 strokes in age  ≤ 45) but relied on administrative case ascertainment.  

To compensate for small sample sizes, there has been a tendency to group stroke types  together (i.e., ischemic, ICH, SAH, undetermined, and occasionally TIA). Unfortunately,  this can make results harder to interpret, as different prevalent etiologies inform specific  stroke types, i.e., ruptured aneurysms in SAH or uncontrolled hypertension in ICH.  In  addition, epidemiological differences between these subtypes are already known to exist. For  example, while the incidence of ischemic stroke increased over time among young adults,  this trend has not been observed in hemorrhagic strokes.  Notably, the sex differences  observed in ischemic stroke among young adults was not seen in ICH.  Underscoring this  point is that sex differences observed by both the Canadian and Dutch cohorts in this  review were larger when only ischemic strokes were considered compared to the addition  of other stroke types.  Attenuation of sex differences by including other stroke types  may also explain why nine studies failed to discern a sex difference. Not only did they  start with smaller sample sizes, but all except one included other stroke types (9 included  ICH, 8 included SAH, 2 included undetermined, 1 included TIA). Chief among them is  ICH, which has the second highest incidence behind ischemic stroke and has not shown  sex differences among young adults.  The IBERICTUS study from Spain was the only  prospective study to find more men (age 35–44) with strokes (including ischemic, ICH,  SAH, TIA, undetermined) and only one of two studies to include TIA.  The inclusion of so  many different stroke types could significantly distort the sex difference in ischemic stroke  incidence, especially when only a 79 cases were captured in this age group.  

Since ischemic stroke incidence increases exponentially with age, age-group breakdowns  become especially important. For example, among the 8,444 ischemic strokes in adults age  18 to 49 years in the Dutch cohort, the mean age was 46 years, with almost half of all  cases   $\mathrm{(n}{=}\,3{,}997]$  ) occurring in the oldest age group (age 45–49).  Hence, larger age groups  among ischemic strokes are most representative of the oldest rather than the average of the  age group. In one analysis of the Dijon Stroke Registry, Bejot et al. noted a higher incidence  of strokes among men in adults younger than age 55 years.  However, these results were  most representative of the cohort closest to 55 years old, as a subsequent analysis of the  same data by Giroud et al. found more strokes in women younger than age 35 years, and  concurrently more strokes in men older than age 45 years.  Therefore, consistency of age  break downs and avoiding wide age ranges are vitally important to ensuring comparability  between studies and teasing out sex differences by age.  

An assertion that young women may be disproportionately at risk of ischemic stroke  represents a significant departure from our current scientific understanding and may have  important implications about the etiology of ischemic strokes in young adults. Endogenous  estrogen is known to increase va so dilation and inhibit the response of blood vessels to  the development of atherosclerosis.  Hence, the prevalence of at hero sclerotic disease is  lower in pre menopausal women and rises in post menopausal women.  This phenomenon  

is thought to result in larger sex differences in myocardial infarction incidence in adults  younger than age 45 years, with more than double the incidence in young men compared  to young women.  We previously found that the rate of index acute myocardial infarction  was 1.6 times higher among men age 25 to 34 years (Figure 4) whereas the rate of index  ischemic stroke was 1.4 times higher among women in this age group.  Ischemic strokes  are often a sequela of at hero sclerotic disease and are subject to the same cardiovascular risk  factors as ischemic heart disease. The observation of a higher incidence of ischemic stroke in  pre menopausal women compared with men of the same age is therefore a departure from our  previous understanding. This finding suggests that the role of non-at hero sclerotic risk factors  (ie. maternal strokes, hormonal contraceptives,  migraine headaches 37 ) in young women  may be more important, yet poorly understood risk factors for ischemic stroke.  

We still do not know how much of this sex difference, especially in younger women,  is attributable to pregnancy associated strokes. One study found that maternal strokes  accounted for as much as  $18\%$   of all strokes in women age 12 to 35 years and   $1.4\%$   of  strokes in women 35 to 55 years. However, in addition to ischemic strokes, this study  included TIA, ICH, SAH, and cerebral venous thrombosis.  Overall, ischemic stroke and  TIA accounted for less than a quarter of these combined stroke events during pregnancy.  In the Helsinki Young Stroke Registry, which found proportionally more ischemic strokes  in women than men age 15 to 35 years, only  $2.6\%$   of women with ischemic strokes were  pregnant or postpartum.  More work is required to better understand how pregnancy and  sex differences among other thr ombo embo li c conditions (e.g., crypto geni c strokes with  concurrent patent foramen ovale) contribute to the development of different stroke types in  young adults.  

This study has several limitations. There is significant heterogeneity between studies, as  evidenced by the high  $\mathrm{I}^{2}$   values in our analyses. Some of this heterogeneity can be attributed  to study populations spanning different continents, including 15 different countries with  varying levels of development, race make up, ethnicities and cultures. Notably, the incidence  of ischemic strokes in young adults is higher among Black and Hispanic individuals. However, most studies do not report the incidence of strokes by race and ethnicity, so we  were unable to include this breakdown in our analysis. Heterogeneity may also be due  to methodological ly differing study designs, with the two main groups being prospective  with clinical stroke ascertainment or retrospective with stroke ascertainment based on  administrative algorithms. Even among these two subgroups, however, methods of clinical  and administrative case ascertainment varied. There were many more prospective than  retrospective studies, but retrospective studies collected more stroke cases overall. The  combined effect would favor the results from these larger studies, even though retrospective  studies did not always agree on the direction of the effect. Publication bias, a failure to  publish smaller studies, may affect our results. We did not exclude studies based on sample  size. However, larger epidemiological studies may not have published results in the younger  age groups due to the relatively small number of cases captured. This publication bias  may further reduce the sample size of prospective studies and skew the results towards  retrospective studies. Finally, heterogeneity in studies of young adult strokes may be related  to the heterogeneity of the disease itself, which may have more widely distributed etiologies  in the young adult population compared with stroke in older adults. Despite the limitations  of this data, this analysis included nearly 70,000 young adult stroke cases, many fold more  than previously evaluated in this age group. Caution is needed in interpreting our results  given the heterogeneous studies, but they do suggest the possibility of a different distribution  of stroke across sex in young adults.  

Experts in young adult stroke have highlighted the increasing contribution of traditional  vascular risk factors and the diminishing role of ‘rare’ risk factors including migraines,  oral contraceptives and pregnancy or postpartum.  There is no doubt that traditional  at hero sclerotic risk factors are a major contributor to ischemic strokes in both young men  and women, and become increasingly important with age. However, these risk factors are  less prevalent in younger women  and may not account for the observed higher incidence  of ischemic strokes in women younger than age 35. Young women who are survivors  of ischemic stroke also have worse outcomes with 2 to 3 times higher risk of poorer  functional outcomes compared to their male counterparts.  Sex differences among young  adults with ischemic stroke is a problem that demands attention. More research is needed  to better define the e tio logical sex differences of ischemic stroke in young adults and the  contributions that non-traditional risk factors such as pregnancy, postpartum, and hormonal  contraceptives play in the overall burden of ischemic strokes in young women.

# Figure 1.  

Age   ${<}35$   years, Incidence rate ratio(women/men) of ischemic strokes with  $95\%\mathrm{CI}$   for  different populations and overall effect. Analyses of overall effect were performed with  random effects models on the log of the ratio estimates. The combined ratios were estimated,  along with  $95\%\mathrm{CI}$   testing the null hypothesis of the IRR equaling one. \*Study weights were  calculated based on variability of the IRR.
