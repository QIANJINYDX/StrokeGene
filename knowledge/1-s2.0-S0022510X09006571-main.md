Stroke is the third largest cause of death and a major cause of adult disability and mortality worldwide. Experimental evidence suggests that genetic determinants do contribute a large part to stroke risk. The identi ﬁ cation of ph os ph odi est erase 4D gene as a risk factor for stroke caused a great deal of interest in stroke genetics. Many of the studies of  PDE4D  gene have focused on the original Icelandic  ﬁ ndings but the association between speci ﬁ c SNPs and haplotypes has been inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of three SNPs 32 (rs 456009), 83 (rs 966221) and 87 (rs 2910829), originally described by deCODE group; with stroke in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh. Two hundred and  ﬁ fty ischemic stroke patients and two hundred and  ﬁ fty controls were included in the study. The stroke patients were sub typed according to TOAST classi ﬁ cation. SNP 83 showed signi ﬁ cant association with stroke in the population under study while SNPs 87 and 32 were mono m orphic. Further SNP 83 was found to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with two stroke subtypes, intra cranial large artery atherosclerosis (the most frequent subtype in the population) and small artery occlusion. The association with other subtypes was found to be insigni ﬁ cant. Further, SNP 83 was found to be associated signi ﬁ cantly with some conventional stroke risk factors like diabetes and smoking.

promoters. The different  PDE4D  variants are expressed in various tissues including brain, lungs, kidneys, monocytes, B and T lymphocytes and vascular smooth muscles  [16] .  

Stroke or brain attack is the third largest killer in the world after heart attack and cancer  [1 – 3] . Studies involving twins, siblings and families suggest that stroke has a strong genetic component  [4,5] . Genetic causes of stroke range from classic Mendelian to complex. In recent years several parallels of research have been conducted to establish the relationship between the functional variants of a variety of genes and the risk of stroke. These include the angiotensin converting enzyme gene  [6,7] , the endo the li al nitric oxide synthase gene [8,9] , genes associated with in ﬂ ammation  [10] , thrombosis and coagulation  [11] , lipid metabolism and apo lipoprotein E  [12] . Most genetic determinants of stroke modulate the effects of known risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes etc.  

After Greta rs do ttir et al. identi ﬁ ed  PDE4D  gene as a susceptibility gene for stroke, attempts have been made to con ﬁ rmwhether this gene was also a susceptibility gene in other cohorts and populations  [13] .  

The association of  PDE4D  with stroke has not been investigated in any South Indian population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) SNP 32, 83 and 87 with ischemic stroke in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

A more recent and exciting discovery in this  ﬁ eld, is the identi ﬁ cation of ph os ph odi est erase 4D ( PDE4D ) gene which seems to contribute to the risk of stroke in carriers independent of other genetically based risk factors  [13] .  

# 2.1. Subjects  

Two hundred and  ﬁ fty ischemic stroke patients (males:females  $=$  188:62) presenting with new or recurrent stroke evaluated in the stroke clinic of Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad (A.P, India) between July 2007 and February 2009 were included in the study. Informed consent was obtained from all the subjects included in the study. The ethics committee of the study hospital approved the study. All the patients were examined by a quali ﬁ ed stroke neurologist and ischemic strokes were differentiated by computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. The ischemic  

PDE4D  is a large gene, which spans a 1.6 Mb region on 5q12 and has 24 exons  [14,15] .The gene can express nine different functional protein isoforms through alternative splicing or the use of differential  

stroke was classi ﬁ ed into subtypes according to the TOAST classi ﬁ cation  [17] .  

As a control group 250 healthy individuals matched for sex and age were recruited from the same demographic area. Information on demographic characteristics and risk factors were collected by using a structured questionnaire. Hypertension, alcoholism, diabetes and smoking were de ﬁ ned as reported previously  [7] .  

# 2.2. DNA isolation and genotyping  

A total of   $5\,\mathrm{{ml}}$   of venous blood was collected in EDTA tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform method. The speci ﬁ c regions containing these SNPs (32, 83 and 87) were ampli ﬁ ed by polymerase chain reaction  [18] .  

The ampli ﬁ ed PCR products were digested with restriction endon uc leases and the digested fragments were analyzed by gel electroph ores is  [18] . The polymorphism in SNP 83 was con ﬁ rmed by sequencing the PCR products. The sequencing was done by Chromus Biotech (Hyderabad, India). SNP 32 (go.59832491   $\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{C}.$  ), SNP 83 (go.59538277   $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{~T>C}}.$  ) and SNP 87 (go.59505656  $\scriptstyle\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{T}$  ) were digested with MSPA1I (New England Biolabs), TaiI fast digest ( Fermentas Life Sciences ) and SSP1 (New England Biolabs) respectively  [18] .  

# 2.3. Statistical analysis  

Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was  ﬁ rst tested for  PDE4D  gene polymorphism. Association between genotypes and stroke was examined by using odds ratio (or) with  $95\%$  con ﬁ dence interval (CI) and chi square analysis using EPI6 software (EPI info 6 CDC). All the statistical tests were two sided, and were considered signi ﬁ cant at  $P{<}0.05$  . Allelic frequencies were calculated according to the number of different alleles observed and the total number of alleles examined. Bonferroni correction was done for multiple comparisons.  

# 3. Results  

During the study period, 250 ischemic stroke patients and 250 controls were included in the study. The demographic features of the population under study have been listed in  Table 1 . When subjected to PCR analysis and restriction digestion none of the subjects was either heterozygous or homozygous for the SNPs 32 and 87.However, SNP 83 polymorphism (T/C) was found to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with the stroke while SNPs 32 and 87 were mono m orphic in the population under study. To con ﬁ rm the polymorphism, the PCR reaction products were sequenced ( Figs. 1 – 3 ). Greta s do ttir et al. have described the respective positions of these three SNPs in the  PDE4D  gene  [13] .  

The genotypic distribution of SNP 83 (rs 996621) and allelic frequency for T and C alleles in patients and healthy controls have been given in  Table 2 . Statistically signi ﬁ cant difference in the genotypic distribution and allelic frequency between the patients and healthy controls was observed   $(x^{2}\!=\!25.06.$  ,    $d\!f\!\!=\!2$  ;  $p{<}0.0001$   for genotypes;  $x^{2}\!=\!21.33,1\,d f\!=\!1$  ;  $p{<}0.0001$   for allelic frequency). The odds ratio for CC genotype and CT genotype as independent risk factors for ischemic stroke was 7.54 (  $95\%$   CI;   $2.53\substack{-23.23\,p\,<\,0.001\,}$  ) and 1.83 (CI  $95\%$  : 1.23 –

Ina further analysis of the association of SNP83 withstroke sub types classi ﬁ ed according to the TOAST classi ﬁ cation, we found a statistically signi ﬁ cant difference in the allelic frequency between patients having large artery intra cranial atherosclerosis and small artery occlusion ( Tables 3  and  4 ). As far as other subtypes are concerned, the association was found to be insigni ﬁ cant. The association of C allele with conventional risk factors for stroke was analyzed. The hypertensive s, diabetics, smokers and alcohol users showed a higher frequency of C allele in comparison with nor moten s ives, non-diabetics, non-smokers and non-alcoholics among the patient population. Bonferroni correction was done for these multiple comparisons. Although all the parameters survived this correction, the signi ﬁ cance was high for diabetes  $(p\!=\!7.379^{-\,08(\mathrm{P})})$   and smoking   $(p\!=\!1.988^{-\,06}$   (P) ) and borderline for hypertension and alcoholism   $\cdot p\!=\!0.019$   and 0.0125 respectively).  

# 4. Discussion  

PDE4D  is a large gene which spans a   $1.6\:\mathrm{Mb}$   region on 5q12 and bears 24 exons  [14,15] . It belongs to a super family of ph os ph o diesterases (PDE4 family) involved in the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Before the report by deCODE Genetics, the PDE4 gene family was never tested as candidate genes associated with any disease or

phenotype [19]. PDE4D gene codes for cAMP-speciﬁc  $3^{\prime}\ \ 5^{\prime}$ -cyclicph os ph odi est erase 4D, which seems to be a secondary signal pathway regulator of phenotype, with indirect effects on cardiovascular or stroke biomarkers  [20] .  PDE4D  degrades second-messenger cAMP which might be playing an important role in the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and macrophages, and therefore possibly in athero sclerosis and plaque stability  [21 – 25] .  

After Greta rs do ttir et al. identi ﬁ ed  PDE4D  gene as a susceptibility gene for stroke, more than a dozen follow up studies have been taken up to study the single nucleotide polymorphism across the  PDE4D gene for association with the disease. Cohorts of different ethnicities have been studied. A detailed account of all these studies has been already published  [5] . Recently Hsieh et al. have studied two SNPs

i.e. 87 and 41 from the gene in a Taiwanese population  [26] . No signi ﬁ cant association with ischemic stroke was found. A metaanalysis was carried out on 5200 cases and 6600 controls by Bevan et al.  [27] . They did not  ﬁ nd any genetic variant examined in  PDE4D , showing a robust and reproducible association to stroke. According to them any association that may exist seems to be weak and restricted to speci ﬁ c populations.  

In the present study we evaluated the association of three SNPs 83 (rs 966221), 32 (rs 456009) and 87 (rs 2910829) with ischemic stroke in an Andhra Pradesh population. To the best of our knowledge this is the  ﬁ rst study to investigate the association of  PDE4D  genetic variants with ischemic stroke in a South Indian population. All the three SNPs were found to be associated with stroke in an Icelandic population  [13] . As far as SNPs 32 and 87 are concerned, we did not  ﬁ nd any mutation in the subjects. These seem to be either mono m orphic or the mutations are very rare in the population under study. However, SNP 83 was found to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with the disease   $\scriptstyle\left.p<0.0001\right>$  ). Further, examining the association of this SNP with stroke subtypes, we found a signi ﬁ cant association with intra cranial large artery atherosclerosis and small artery occlusion (  $p{<}0.0001$   in each case).A Pakistani study also found SNP 83 to have a strong association with ischemic stroke  [18] . SNP 83 has been found to be associated with card i oem boli c stroke in an American population  [28] . Staton et al. have found a signi ﬁ cant association of SNP 83 with ischemic stroke in an Australian population  [29] . A recent study from North India also found SNP 83 to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with stroke in the North Indian population  [10] . In addition we found a strong association of C allele with diabetes and smoking and a marginal signi ﬁ cance with hypertension and alcoholism. Therefore diabetics and smokers bearing C allele in a high frequency are more predisposed to stroke.

The identi ﬁ cation of candidate genes such as  PDE4D  associated with stroke gives some hope that genetic studies might have a direct impact on the treatment of the disease. Moreover  PDE4D  and members of PDE4 family are characterized by selective inhibition by Rolipram  [30] . The selective inhibition of  PDE4D  using drugs might ultimately lead to the prevention of a stroke. Further studies will hopefully tell us how far the genetic information will assist to tailor clinical and therapeutic decision to an individual's genotype.  

In conclusion our results suggest that SNP 83 of  PDE4D  gene is signi ﬁ cantly associated with ischemic stroke in the South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh. Moreover, signi ﬁ cant association is found with intra cranial large artery atherosclerosis which is the most frequent subtype in this region  [31]  and small artery occlusion. This might be because the frequency of other subtypes is low in the study population. This is similar to previous report from the study hospital [31] . Most notable differences of the stroke registry of Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences were the predominance of intra cranial rather than extra cranial atherosclerosis and also the fact that other stroke subtypes which are quite frequent in western registries, are less frequent in the study population  [31] .
