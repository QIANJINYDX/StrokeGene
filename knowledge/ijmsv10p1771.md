# Abstract  

Background : Our previous studies have showed that the rs5888 single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP) in Scavenger receptor class B type 1 ( SCARB1 ) gene is associated with serum lipid levels  in the general Chinese populations. The present study was undertaken to detect the associations  between rs5888 SNP and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS).  

Methods : A total of 1,716 unrelated subjects (CAD, 601; IS, 533; and healthy controls, 582) were  included in this study. Genotyping of the rs5888 SNP were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism.  

Results : The genotypic frequencies of  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP were different between CAD patients  and controls, the subjects with TT genotype had high risk of CAD (  $\mathsf{Y O R}={\mathsf{I}}.76$  ,  $P=0.038$   for TT  vs .  CC; and  $\mathsf{O R}=1.75$  ,  $P=0.036$   for TT  vs . CC/CT). There was no significant association between  genotypes and the risk of IS. Further analysis showed that the subjects with TT genotype in the  total population had lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than the subjects with  CC/CT genotypes   $(P<0.05)$  , the subjects with TT genotype in controls but not in CAD or IS  patients had higher levels of serum LDL-C and ApoB than those with CC genotype (  $P<0.05$   for  each).  

Conclusions : The present study suggests that the  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP influences serum lipid  levels, and is associated with the risk of CAD.

# Introduction  

Among the non-communicable diseases, cardiovascular and circulatory diseases mainly comprising  ischemic heart disease   $(5.2\%)$  , hemorrhagic stroke   $(2.5\%)$  , ischemic stroke (IS,   $1.6\%$  ), and hypertensive  heart disease   $(0.6\%)$  , accounted for   $11.8\%$   of global  DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) [1]. Both coronary artery disease (CAD) and IS shared the common  risk  factors  such  as  hypertension,  diabetes,  

dys lipid emi a and metabolic syndrome [2], and the  common path o physiology mechanisms: at hero scl erosis [3]. Dys lipid emi a such as elevated serum levels of  total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apo lipoprotein  (Apo) B, or low levels of high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C) and ApoAI is one of the most  important modifiable risk factors for CAD [4,5] and IS  [6,7]. It is well known that the disorder of lipid metabolism is a complex trait resulted from multiple  environmental and genetic factors and their interactions [8,9].  

The Scavenger receptor class B type 1 ( SCARB1 ),  also as known as  SR-BI , is a HDL receptor which  binds HDL-C with high affinity, mediates selective  cholesterol uptake of   $\mathrm{{HDL},}$   and plays an important  role in reverse cholesterol translation [10]. Previous  studies have shown its importance in lipoprotein  metabolism and atherosclerosis in mouse models. In  targeted deletions of the murine  SR-BI  gene, TC levels  were significantly increased in homozygous    $S R–B I-/-$  mice, and analysis of the lipoprotein profiles by fast  protein liquid chromatography showed a significant  increase in HDL-C levels and a shift of the HDL particles to a larger size [11,12]. Inversely, lower plasma  levels and accelerated clearance of HDL and  non-HDL-C were found in  SCARB1  transgenic mice  [13]. In LDL receptor-deficient mice, attenuated expression of  SCARB1  was associated with increased  LDL-C and accelerated atherosclerosis [14,15]. The  association of several variants in the  SCARB1  gene  and serum lipid profiles has been reported in diverse  populations [16-28]. One of the single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  SCARB1  gene is rs5888  SNP, which was initially found by Acton [17], a  $"C"$   to  “T” substitution at cDNA position 1050 base position  on exon 8. The rs5888 SNP T allele has been associated  with increased serum HDL-C levels and decreased  risk of atherosclerosis related diseases [24-28]. In our  previous studies, however, we found that the rs5888  SNP T allele was associated with decreased HDL-C  levels and increased TC, LDL-C and ApoB levels in  three Guangxi populations [29,30]. Therefore, the aim  of the present study was to determine the associations  between rs5888 SNP and the risk of CAD and IS in the  Han Chinese.  

# Materials and methods  

# Patients and controls  

A total of 601 patients with CAD were recruited  from hospitalized patients in the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University. Coronary angiography was performed in all enrolled subjects. CAD  was defined as significant coronary stenosis  $(\geq50\%)$   in  at least either one of the three main coronary arteries  or their major branches (branch diameter   $\geq\,2\,\mathrm{\mm})$  ).  Subjects with congenital heart disease, car dio my opathy, valvular disease, autoimmune disease and type I  diabetes mellitus were excluded.  

A total of 533 patients with IS were also recruited  from hospitalized patients in our affiliated hospital.  All patients received strict neurological examination  and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. IS  was diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases (9 th  Revision). The patients with  transient ischemic attack (TIA), embolic brain infarc- tion, stroke caused by inflammatory diseases, cardioembolic stroke, autoimmune disease, serious chronic  diseases, as well as a past history of CAD have been  excluded from the study.  

A total of 582 healthy subjects matched by age,  gender, and ethnic group (Han Chinese) were also  recruited as a control group. The controls were judged  to be free of CAD, IS and other diseases by questionnaires, history taking and clinical examination.  

All enrolled individuals were Han Chinese from  Guangxi, People’s Republic of China. A standard  questionnaire was used to ascertain the general information and medical history for all participants. The  study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical  University. Informed consent was obtained from all  subjects after they received a full explanation of the  study.  

# Genotyping and biochemical analysis  

Venous blood sample was obtained from all  subjects after at least 12 hours of fasting. Genomic  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from peripheral  blood  leukocytes  using  the  phenol-chloroform method. Genotyping of the  SCARB1 rs5888 SNP was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism  [29,30]. The levels of serum TC, TG, HDL-C, and  LDL-C in samples were determined by enzymatic  methods with commercially available kits. Serum  ApoAI and ApoB levels were detected by the immuno turbid i metric immuno as say.  

# Diagnostic criteria  

The normal values of serum TC, TG, HDL-C,  LDL-C, ApoAI, ApoB levels, and the ratio of ApoAI to  ApoB in our Clinical Science Experiment Center were 

 3.10–5.17, 0.56–1.70, 0.91–1.81,   $2.70{-}3.20\ \ \mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L},$  1.00–1.78,   $0.63\mathrm{-}1.14~\mathrm{g/L},$   and 1.00–2.50; respectively 

 [29,30]. Hypertension was diagnosed according to the  criteria  of  1999  World  Health  Organiza- tion-International Society of Hypertension Guidelines  for the management of hypertension [31]. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as a systolic blood  pressure of  $140\:\mathrm{mmHg}$   or higher and a diastolic blood  pressure of   $90\,\mathrm{\mmHg}$   or higher. The subjects with  systolic blood pressure of only   $140~\mathrm{mmHg}$   or higher  but a diastolic blood pressure of   ${<}90~\mathrm{mmHg}$  were  diagnosed as having isolated systolic hypertension.  Normal weight, overweight and   obesity were defined  as a body mass index (BMI)   $<\,24$  , 24–28, and   $>28$   $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2},$  ; respectively [32].  

# Statistical analyses  

The statistical analyses were carried out using  the statistical software package SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc.,  Chicago, Illinois). The standard goodness-of-fit test  was used to test the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A  chi-square analysis was used to evaluate the difference in genotype distribution and sex ratio between  the groups. The general characteristics between patients and controls were tested by the Student’s unpaired   $t.$  -test. The association of genotypes and serum  lipid parameters was tested by analysis of covariance  (ANCOVA). Sex, age, BMI, blood pressure, alcohol  consumption, cigarette smoking were adjusted for the  statistical analysis. Odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression.   Meta-analyses were performed using STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corporation,  College Station, Texas, USA). A two-tailed  $P$    value less  than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  

# Results  

# General characteristics and serum lipid levels  

The baseline characteristics of the patients and  controls are shown in Table 1. The mean age, ratio of  males to females, serum LDL-C and ApoB levels, and  the percentages of subjects who smoked cigarette  were not different between controls and CAD or IS  patients (  $P>0.05$   for all). Compared with the control  group, the CAD patients had higher levels of average  BMI, pulse pressure and serum TG, and lower levels  of diastolic blood pressure, serum TC, HDL-C,  ApoAI, ApoAI/ApoB, and the percentages of subjects  who consumed alcohol   $(P\,<\,0.05–0.001)$  ). The IS pa- tients had higher levels of average BMI, systolic blood  pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and  serum TG, and lower levels of serum TC, HDL-C,  ApoAI, ApoAI/ApoB, and the percentages of subjects  who consumed alcohol   $(\mathrm{P}<0.05–0.001)$  .  

# Genotypic and allelic frequencies  

The genotypic and allelic frequencies of  SCARB1 rs5888 SNP are presented in Table 2. The genotype  distribution  was  concordant  with  the  Hardy-Weinberg proportions in both patients and controls (  $\textstyle P=0.114$   for CAD,  $P=0.339$   for IS, and   $P=0.210$  for controls). There was significant difference in the  genotypic frequencies between controls and CAD  patients   $(P<0.05)$  , but not between controls and IS  patients   $(P>0.05)$  ).  

# SCARB1 rs5888 SNP and the risk of CAD and  IS  

The subjects with TT genotype were associated  with increased risk of CAD   $\mathrm{{(OR}\;=\;1.76,\;95\%C I\;=}$  1.03-3.01 for TT  vs . CC;   $\mathrm{OR}=1.75,$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}=1.04–2.95$  for TT  vs .   $\mathrm{CC/CT})$  . There was no significant association between genotypes and the risk of IS (Table 2).

# Genotypes and serum lipid levels  

As shown in Table 3 and 4, the subjects with TT  genotype in the total population had lower serum  HDL-C levels than those with CT/CC genotypes (  $\'P=$  0.049). The subjects with TT genotype in controls but  not in CAD or IS patients had higher levels of serum  LDL-C and ApoB than those with CC genotype   $(P<$  0.05; Table 4).  

# Meta-analysis of the previous association  studies  

Previous  association  studies  between  the  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP and atherosclerosis related diseases are presented in Table 5. We performed a meta-analysis including three studies which had detailed  the genotype frequencies. The pooled OR and   $95\%C I$  were 0.737 (0.591-0.918) for TT  vs .   $\scriptstyle C C+C T$     $\left(P=0.007\right)$  ,  and 0.902 (0.764-1.064) for   $\mathrm{CT+TT}$    vs . CC (  $P=0.222)$  ),  and 0.919 (0.828-1.019) for   $\mathrm{T}$   allele  vs . C allele (  $\scriptstyle(P\;=$  0.108).  

# Discussion  

The results of several previous association  studies between the  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP and atherosclerosis related diseases are not entirely consistent in  different ethnic groups (Table 5). Ritsch et al. [26]  showed that the T allele of rs5888 SNP was associated  with decreased risk of peripheral arterial disease in  Austrians. The   T allele   carriers of the  SCARB1  rs5888  SNP in Tunisan reduced the risk of coronary stenosis  and increased serum HDL-C levels [27]. Recently, the  TT genotype of the  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP in male  Lithuanian aged 65-75 was also shown to decrease the  risk of CAD and increase serum HDL-C levels [28].  Two other studies in Korean and Spanish [24,25] did  not report the genotype frequencies, but they also  showed that the T allele or the T allele carrier was  associated with decreased CAD risk. In the present  study, however, we showed that the frequency of TT  genotype was higher in CAD patients than in controls.  The TT genotype was associated with increased risk  of CAD than the CC or CC/CT genotype. The TT  genotype was also associated with decreased serum  HDL-C levels in the total population. Meta-analysis  including three previous association studies showed  that the TT genotype was associated with decreased  risk of CAD. The reasons for the conflicting results  between our and previous studies are not well  known. One of the possible explanations was different  genetic background. According to the data of the Inter national HapMap project, the allelic frequencies of  the  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP in diverse racial/ethnic  groups are different. The frequencies of C and   $\mathrm{T}$  alleles were   $47.4\%$   and   $52.6\%$   in CEU (Utah residents  with ancestry from northern and western Europe), 

  $88.1\%$   and   $11.9\%$   in YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria), 

  $80.7\%$   and   $19.3\%$   in JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan), 

  $75.6\%$   and   $24.4\%$   in CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing,  China). In addition, the C-T change at exon 8 did not  affect its amino acid sequence of the protein. Therefore, the rs5888 SNP might be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a functional mutation in the  SCARB1 gene, and the LD pattern at this region is different  among populations. Accordingly, it is necessary to  further study on the associations of the  SCARB1 rs5888 SNP and atherosclerosis related diseases in  different ethnic populations.

The association between  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP  and serum lipid levels has been described in other  several previous studies, which were recently summarized by Stanis lov a it i ene et al. [28], and also discussed in our recent reports [29,30]. Some studies  showed that the  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP T allele was associated  with  increased  serum  HDL-C  levels  [16,18,20,24,27,28]   and decreased serum non-HDL-C  concentrations [17,20], and therefore has an atheroprotective effect. But other studies found that this  SNP T allele has a pro-atherosclerosis serum lipid  profile. Tai et al. [23] showed that the exon 8 (rs5888)  SNP  was  associated  with  increased  TC,  very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C),  LDL-C and TG levels in subjects with heterozygous  familial hypercholesterolemia. Morabia et al. [18] reported that the subjects with TT genotype had higher  levels of TC and LDL-C than the subjects with CC  genotype in females. Stanis lov a it i ene et al. [28] also  found that the TT genotype was associated with increased serum TC, TG and LDL-C levels in males. In  our previous studies, we observed that the TT genotype was associated with low serum HDL-C and  ApoAI levels in the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao, Mulao and  Han populations [29,30], and the T allele was associated with increased serum TC, LDL-C, and ApoB  levels in Bai Ku Yao females, and increased serum TG  and ApoB levels in Han males. In the present study,  we showed that the TT genotype was also associated  with increased serum LDL-C and ApoB levels in con

The relationship between the  SCARB1  gene and  serum lipid levels and atherosclerosis is complex and  inconsistent. Mice with attenuated expression of  SCARB1   displays  elevated  concentrations  of  HDL-C [11]. A study in women with hyper alpha lipo protein emi a also showed that the  SCARB1  protein  was inversely correlated with HDL-C levels and HDL  size [12]. A 11-base pair deletion mutation in the  promoter region of the  SCARB1  gene was associated  with increased plasma HDL-C levels in Chinese Taiwanese [21], which was consistent with several previous studies [16,18,20,24,27,28]. However, the results  of previous association studies between the  SCARB1 rs5888 SNP and atherosclerosis related diseases in  human were opposite with those in animal models.  SR-BI  knockout mice in the background of either  ApoE or LDL receptor deficiency have been shown to  accelerate atherosclerosis and increase LDL-C without  significant alterations in HDL-C levels, suggesting  that impaired LDL-C clearance may account for the  increased atherosclerosis relative to these mice [14,15].  In addition, the  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP was also associated with reduced  SCARB1  protein expression and  function  in vitro  [33]. Therefore, the possible mechanism of association between TT genotype of  SCARB1 rs5888 SNP and increased risk of CAD may be related  to the reduction in  SCARB1  protein expression resulting the increase in serum LDL-C and ApoB levels.  

# Study limitations  

There are several potential limitations of the  present study. Firstly, the drug information was  missing in some participants, so interference by drug  therapy could not be analyzed or excluded. Secondly,  the sample size of our study, especially the number of  the subjects with TT genotype was a bit small, which  might not have sufficient power to interpret the associations of the rs5888 SNP and the risk of diseases.  Therefore large study population with sufficient  power required to duplicate these results.  

# Conclusion  

The present study shows that the TT genotype of SCARB1  rs5888 SNP was higher in CAD patients than  in controls; the TT genotype was associated with increased risk of CAD. The levels of serum HDL-C in  subjects with TT genotype was lower than those in  subjects with CC/CT genotype in the total population, the subjects with TT genotype also associated  with increased serum levels of LDL-C and ApoB than  those with CC/CT genotype in controls. These suggest that the  SCARB1  rs5888 SNP influences serum  lipid levels, and is associated with the risk of CAD.
