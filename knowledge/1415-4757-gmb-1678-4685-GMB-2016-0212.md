# Abstract  

Cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), the receptor for CD154, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. Several studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of the CD40 rs1883832 polymorphism on at hero sclerotic disease in different population; however, inconsistent results were obtained. In this study, we investigated the association of four polymorphisms (rs1883832, rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459) of CD40 gene and their effect on CD40 expression with the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in a Chinese population. Three hundred and eighty patients with IS and 450 control subjects were included in the study. The CD40 polymorphisms were discriminated by Snapshot SNP genotyping assay. Serum soluble CD40 (sCD40) levels were detected by ELISA. We found that the rs 1883832 CT and rs 1883832 TT genotypes were associated with an increased risk of IS compared with the rs 1883832 CC genotype   $\mathsf{\backslash O R}=1.42$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.03–1.95,  $\mathsf{p}=0.030$   and   $\mathsf{O R}=1.91$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.29–2.82,  $P\!=\!0.001$  , respectively), and the rs1883832T allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of IS compared with rs1883832C allele   $(\mathsf{O R}=1.40$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.15–1.70,  $P=0.001$  ). Elevated serum sCD40 levels were observed in patients with IS compared with the control gropu   $(P<0.01]$  ). Individuals carrying the rs 1883832 TT or rs 1883832 CT genotypes showed significantly higher sCD40 levels compared with the rs 1883832 CC genotype in the IS group [  $(64.8\pm$   ${25.4~\mathsf{p g/m L}}$  ,   $\mathsf{T T}=94)$  );   $(63.9\pm24.3~\mathsf{p g/m L}$  ,  $\mathsf{C T}=185,$  ) vs   $(53.3\pm22.5~\mathsf{p g/m L}$  ,  $\mathsf{C C}=101$  ),  $P<0.01]$  ]. The TCCA haplotype was associated with an increased risk of IS compared with the control group   $\mathsf{\Omega R}=2.10$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.23–3.58,  $\mathsf{p}\,{=}\,0.005,$  ). However, we did not find a significant association between the other three polymorphisms and IS risk. In conclusion, after a comprehensive comparison with other studies, we confirmed that the rs1883832T allele but not the rs1883832C allele is associated with an increased risk of IS. The rs1883832 polymorphism may exert influences on abnormal CD40 expression in IS patients among the Chinese population.

# Introduction  

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and a common cause of long-term disability in the world (Feigin et al. , 2009, Lloyd-Jones  et al. , 2010). In China, there are approximately 2.5 million new strokes, and more than one million people die from stroke-related causes every year (Liu  et al. , 2011). Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most common type of stroke, accounting for more than   $80\%$   of cases (Liu et al. , 2011). Previous studies have identified that age and sex are closely related to IS (Lloyd-Jones  et al. , 2010; Turtzo and McCullough, 2010). Hypertension, smoking, alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia were demonstrated as important risk factors for IS (Sacco  et al. , 1997). However, these risk factors together explain only about  $50\%$   of the risk (Sacco  et al. , 1989), indicating that other factors such as immune, inflammatory and genetic factors may also be involved in the pathogen es is of IS. In the last few years, candidate genes for IS have been in  

tensely studied, and numerous susceptible candidates including CD40 gene have been found.  

CD40, the cost i mula tory receptor for CD40 ligand (CD40L/CD154), is a 48-kDa type I trans membrane protein receptor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily (Elgueta  et al. , 2009). Over expression of CD40 and/or its ligand CD40L have been detected in patients with atherosclerosis-related diseases such as coronary artery disease and stroke, and were suggested as potential biomarkers for predicting cardiovascular disease (Yan  et al. , 2002; Yan  et al. , 2004; Li  et al. , 2015). Binding of CD40L to its receptor in vascular endo the li al cells triggers the transcription of pro inflammatory and proatherogenic genes, which are important components in the onset of atherosclerosis-related diseases, including stroke (Chen et al. , 2006). It is accepted that atherosclerosis, plaque instability and thrombus are important pathological basis of IS.  In vitro , binding of CD40L to its receptor on the surface of endo the li al cells and smooth muscle cells leads to the activation of these cells, resulting in the expression of adhesion molecules, which is an initiating step of at hero genesis (Schonbeck and Libby, 2001; Schonbeck  et al. , 2002). Moreover, the interaction between CD40 and its ligand induces the expression of matrix metal lo protein as es (MMP), resulting in the degradation of interstitial collagen and the thin fibrous cap of atheromatous plaques, and eventually leading to the instability and rupture of plaques (Schonbeck and Libby, 2001). Furthermore, the CD40-CD40L interaction promotes the expression of tissue factors on macro- phage cells and endo the li al cells, leading to decreased thr ombo mod ul in expression, and favoring a local procoagulant and pro thr ombo tic status (Aukrust  et al. , 2004). These data indicate that CD40 might play a pathological role in IS, and it may be used as a biomarker and therapeutic target for IS. Hence, the CD40 gene is likely a potential candidate gene for IS risk.  

The gene encoding CD40 is located on 20q12-q13.2 in humans, which is consisted of 9 exons and 8 introns. The rs1883832 locus, previously demonstrated to be associated with CD40 expression, is located at the -1 position within the Kozak sequence (Jacobson  et al. , 2005; Tian  et al. , 2010). Several studies have investigated the association between rs1883832 polymorphism and risk of at hero sclerotic disease in different populations, however, the results were inconclusive (Yan  et al. , 2010; Wang  et al. , 2011; Ma  et al. , 2013; Zhang  et al. , 2013). To confirm the results, we con- ducted a case-control study with 380 IS patients and 450 control subjects. Moreover, three new polymorphisms (rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459) were added in this study. Until now, little information has addressed the effect of CD40 polymorphisms on CD40 expression and their effect on IS risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of these polymorphisms in the genetic basis of IS and to assess the relationship between CD40 polymorphisms and serum level of CD40 in a Chinese population.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Study population  

The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, and informed consent was obtained from all the IS patients and control subjects. The study population included 380 IS patients (290 men and 90 women, mean age:   $60.7\pm13.2$   years) and 450 control subjects (325 men and 125 women, mean age:   $63.9\pm10.3$   years). All IS patients were recruited from the Department of Neurology of the institution from May 2013 to December 2014. The control subjects were frequency-matched with the IS group on the basis of age and sex. All the control subjects were recruited from the physical examination center of the same hospital from July 2013 to December 2013. According to thorough clinical and laboratory evaluation, none of them were found to have any medical condition other than hypertension, diabetes, hyper cho lest erolemia or hyper trig lyc eridemia. All participants were Han Chinese and were consecutively selected from the same geographic region of Guangxi, China.  

IS patients were classified in accordance with the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification (Adams Jr  et al. , 1993) as large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), small-artery occlusion (SAO), cardioembolism or stroke of other determined etiology. Classifications were based on clinical findings, neuro imaging data [computed tomography (CT) and/or cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and results of diagnostic studies such as duplex imaging of extra cranial arteries, cardiac imaging (echo car dio graph y) and laboratory evaluation.  

Hypertension was diagnosed if the diastolic blood pressure was  $\geq90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   and/or the systolic blood pressure was  $\geq\,140\,\mathrm{\mmHg}$  , or if the person was currently using anti hypertensive treatment. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as fasting serum total cholesterol level  $>6.2\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$  , and hyper triglyceride mia was diagnosed if the fasting serum triglyceride level was  $>2.3\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$  .  

# DNA extraction and genotyping  

Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood leukocytes by using a salting-out method (John  et al. , 1991). Genotyping method was described in detail previously (Chen  et al. , 2015a). Briefly, SnapshotS NP geno typing assay was used to determine the genotypes of rs1883832, rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459 polymorphisms. PCR primers were designed in accordance with the GenBank reference sequence (accession no. NC_000020.11). Moreover, DNA sequencing method was used to confirm our genotyping results.  

# Serum sCD40 determination  

Serum samples from IS patients and control subjects were separated from venous blood at room temperature and stored at   $-70~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until use. Serum sCD40 levels were analyzed by enzyme linked immuno s or bent assay (ELISA) kits (Bender Med Systems, USA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Developed color reaction was quantified by an ELISA reader (RT-6000, China). The concentration of serum sCD40 was determined by using a standard curve constructed with the kit’s standards over the range of  $0{-}500\,\mathrm{ps/mL}$  .  

# Statistical analysis  

Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software program version 17.0. Continuous variables are displayed as mean  $\pm$   standard deviation (SD). If the data were normally distributed, the Student’s    $t$  -test was used. Categorical variables are reported as proportions and compared using the chi-square test. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested by the chi-square test. The Shi’s standardized coefficient   $\mathrm{D}'$   (D’) (Shi and He, 2005) was used to quantify the linkage d is equilibrium (LD) between polymorphisms. Haplotypes and their frequencies were estimated on the basis of a Bayesian algorithm using the Phase program (Stephens  et al. , 2001). The statistically significant criteria was assumed at  $P<0.05$   level.

# Clinical characteristics of the study participants  

The clinical characteristics of IS patients and healthy control subjects are shown in Table 1. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in age, gender, hyper triglyceride mia and hyper cholesterolemia   $(P>0.05)$  ). The frequencies of abnormal LDL-cholesterol, serum total cholesterol and triglycerides, smokers, diabetes and hypertension in IS patients were significantly higher than those in the control group   $(P<0.05)$  ). Increased levels of serum sCD40 were observed in IS patients com

Genotype and allele frequencies of the four polymorphisms  

All the four polymorphisms showed three genotypes according to sequencing results. The distribution of the genotype and allele frequencies of the rs1883832, rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459 polymorphisms in IS patients and control subjects are presented in Table 2. The genotype distribution of the four polymorphisms among IS patients and control subjects were in HWE. The frequencies of the rs1883832CC, rs1883832CT and rs1883832TT genotypes were 26.6, 48.7 and   $24.7\%$   in IS patients and 36.0, 46.4 and   $17.6\%$   in the control group, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of the rs1883832 polymorphism between IS patients and the control group   $(P<0.01)$  ). The

rs 1883832 CT and rs 1883832 TT genotypes were associated with an increased risk of IS compared with the rs 1883832 CC genotype   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.42$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.03–1.95,  $\mathsf{p}\,{=}\,0.030$   and  $\mathrm{OR}=1.91$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.29–2.82,  $P\,{=}\,0.001$  , respectively). Comparing with the rs1883832C allele, the rs1883832T allele was associated with an increased risk of IS   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.40$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.15–1.70,  $P=0.001$  ). However, there was no significant association between IS patients and the control group in the genotype and allele frequencies of the rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459 polymorphisms   $(P>0.05)$  ).  

# Genotype and allele distribution of the rs1883832 polymorphism in different populations  

Considering the importance of the CD40 rs1883832 polymorphism in the etiology of IS, we then performed a comparison of the genotype distribution of the rs1883832 polymorphism in different populations (Table 3), and found that the genotype distribution of rs1883832 polymorphism in our current study was significantly different from HapMap-CEU, HapMap-HCB, HapMap-JPT, HapMap- YRI, HapMap-ASW, HapMap-GIH, HapMap-LWK, HapMap-MKK and HapMap-TSI populations   $(P<0.05)$  . However, no significant difference was found when comparing with HapMap-CHB and HapMap-CHD populations  $(P>0.05)$  ).  

# Haplotype analysis of the four polymorphisms  

We further performed a haplotype analysis, and the possible seven haplotypes are listed in Table 4. The results showed that the rs1883832 polymorphism was in strong linkage d is equilibrium (LD) with the rs13040307   $\mathbf{(D'_{\alpha}=}$  0.873), rs752118   $(\mathbf{D}'=0.895)$  ) and rs3765459   $(\mathbf{D}^{\circ}=0.898)$  ) polymorphisms. Also, the rs13040307 polymorphism was in strong LD with the rs752118   $(\mathbf{D}^{\circ}\,{=}\,0.946)$  ) and rs3765459  $(\mathrm{D^{\circ}~=~0.937})$  ) polymorphisms. Moreover, the rs752118 polymorphism was in strong LD with the rs3765459   $(\mathbf{D}^{\ast}=$  0.942) polymorphism. CCCG and TCCG were the two major haplotypes, and accounted for 27.1 and  $44.1\%$  , and 30.6 and   $42.0\%$   in both IS patients and control subjects, respectively. As shown in Table 4, the TCCA haplotype was associated with an increased risk of IS compared with the control group   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.10$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.23–3.58,  $P=0.005]$  ).  

# Association between CD40 polymorphisms and serum sCD40 levels  

The rs1883832 polymorphism was significantly associated with serum sCD40 levels in patients with IS. Individuals carrying the r1883832TT   $(64.8\pm25.4\,\mathrm{ps}/\mathrm{mL})$  ,  $\mathsf{n}=94$  ) or rs 1883832 CT genotype  $(63.9\pm24.3~\mathrm{{ps/mL}}$ , $\mathsf{n}=185$ )showed significantly higher sCD40 levels compared with the rs 1883832 CC genotype   $(53.3\pm22.5\,\mathrm{ps}/\mathrm{mL}$  ,  ${\mathfrak{n}}=101,P$

Furthermore, there was no significant association between the CD40 rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459 polymorphisms and serum sCD40 levels   $(P>0.05)$  ).  

# Clinical and biochemical values in IS patients with different CD40 genotypes  

No significant difference was found in the genotype frequencies of the CD40 rs1883832, rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459 polymorphisms after stratification of IS by age, smoking status, gender, and the absence or presence of hyper triglyceride mia, hypertension and hyper cholesterolemia (data not shown). Moreover, no significant difference was found between different genotypes of the CD40 polymorphisms and laboratory values (TG, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C) (data not shown).  

# Association between CD40 polymorphisms and different subtypes of IS  

We did not find any association between the CD40 polymorphisms rs1883832, rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459 and IS subtypes (data not shown).  

# Discussion  

In this study, we analyzed the effect of four polymorphisms in CD40 gene on IS risk and their effect on CD40 expression in a Chinese population. Our results indicated that the rs1883832 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of IS. The increased risk was also found in haplotype analysis. Moreover, we found that the rs1883832 polymorphism was associated with increased CD40 expression compared with the control group. The statistical power of the study was calculated to be  $82\%$   to detect the association between rs1883832 polymorphism and IS risk in a sample size of 830 participants (380 in IS group and 450 in the control group) assuming an OR of 1.5 and  $\upalpha$   of 0.05 (NCSS PASS 11 software, version 11.0.7). Therefore, this finding indicates that the rs1883832 polymorphism may play a crucial role in the etiology of IS.  

Atherosclerosis is a major cause of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke. It is accepted that interactions between CD40 and its ligand CD40L are closely involved in the pathogen es is of inflammation, atherosclerosis and thrombosis (Anand  et al. , 2003, Antoniades  et al. , 2009). Up regulation of CD40 and/or CD40L have been detected in serum/plasma/cell surface of patients with IS by several studies, and were suggested to be useful predictors and biomarker for stroke (Cha  et al. , 2003; Garlichs  et al. , 2003; Ishikawa  et al. , 2005; Davi  et al. , 2009; Zhang  et al. , 2014; Li  et al. , 2015; Wang  et al. , 2015). However, the exact mechanism of how CD40 is up regulated, and how the up regulated CD40 affects IS patients have not been fully elucidated. Garlichs  et al.  (2003) reported that patients with acute cerebral ischemia show up regulating CD40-CD40L system expression and may contribute to a proinflammatory, pro a the rogen ic and pro thr ombo tic milieu. Very recently, Wang  et al.  (2015) investigated the association between sCD40L and carotid plaque in patients with acute ischemic stroke and found that sCD40L levels were significantly associated with carotid plaque formation and instability, suggesting that sCD40L may be a useful predictor for plaque formation and instability in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In this study, we demonstrated that serum sCD40 levels were significantly elevated in patients with IS compared with the control group. Moreover, we found that the rs1883832 polymorphism was associated with an increased serum sCD40 levels in patients with IS compared

Figure 2  - Association between the CD40 rs1883832 polymorphism and sCD40 levels in IS patients. sCD40 levels were significantly lower in IS patients with rs1883832CC genotype than in rs1883832TT and rs 1883832 CT genotypes. However, there were no significant differences in sCD40 levels between the rs 1883832 CT and TT genotypes.  

with the control group. Genotypes carrying the rs1883832T allele were found to be associated with increased serum sCD40 levels compared with the rs 1883832 CC genotype in patients with IS. We speculated that the rs1883832 polymorphism may be associated with IS by up-regulating CD40 expression, which has been demonstrated to play a major role in atherosclerosis formation, plaque destabilization, thrombosis and the initiation of inflammatory response.  

Several studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of the CD40 rs1883832 (-1C/T) polymorphism on at hero sclerotic disease, however, the results were controversial. Yan  et al.  (2010) reported that the rs 1883832 CC genotype and the rs1883832C allele in the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) group were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the rs1883832C allele was found to associate with an increased risk of ACS when compared with the control group   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,1.88}$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.40–2.52). Similarly, a case-control study conducted by Wang  et al.  (2011) found that the frequency of rs1883832C allele in the ACS group was significantly higher than those in the control group   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.55$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.15–2.11,  $P<$  0.05), and individuals carrying the rs 1883832 CC genotype showed a significantly increased CD40 and CD40L expression compared with the rs 1883832 CT and rs 1883832 TT genotypes carriers   $(P<0.05)$  . In contrast, Ma  et al.  (2013) reported that the frequencies of CT and  $\mathrm{TT/CT}$   genotypes of rs1883832 polymorphism in the IS group were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the rs1883832T allele was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of IS   $(\mathrm{OR}\ =\ 1.27\$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\ =$  1.02–1.59). Moreover, they also found that the frequency of genotypes carrying the rs1883832T allele was higher in patients with history of stroke compared with those without

 (for TT:  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,6.54$  ,  $95\%\mathrm{CI}=1.66–25.83$  ; for TT/CT:  $\mathrm{OR}=$  3.47,  $95\%\mathrm{CI}=1.03{-}11.67\$  ). Similarly, Zhang  et al.  (2013) reported that the frequencies of TT genotype and T allele of the CD40 rs1883832 polymorphism were significantly higher in patients with cerebral infarction than those in the control group   $(P<0.05)$  . The rs 1883832 TT genotype was suggested to be associated with an increased CD40 mRNA expression and CD40L plasma concentration   $(P<0.01)$  ). Subsequently, a meta-analysis was conducted (Yun  et al. , 2014) and found that rs1883832C allele was significantly associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, ACS and atherosclerosis, whereas the rs1883832C allele was demonstrated to be associated with a decreased risk of IS.  

Consistent with the results of Ma  et al.  (2013) and Zhang  et al.  (2013), in this study we found that the frequencies of the T allele, the TT and CT genotypes of CD40 rs1883832 polymorphism predicted a significantly higher IS risk compared with the control group (Table 2). A possible explanation for the inconsistencies between the rs1883832 polymorphism and different types of atherosclerotic diseases is that this polymorphism might have different genetic effects on different diseases. Similar results can been seen in the studies of Chen  et al.  (2015b) and Yi  et al.  (2014), in which they found that the impacts of genetic polymorphisms may be different according to the types of cancer.  

Until now, very little information has been reported on the association of CD40 rs752118 and rs3765459 polymorphisms and disease susceptibility. Moreover, no data has been reported on the association between the rs13040307 polymorphism and disease susceptibility. Previous studies conducted by Wu  et al.  (2016) and Wagner  et al.  (2015) have tried to assess the association of rs752118 polymorphism with systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis, respectively, but failed to obtain a positive result. Regarding the rs3765459 polymorphism, data from Shuang et al. (2011) demonstrated that the rs3765459A allele was higher in patients with breast cancer compared with the control group   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,1.22\$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.03–1.45,  $P=0.025$  ). However, the study conducted by Burdon  et al.  (2006) found that the rs3765459 polymorphism was significantly associated with a decreased risk of coronary artery calcification in diabetic families. Furthermore, rs3765459 has also been assessed in relation to systemic lupus erythematosus (Wu  et al. , 2016) and asthma (Hsieh  et al. , 2009), but a significant association was not detected.  

In this study, we investigated the association between rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459 polymorphisms and risk of IS, but found no significant association. The reason for these negative results remain unknown, but two possibilities should be considered. First, it may be because of genetic trait differences, as we know that genetic polymorphisms in human genes are distinct in different ethnicities, populations and geographic regions. Data from Table 3 can support this viewpoint, as it shows that the genotype distribution of rs1883832 polymorphism in our study were significantly different from HapMap-CEU, HapMap-HCB, HapMap-JPT, HapMap-YRI, HapMap-ASW, HapMap- GIH, HapMap-LWK, HapMap-MKK and HapMap-TSI populations, but similar with HapMap-CHB and HapMapCHD populations. In addition, IS is a multi-factorial disease, thus, individual exposure to diverse environmental factors and genetic background may cause different results.  

Several limitations should be considered in our study. First, a relatively small sample size of the study may have limited the statistical power of the analysis. Second, as our study population was all Chinese, the results cannot be directly applied to other ethnic groups. Third, our study was designed as a hospital-based and case-control study, and the control subjects were not selected from general population, thus, we cannot exclude the possibility of selection bias. Finally, the limitation of the assay kit may also contribute to the distinction of the results.  

# Conclusions  

After a comprehensive comparison with other studies, we found that the rs1883832T allele but not the rs1883832C allele is associated with an increased risk of IS. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time that the rs13040307, rs752118 and rs3765459 polymorphisms in CD40 gene were not associated with IS in the Chinese population. Further study with a larger sample size is needed to confirm our results, especially in different ethnic groups.
