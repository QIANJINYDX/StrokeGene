Abstract:   Background:  Pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been suggested as modifying risk for  atherosclerosis. Promoter region genetic polymorphism of IL-10 gene is known to be associated with the level  of IL-10 production. Through these effects, they might be involved with the ischemic stroke (IS). Our aim  was to assess the nature of the functional polymorphisms in IL-10 promoter and any links with IS in Chinese  Han population.  Methods:  The IL-10 -1082   $\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  ,   $\mathrm{-819~C>T}$   and   $\mathrm{-}592\mathrm{\C>A}$   functional polymorphisms were  determined by TaqMan SNP Genotyping assays in 1296 subjects (648 IS patients diagnosed by CTs or/and  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 648 normal healthy controls from Chinese Han Population). Multivariate  logistic regression analysis was used to show the association between the IL-10 genotypes and the IS events.   Results:  We found that the CC genotype of   $\mathrm{-819~C>T}$   was more common in controls than IS subjects   $(\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$  ,  corrected for multiple testing) in the Han population. CC carriage may be associated with the decreased risk of  IS in the Han ethnic group (OR 0.65,   $95\%$   CI 0.43-0.97). In addition, the CC genotype in   $-592\mathrm{\C}$   and GG  genotype in   $\mathrm{-}1082\ \mathrm{G{>}A}$   are all extremely low in Chinese Han cases and controls.  Conclusions:  The G allele  frequency at the -1082 promoter region of IL-10 was rare in Chinese Han population which are diffierent from  American/European populations..  $\mathrm{IL-10-819\,C>T}$   may be an independent protective factor for IS in the Chinese  Han population.  

Key words:  Ischemic stroke, IL-10, functional polymorphisms, Han population, case-control.  

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS), a common multi factor neurological  disease with a variety of etiologies affected by a number of  genetic mutations and environmental factors, is manifested  by atherosclerosis or gradual cholesterol deposition. Chronic  low-grade inflammation and activation of the innate immune  system are closely involved in the pathogen es is of IS (1).  Mounting evidences from in-vivo studies -vivo studies showed  that inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the  development of IS. Cross-sectional studies have provided  support for the hypothesis that chronic sub clinical inflammation  may be associated with atherosclerosis and precede the  progression of clinically overt IS (2, 3).  

Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a cytokine with both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions, is thought to be  involved in the down regulation of cell-mediated and cytotoxic  inflammatory responses by down regulating the synthesis of  pro inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6  and tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNF $\upalpha$  ) (4). IL-10 also  down regulates the human leukocyte antigen II expression in  antigen-presenting cells, and inhibits the proliferation and  cytokine production of T cells responding to an antigen (5). The  pro inflammatory properties of   $\mathrm{II}\!\cdot\!10$   is mainly mediated by its  ability to promote   $\mathrm{{IFN-}\gamma}$   production by natural killer cells in  addition to B-cell proliferation and antibody production (6).  

Twin and family studies have suggested that about   $75\%$  of the level of IL-10 production is genetically determined  (7). IL-10 gene expression is largely depended on three  SNPs located in the promoter -592, -819 and -1082 and the  haplotypes composed  of them. These SNPs form haplotypes  have been associated with high or low level production of  IL-10. Several studies done on IL-10 promoter polymorphisms  suggest that IL-10 maybe associated with the risk of  atherosclerosis , and other inflammatory diseases (8-13).  However, the association of genetic polymorphisms of IL10  with IS remains poorly understood.  

Based on these, our aim of the study was to determine  whether the promoter region polymorphism of   $\mathrm{IIL10{-}1082\,G{>}A}$  ,   $\mathrm{-}819\;\mathrm{C>T}$   and   $\mathrm{-}592\;\mathrm{C}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{A}$   are associated with IS in the Chinese  Han population and to procure wider genetic inferences of locus  effects across Caucasians and black persons with different  geographic origins and lifestyles.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study subjects  

Our study was approved by the Institutional Review Board  of Hubei Center for Disease Controls and Prevention, and  signed informed consents were obtained from all participants  or from patients’ representatives if direct consent could not  be obtained. The experiment methods were carried out in  

# IL-10 POLYMORPHISMS AND ISCHEMIC STROKE  

accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations, and  all experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional  Review Board of Hubei Center for Disease Controls and  Prevention. We enrolled inpatients attending the Stroke Unit of  five large general hospitals (Fixed stroke research institutions)  in Shenzhen, He in ong jiang in recent seven years.  

A total of 648 typical Han subjects presenting with IS were  enrolled into the case-control study. The diagnosis of IS was  established according to the World Health Organization, and  TOAST classification (39, 40). All stroke cases was first-ever  IS determined by physical examination and head imaging  (CT or MRI). Concurrently, 648 age-, gender- and ethnicitymatched normal healthy controls were selected from healthy  volunteers by stratified random cluster sampling from four local  community-based populations. Subjects with a history of stroke,  Alzheimer’s disease, brain aneurysm, dementia, dystonia,  Parkinson’s disease or inflammatory disorders were excluded  from the control group. A structured questionnaire was used to  record general information, clinical history of IS and associated  clinical parameters, and epidemiological data.  

# Genotyping of candidate genomic variants  

We determined the genotypes of two polymorphisms by  TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (ABI Assays-on-Demand)  to assess any links with IS. Details regarding genomic DNA  isolation and genotyping procedures as well as quality control  programs are available in previous studies (41-44).  

# Biological variable determination  

Fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), total  protein (TP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density  lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides (TG) were assayed using  standard laboratory procedures in the clinical laboratory.  

# Statistical analysis  

Allele frequencies, genotype frequencies and carriage  rates for the alleles in all groups were compared by Fisher’s  exact test with SPSS software package SPSS12.0 (SPSS Inc.,  Chicago, Illinois, USA). Data on quantitative characteristics  were expressed as mean   $\pm\nobreakspace{\cal S}\mathrm{D}$  . Comparisons between groups  were made with the   $\chi2$   test (nominal data) or Student’s t  test (interval data). Forest plots were carried out using the  Stata software 10.0 (STATA Corp, College Station, Texas).  Pairwise linkage d is equilibrium (LD) between SNPs were  estimated as   $\mathbf{D}^{\prime}$   and r2 using Haploview version 3.0 (http:// www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/). All genotype data for  each sample were then taken to infer the haplotypes by using  the PHASE 2.0 program (http://www.stat.washington.edu/ stephens/software.html), haplotypes were estimated using an  accelerated expectation-maximization algorithm, which gives  highly accurate population frequency estimates of the phased  haplotypes based on the maximum likelihood as determined  from the unphased input. Haplotype data were then subject to  permutation analysis (with 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations)  using Haploview software.  

# Results  

# Demographic and clinical characteristics  

A total of 648 IS patients and 648 healthy controls were  evaluated for the IL-10 polymorphisms study from Han subject  panel of China. The ratio of males to females was 379:269 in  the Han subjects. There were no significant differences in age  between cases and controls in study populations   $(\mathrm{P=}0.102)$  .  There was a significant difference in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)  between the patients and controls in the Han population   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.000})$  . There were no significant difference in body mass  index (BMI)   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.010})$   and WHR   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.000})$  ) between the  patients and controls in the Han population. The results suggest  that hypertension and WHR increased the risk of IS in Han  ethnic group. As shown in Table 1, the Han IS group had a  higher prevalence of conventional risk factors for vascular  diseases, including a WHR, history of hypertension, diabetes,  smoking compared to the Han control group. The results  suggest that BMI, WHR, hypertension, diabetes, smoking may  increase the risk of IS. However, there was a trend for Alcohol  drinking, Tea drinking and HDL-C to be protective factors for  IS [Table 1].

# Allelic association analysis between the three SNPs in the  Promoter of IL-10  

We analyzed the linkage d is equilibrium (LD) patterns among   $\mathrm{IL10\!-\!1082\G\!>\!A}$  ,   $^{-819}\mathrm{~C>T~}$   and   $\mathrm{-}592\,\mathrm{\C>A}$  . The data were  derived from the genotyping data of the Han IS (Fig.1.a, c,)  and control (Fig.1.b, d,) population, respectively. The pairwise  correlations among SNPs were measured as   $\mathrm{D^{\prime}}$   (Fig.1.a, b,) or  r2 (Fig.1.c, d,) and are shown in each diamond of Fig. 1. All  pairwise LD measures  $\mathbf{D}'$   for these three investigated SNPs are  ranged from 0.17 to 0.97, whereas r2 ranged from 0.01 to 0.71.  All the data show that IL-10-819   $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{>}^{\prime}$  T(rs1800871) and IL-10-  $592\mathrm{~C}{>}\mathrm{A}(\mathrm{rs}1800872)$   are in middle linkage d is equilibrium   $(0.66\leq\mathrm{r}2\leq0.71$  ,   $0.94\!\le\!\mathrm{D}^{\circ}\!\le0.97)$   in the Han patients and  controls. However,   $\mathrm{IL}{-}10{-}1082\ \mathrm{G{>}A}$   (rs1800896) and IL-10-  $819\ \mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{T}(\mathrm{rs}1800871)$   are suggested to be in extremely low  linkage d is equilibrium   $(0.01\leq\mathrm{r}2\leq0.06,0.17{\leq}\mathrm{D}^{\circ}{\leq}\,0.37)$  .

The pairwise  correlations between SNPs were measured as  $\mathbf{D}'$   (a, b) or r2 (c,  d) and are shown   $(\times100)$   in each diamond  

![](images/6215307a3f3dc4e9b04712aaf361bc6ffd2e5e1243f6f2e3b2bef139824a981d.jpg)  

Table 2 shows the distribution of genotypes and allelic  frequencies for   $\mathrm{IL}{-}10\ \mathrm{-}1082\ \mathrm{G{>}A}$  ,   $\mathrm{-819~C>T}$   and   $\mathrm{-}592\mathrm{\C>A}$    polymorphisms. For each genotype frequency of the three  SNPs, there was no significant difference in   $\mathrm{-}1082\ \mathrm{G{>}A}$   and   $.592\mathrm{~C}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{A}$   genotype distribution between either IS or controls  in the Han ethnic group. It is worth noting that the CC genotype  in   $-592\;\mathrm{C}{>}\mathrm{A}$   and GG genotype in   $\mathrm{-}1082\;\mathrm{G{>}A}$   are all extremely  low in cases and controls which are different from observed  previously in American/European populations (20-22).  

However, there were significant differences in the  distribution of   $\mathrm{-819~C>T}$   polymorphism between the patients  and controls in the Han group   $_{(\mathrm{P}<0.05)}$  . The Han patient  group had an decreased frequency of CC genotype compared  to the Han control group. With TT as the reference genotype,  IL-10-819 CC had an odds ratio for IS of 0.67   $_{(\mathrm{P}<0.05)}$   in Han  people. After adjustment for con founders, there was still a more  significant difference in carriage rate of CC genotype among  patients and controls using a multivariate logistic regression  model   $_{({\mathrm{P}}<0.05)}$   [Table 2]. The   $\mathrm{IL-10-819~C>T}$   polymorphism  was Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in Han ethnic groups   $_{\mathrm{(P>0.05)}}$  . This suggests that IL-10 gene promoter   $\mathrm{-819~C>T}$    polymorphism may be an independent protective factor for IS  in Hans.  

Furthermore, we also analyzed the association of BMI,  WHR, FBG of IS patients with   $\mathrm{-819~C>T}$   genotypes, however,  we failed to find any significant association with any of these  parameters in Han population (all  $\mathrm{P{>}0.05}$  ) [Fig 2].

# Haplotype associations with IS risk  

An extended SNP haplotype structure analysis was  conducted, which may provide some insights into the  relationship between SNP patterns and IS that is beyond what  single point SNP analysis can reveal. A total of five main– frequency haplotypes were estimated in the IS and control  groups using Haploview software to reconstruct haplotypes  based on the observed genotypes. No risk haplotype was found  in the cases and controls [Table 3].  

# Discussion  

The studies done on IL-10 in IS are conflicting or  inconsistent. Several studies have demonstrated that IL-10  may decrease the risk of atherosclerosis or the risk for  IL-10 POLYMORPHISMS AND ISCHEMIC STROKE  

Table 2   Association between SNPs and risk of IS between cases and controls for Chinese Han population

acute coronary heart disease (21, 22), but this conclusion  is not uniform (23). The genotypes or haplotypes of IL-10  associated with high IL-10 levels have been suggested to  decrease the risk for atherosclerosis (24), meanwhile, those  genotypes with low IL-10 production have been associated  with an increased risk for atherosclerosis (25, 26). However,  opposite or neutral effects of these polymorphisms have been  reported (27-31). As it is, researchers have raised IL-10 may  also have therapeutically perspectives, as in recent studies,  the IL-10 -1082 A/G polymorphism is associated with IS  susceptibility in Asians and the 1082 A allele associated with  low capacity to produce IL-10 could significantly increase  the risk of IS in Asians too (32). However, the validity of the  association has remained controversial. Replications in as  many populations as possible are essential for establishing  the credibility of the locus-specific contribution. The Han  population, a majority group accounting for   $19\%$   of the total  world population, is the nationality with the largest population  in the world (33). In the previous replication studies, we have  conducted gene association studies and found some interesting  results in this unique population (34-36). Our aim of the study  was to determine whether the   $\mathrm{LL}\mathrm{-}10\mathrm{~}\mathrm{-}1082\mathrm{~}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{A}$  ,   $\mathrm{-819~C>T}$   and   $.592\ \mathrm{C}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{A}$   SNPs are associated with IS in this Chinese unique  population and to procure wider genetic inferences of locus  effects across European and Indian population with different  geographic origins and lifestyles.

Table 3 Association between haplotypes (rs1800871, rs1800872 , rs1800896) and IS 
![](images/b6b85f965bc97717a2d5bcd6a536ea7adb5c3f7777e8ce073a3e3739a7c8bc32.jpg)  
\*Polymorphism from left to right the SNPs are rs1800872, rs1800871, rs1800896, All those haplotypes frequency   ${<}0.01$   will be ignored in analysis; a. Observed, nominal P value; b.  Empirical, permutation P value calculated using 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations.  

Despite these encouraging findings, our study analyzed  well-characterized IS patients and controls within Chinese  Han ethnic population. We failed to find   $\mathrm{LL\!-\!10\cdot\!1082\G\!>\!A}$    and   $-592\mathrm{\C}$   SNPs that are associated with IS. However, we  found a significant association of   $\mathrm{IL-10\-819\C>T}$   with IS,  after adjusting for con founders, suggesting that the IL-10 -819  CC genotype does affect the IS susceptibility more significant.  In addition, the G allele of   $\mathrm{-}1082\ \mathrm{G{>}A}$   and the CC genotype  of   $\mathrm{-}592\;\mathrm{C}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{A}$   are all extremely low we report here which were  different from European and African populations but similar  to Japanese and Indian population (37-39). The reason for the  rarity of these genotypes in the Chinese population is unclear  and needs further ethnicity-specific studies.  

The potential mechanism of this observed association may  be explained as that rs1800871 may influence the regulation of  the production of IL-10 and thus involve in the development of  IS. An extended twin study found that   $50–70\%$   of the variants  in IL-10 gene variants affect plasma levels of IL-10 were  genetically determined (40-42). A recent small-sample study  had shown that serum of IL-10 was significantly higher in the  population with C allele of rs1800871 than in the population   $\mathrm{T}$  with  allele (42-45). Thus, although we found the haplotypes  of three functional variants maybe not associated with IS  significantly, our current study suggest that   ${-819\,\mathrm{C}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{T}}$   maybe an  important genetic marker that may predisposes people to IS.  

Strengths of the current study are a relative large sample size  in the Han population, rigorous methods used to diagnose IS  including formal assessment of the reliability of interpretations  of head CTs or MRI findings, and a biologically plausible a  priori rationale for choosing the candidate genes. Our study  also has some limitations. First, it is a case-control study and  a selection bias could not be completely excluded for the  group of patients with IS. Second, although controls with  diseases potentially related to ischemic disorders were debarred  from entry to the study, there may have been enrollees with  undiagnosed disease, so a selection bias cannot be categorically  excluded. Third, it is possible that our findings might apply  

# only to the Chinese population.  

In general, we found that the CC genotype in   $\mathrm{-}592\;\mathrm{C}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{A}$   and  GG genotype in   $\mathrm{-}1082\mathrm{~G{>}A}$   are all extremely low in Chinese  Han cases and controls which are different from American and  European populations. The   $\mathrm{IL}{-}10{-}592\mathrm{~C}{>}\mathrm{A}$   and   $\mathrm{-}1082\mathrm{~G{>}A}$  are unlikely to contribute significantly to a susceptibility to, or  affect the progression of IS in Han population. Moreover our  findings lend support to the notion of an independent protective  effect of the CC genotype of the   $\mathrm{LL{-}10\ {-}819\ C{>}T}$   on the risk  of IS in the Han population. Further explorations with larger,  more ethnically diverse populations are warranted to better shed  light on the functional properties of this receptor on the risk of  IS, as well as the complicated path-physiological mechanisms  precisely. These insights may affect the diagnosis and treatment  of IS.
