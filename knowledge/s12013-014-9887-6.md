Published online: 16 March 2014  $\copyright$   Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014 Abstract The objective of this study is to investigate the association between SNP polymorphisms of endothelin-1 (EDN1) and endothelin receptor (EDNRA and EDNRB) gene and ischemic stroke (IS) in the Chinese Han population in northern. A case–control study was introduced. We genotyped eight SNPs (rs1800541, rs2070699, and rs5370 in EDN1 gene; rs1801708, rs5333, and rs5335 in EDNRA gene; and rs3818416 and rs5351 in EDNRB gene) and calculated their polymorphic distribution in control group, IS group, and the IS subgroups. In male population, EDN1 gene rs2070699 G allele increased the incidence risk to 1.78 times   $P=0.009$  ; OR 1.78;   $95~\%$   CI 1.15–2.75) and the risk of morbidity of rs5370 T allele carrying increased to 1.49 times   $\textstyle P=0.048$  ; OR 1.49;   $95~\%$   CI 1.00–2.21). EDNRA gene mutation rs5335 homozygous CC morbidity risk was sign i cant ly lower   $\textstyle P=0.016$  ; OR 0.52;   $95~\%$   CI 0.31–0.88). In the female population, the mutant homozygous AA cancer risk was sign i cant ly higher than G allele carriers   $P=0.019$  ; OR 2.65;   $95~\%$   CI 1.18–6.00) on EDNRA gene rs1801708. In EDN1 gene, T allele of rs5370 and G allele of rs2070699 may be IS incidence risk factors in Northern Han male population. A allele of rs1801708 in EDNRA gene can increase the risk of IS in Northern Han women population.

# Introduction  

In 1988, the Japanese scholar Yanagisawa et al. [ 1 ] and others isolated and puriﬁed an active peptide from porcine aortic endo the li al cell culture medium, named endothelin (endothelin, EDN). Endothelin composed of 21 amino acid residues, there are three forms EDN-1, EDN-2, and EDN-3, is by far the strongest found va so constriction. Endothelin widely exists in vivo. First, endothelin converting enzyme (endothelin converting enzymes, ECE) converts the big endothelin to peptides with biological activity, and then through two G protein-coupled receptors endothelin receptor A (EDNRA)- and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB)-mediated biological effects in the body complete. Usually, we collectively referred EDN, EDNRA, EDNRB, and ECE to as endothelin system (Table  1 ).  

By molecular biology techniques and p harm a co logical inhibition of EDN system, the ﬁrst clinical results show that EDN-1 maintains cardiovascular balance in vivo. Furthermore, EDN-1 plays an important role in functional and structural changes in the arteries, such as hypertension, glomerular sclerosis, atherosclerosis, heart failure, and so on [ 2 ]. Studies have shown that EDN-1 of rs5370 (Lys198Asn) polymorphism was associated with hypertension [ 3 ], body mass index [ 4 ], levels of high-density lipoprotein of patients with coronary heart disease [ 5 ] and ischemic stroke [ 6 ], and so on. rs1800541 polymorphism had relationship with asthma in Britain and Norway crowd [ 7 ]. Panoulas et al. [ 8 ] study showed that patients with rheumatoid arthritis, carrying rs1800541–rs5370 T–T haplotype were more likely to get blood pressure, showing that systolic and pulse pressure increased (Table  2 ).  

EDNRA mediates va so constriction and cell proliferation, and EDNRB mediates clearance of ET-1, endo the li al cell survival, and release of nitric oxide and prost a cyclin.

The effects of EDNRA and EDNRB on va so dilation are the opposite [ 9 ]. Study on EDNRA gene polymorphism found that rs5333 (His323His) was sign i cant ly correlated with mean thickness of men carotid intima-media [ 10 ], and rs5335 related with pulmonary function [ 11 ] and hypertension [ 12 ]. EDNRB gene rs5351 polymorphism and pulse wave velocity (brachial-ankle PWV, BAPWV) between male upper arm and ankle were sign i cant ly correlated [ 10 ]. This study analyzed the differences in the frequency distribution of EDN-1 (rs1800541, rs2070699, and rs5370), EDNRA (rs1801708, rs5333, and rs5335), and EDNRB (rs3818416 and rs5351) genotypes and alleles in ischemic stroke patient group—the control group and subgroups— control group, and gender subgroup, from the perspective of signaling pathways and investigated correlation of endothelin system gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke in Chinese Han population (Table  3 ).  

# Materials and Methods  

Study Participants  

A total of 747 participants (381 stroke cases and 366 controls) were recruited from Department of Neurology of the First Afﬁliated Hospital of Liaoning Medical University. Cases were recruited from those for treatment from January 2011 to December 2011. All patients had to have medical records with diagnosis from brain MRI and/or head CT. Control subjects were selected according to the case–control study criteria during the same period (control subjects matched to cases by sex and age). Controls had diseases except heart and cerebro vascular diseases, other neurological diseases, blood diseases, cancer, peripheral

vascular disease, and other diseases by history, physical examination, and clinical examination. All subjects agreed by the hospital ethics committee and signed informed consent.  

# Selection of SNPs and Genotyping  

DNA was extracted from the whole blood with Qiagen genomic DNA from whole blood extraction kit. The selected SNPs were genotyped by SnaP shot genotyping technologies. Eight pairs of PCR primers and multiple SNP single base extension primers were designed using Primer3 online. Obtained by multiplex PCR using HotStarTaq of Qiagen, PCR products were puriﬁed shrimp alkaline enzyme (SAP) (from Promega) and exon ucl ease I (EXO I) (from Epicentre), and then extension reaction was carried out using ABI’s SnaP shot Multiplex kit. Extension products were loaded in ABI3130xl after pur i cation. SNP genotyping were analyzed using Gene Mapper 4.0.  

Statistical Analysis  

Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested to judge the represent ation of the sample. Continuous variables were expressed as mean  $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$   and differences between case and control groups were analyzed by Student’s    $t$   test. Categorical variables were presented as percentage. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (Ors) and their 95 percent conﬁdence intervals   $95~\%$   CIs) using an additive genetic model. An additive model was built which assumed that the risk for carriers of the heterozygous genotype for developing the outcome was half way between carriers of the homozygous genotypes.  

# Results  

Comparison of General Characteristics Between Case Group and Control Group  

There was no signiﬁcant difference   $(P>0.05)$   in age, gender, and body mass index between case group and control group, and there was a signiﬁcant difference  $(P<0.05)$   in history of hypertension, smoking, and drinking history between two groups.  

SNP Genotype Distribution  

The results of the selected eight SNPs of three genes after SNaP shot genotyping are shown in Table  4 . After Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium test we found that the frequency distribution of rs5351 in the control group was at a critical value  $P=0.061$  ; therefore, it was considered that this SNP was inherited imbalanced in the control group, so there was no further analysis for the loci. The remaining sites in the control group were in compliance with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, indicating that the selected sample of the population had a good representation.

Correlation Between Genotype and Disease  

We analyzed the relationship of SNP polymorphisms and disease using logistic regression, and found that the relationship was quite different between different gender groups, so stratiﬁed analysis was based on gender. The results are shown in Tables  5  and  6 . In male population, G allele carrier of EDN1 gene rs2070699 compared with TT

genotype, the incidence of risk increased to 1.78 times  $P=0.009$  ; OR 1.78;  $95~\%$   CI 1.15–2.75); compared with GG genotype, the risk of disease of  $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}5370\,\mathrm{T}$   allele carriers increased to 1.49 times   $(P=0.048$  ; OR 1.49;   $95~\%$   CI 1.00–2.21). The morbidity risk of individuals with CC genotype of EDNRA gene rs5335 was sign i cant ly lower than T carriers   $P=0.016$  ; OR 0.52;   $95~\%$   CI 0.31–0.88). There was no signiﬁcant correlation between disease and the rest SNP polymorphisms in male population. In the female population, on EDNRA gene rs1801708, the risk of  

onset of AA genotype was sign i cant ly higher than G allele carriers (  $P=0.019$  ; OR 2.65;   $95~\%$   CI 1.18–6.00), and there was no other statistically signiﬁcant correlation (Table  6 ).  

# Discussion  

Endothelin-1 (EDN1) is the most potent va so constrictors known, which through endothelin receptor A (EDNRA) and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) mediated two-way effect of contraction after relaxation in endothelium-intact vessels. The present study suggests that EDN1 is an important risk factor of hypertension. Schiffrin et al. [ 13 ] for the ﬁrst time reveal the presence of EDN1 overexpression in vascular wall of patients with hypertension, and speculated that this phenomenon may play an important role in the process of elevated blood pressure and vascular proliferation. Later studies found that there was a relation between endothelin-1 Lys198 Asn polymorphism and pathogen es is of hypertension in obese individuals [ 14 ,  15 ]. Asai, who conducted the Japanese population study, conﬁrms this conclusion [ 16 ]. Recently, a study about the correlation between EDN1 and EDNRA and pulmonary hypertension in white population showed that, in the univariate analysis, during cardiac catheter insertion, the patients of EDNRA His323His TT genotype had lower cardiac index and their pulmonary vascular resistance index was higher. The results showed that EDNRA gene polymorphism may be associated with susceptibility to pulmonary hypertension [ 17 ].  

Ischemic stroke is a complex polygenic disease, coproduced by genetic factors and environment. Currently researchers believe that there are a variety of risk factors for ischemic stroke, and high blood pressure is one of the main risk factor. Studies have shown that the genetic predisposition of high blood pressure [ 18 ] may explain much of the genetic susceptibility of ischemic stroke. In 2005, Gormley et al. [ 19 ], who selected EDN1 (K198N), EDNRA  $(-231\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  ,    $+1222\mathrm{~C>T)}$  , and EDNRB (G57S, L277L) genes, conducted genotyping and haplotype analysis of 300 cases with small vessels and 600 controls. The results did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant difference of SNP polymorphisms or haplotypes between the case group and control group. They believed that the endothelin system’s gene polymorphisms were not a risk factor of small vessel disease. In 2009, MacClellan et al. studied 297 female cases between 15 and 49 years with ischemic stroke and 422 healthy Caucasian women for EDN1, EDNRB, and NOS3 gene polymorphisms. They found [ 20 ] that the risk of suffering from stroke for EDN1 gene rs1800542A allele carriers was more than two times higher than individuals of homozygous GG.  

EDNRB gene rs4885493 and rs10507875 polymorphisms were sign i cant ly associated with stroke.  

This study selected eight SNPs of EDN1 gene and its receptor genes EDNRA and EDNRB, and carried out correlation analysis of polymorphism and ischemic stroke onset. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the case group and the control group, but there were sign i cant ly different results between men groups and women groups. The results showed that in the male population, compared with the TT genotype, the incidence risk of EDN1 gene rs2070699 G allele carriers increased to 1.78 times   $P=0.009$  ; OR 1.78;  $95~\%$   CI 1.15–2.75); compared to the GG genotype, disease risk of   $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}5370\ \mathrm{T}$   allele carriers increased to 1.49 times   $\textstyle P=0.048$  ; OR 1.49;  $95~\%$   CI 1.00–2.21). So that G allele of rs2070699 and  $\mathrm{T}$   allele of rs5370 may be the risk factors of ischemic stroke in Chinese Han male population. The morbidity risk of individuals with CC genotype of EDNRA gene rs5335 was sign i cant ly lower than   $\mathrm{T}$   allele carriers   $\textstyle P=0.016$  ; OR 0.52;   $95~\%$   CI 0.31–0.88). There was no other signiﬁcant correlation between polymorphism and disease in the male population (Table  5 ). In the female population, on EDNRA gene rs1801708 loci, the risk of onset of AA genotypes was sign i cant ly higher than G allele carriers (  $P=0.019$  ; OR 2.65;  $95\mathrm{~\textperthousand~}$  . It can be considered that the AA genotype of EDNRA gene rs1801708 is a risk factor of ischemic stroke for the Chinese Han female individuals. There was no other statistically signiﬁcant correlation between the remaining polymorphism and disease (Table  6 ).  

The currently considered interaction with a known risk of ischemic stroke-related pathways—such as NO signaling pathway, RAS systems, and, therefore, genetic variants of endothelin system—may be an important pathogenic risk factor of ischemic stroke. The endothelin system gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke due to large and small vascular for Chinese Han population were studied in this topic, and certain results were achieved. However, due to complex causes of ischemic stroke, its pathogen i city function mutation sites have not yet been ﬁnalized. We need to further study the relationship between endothelin system gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke, and provide new theoretical basis for disease control and prevention.
