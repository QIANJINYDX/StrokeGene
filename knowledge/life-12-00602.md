Abstract:  The purpose of this pilot study was to explore whether polymorphisms in genes encoding the catalytic ( GCLC ) and modiﬁer ( GCLM ) subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme in glut at hi one synthesis, play a role in the development of ischemic stroke (IS) and the extent of brain damage. A total of 1288 unrelated Russians, including 600 IS patients and 688 ageand sex-matched healthy subjects, were enrolled for the study. Nine common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes were genotyped using the MassArray-4 system. SNP rs2301022 of  GCLM  was strongly associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke regardless of sex and age   $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.39$  , 95%CI 0.24–0.62,  $p<0.0001\$  ). Two common haplotypes of  GCLM  possessed protective effects against ischemic stroke risk   $(p<0.01)$  ), but exclusively in nonsmoker patients. Infarct size was increased by polymorphisms rs636933 and rs761142 of  GCLC . The  mbmdr  method enabled identifying epistatic interactions of  GCLC  and  GCLM  gene polymorphisms with known IS susceptibility genes that, along with environmental risk factors, jointly contribute to the disease risk and brain infarct size. Understanding the impact of genes and environmental factors on glut at hi one metabolism will allow the development of effective strategies for the treatment of ischemic stroke and disease prevention.

# 1. Introduction  

The stroke is the world’s fourth leading cause of long-term disability and death [ 1 , 2 ]. Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most common type of stroke attributed to either a thrombotic or embolic event, causing a decrease in blood ﬂow to the brain. Despite signiﬁcant advances in acute stroke management over recent decades, stroke-related morbidity and mortality continue to be major public health concerns [ 3 ]. In this regard, there is a great deal of interest in identifying new potential targets that may improve the quality of ischemic stroke treatment and prevention.  

Ischemic stroke is a multi factorial disease determined by complex interactions between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors such as cigarette smoking, air pollution, sedentary lifestyle, and other factors [ 4 , 5 ]. Recent advances in omics techniques have considerably improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke, discovered numerous genetic polymorphisms associated with disease susceptibility, and identiﬁed novel therapeutic targets [ 4 , 6 ]. Despite notable success in this ﬁeld of research, the genetic contribution to some molecular mechanisms of cerebro vascular disease remains poorly investigated. A disruption in redox homeostasis, a cellular reductionoxidation status, and resulted oxidative stress are recognized as major common conditions underlying the pathogen es is of car dio metabolic, cardiovascular, and cerebro vascular disorders [ 7 – 9 ]. A growing body of evidence indicates that oxidative stress, attributed to excessive production of reactive oxygen species and/or poor antioxidant defense, contributes to the multistep path o genetic mechanisms of cerebro vascular disease, starting with a the rogen ic changes in the carotid arteries such as endo the li al dysfunction, macrophage recruitment and adhesion, following at hero sclerotic plaque progression and rupture through intra plaque hemorrhage, neo vascular iz ation, and ﬁbrous cap thickness—events ultimately leading to artery occlusion and ischemic damage to the brain [ 9 , 10 ].  

Glut at hi one (GSH), a tripeptide consisting of cysteine, glycine, and glutamate, is the main antioxidant and most prevalent thiol-containing peptide regulating the cellular redox homeostasis. GSH exerts numerous physiological functions such as cellular proliferation, mitochondrial maintenance, autophagy, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, conjugation of xe no biotic s, epigenetic regulation, DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and glut at hi on yl ation of proteins [ 11 , 12 ]. It is important to note that glut at hi one plays a key role in the protection of cells against oxidative damage attributed to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS-associated depletion of GSH contributes to endo the li al dysfunction and at hero sclerotic plaque rupture, followed by arterial thrombosis [ 13 , 14 ], thereby leading to organ/tissue ischemia and necrosis. Thus, a plethora of physiological functions makes glut at hi one a critical regulator of a variety of metabolic processes in the cardiovascular and nervous systems, and the dys regulation in GSH biosynthesis may have an e tio logical role in atherosclerosis, including in carotid arteries. Despite the clear importance of glut at hi one in vas cula ture and brain metabolism [ 15 , 16 ], existing data on the roles of genes encoding enzymes involved in glut at hi one metabolism are surprisingly limited. A few studies have so far investigated the relationship between genes encoding glut at hi one-metabolizing enzymes and the risk of ischemic stroke and its outcomes. These genetic association studies have been focused on enzymes such as glut at hi one S-transfer as es [ 17 – 21 ] and glut at hi one per oxidase s [ 22 , 23 ] that use glut at hi one as a substrate for the detox i cation of foreign compounds and hydrogen peroxide, respectively [ 19 – 21 , 23 ]. No studies have so far been undertaken to investigate the contribution of polymorphic genes involved in glut at hi one biosynthesis to the development and severity of ischemic stroke, although a deﬁciency of glut at hi one in IS patients has been reported by several studies [ 24 – 26 ]. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether genetic variation in glutamate-cysteine ligase, an enzyme that catalyzes the ﬁrst and rate-limiting step in the production of glut at hi one, contributes to the risk of ischemic stroke and brain infarct size.  

# 2. Materials and Methods  

# 2.1. Study Participants and Clinical Examination  

Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrollment in this study. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Kursk State Medical University. A total of 1288 unrelated Russians, including 600 patients with a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and 688 healthy subjects, were enrolled from Kursk hospitals over two periods, such as between 2007 and 2013 [ 19 , 23 ] and between 2015 and 2017, as described previously [ 27 ]. Subjects for the control group were enrolled for the same time periods and included healthy blood volunteers and also hospital-based patients with no history or clinical signs of cerebro vascular, cardiovascular, endocrine, or other chronic diseases. Cerebral infarction was veriﬁed by qualiﬁed neurologists based on clinical examination, CT, and/or MRI of the brain. The cerebral infarct volume was measured by MRI and expressed in mm (the maximum diameter of the brain damage). We did not include stroke patients in the study with a positive history of cardiac arrhythmia s. Baseline, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the study participants are described in Table  1 . The control group was matched to the patient group for sex, age, and body mass index   $(p>0.05)$  . Study participants completed a validated interviewer-administered questionnaire assessing cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, life stress, dietary intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, and other environmental risk factors, as described previously [ 28 , 29 ]. Information on smoking habits was obtained from all patients with ischemic stroke and 637 healthy subjects. Data on alcohol consumption were available from all IS patients and 251 healthy controls. Information on the intake of fresh fruits and vegetables was obtained from 598 IS patients and 255 healthy controls. As can be seen from Table  1 , the number of smokers (ever/never) and alcohol abusers was higher among patients with ischemic stroke than among healthy individuals. No difference in patients’ intake of fresh fruits and vegetables was found between the case and control groups. As can be seen from Table  1 , plasma ROS concentrations were sign i cant ly higher in patients with ischemic stroke than in healthy subjects   $(p=0.004)$  , whereas the levels of plasma GSSG were sign i cant ly lower in IS patients than in controls   $(p=0.008)$  .

# 2.2. SNP Selection  

For the study, nine common tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within both catalytic (rs12524494, rs17883901, rs606548, rs636933, rs648595,  and rs761142 of  GCLC )  and modifier (rs2301022, rs3827715, and rs7517826 of  GCLM ) subunits constituting glutamate-cysteine ligase were selected according to the functional properties of the polymorphisms and linkage d is equilibrium between them (HapMap data, European population). We aimed at the best coverage of common functional SNPs per a gene: tagSNPs in each haplotype block were selected according to the criteria of  $\mathbf{r}^{2}\ge\mathbf{\bar{0}}.8$   and MAF  (minor allele frequency)  $>5\%$  .  

SNP selection was performed using the Candidate Gene SNP Selection (GenePipe) tool available online at SNPinfo Web Server ( https://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/selegene. html  (accessed on 12 March 2021)).  

# 2.3. Genetic Analysis  

Approximately  $5\:\mathrm{mL}$   of venous blood was collected from the cubital vein of each participant into EDTA-coated tubes and maintained at    $-20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until processed. Genomic DNA was extracted from thawed blood samples by the standard procedure of phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. To investigate whether SNPs in glutamate-cysteine ligase genes interact with known susceptibility genes for ischemic stroke, we selected eight SNPs that have previously shown strong associations with disease risk in several genomewide association studies in European populations, as described previously [ 27 ]. The SNPs associated with ischemic stroke risk included rs2417957 of  SLCO1B1 , rs6511720 of  LDLR , rs4322086 of  RASEF , rs12449964 of  PEMT , rs12646447 of  PITX2 , rs899997 (LOC105370913), rs11556924 of  ZC3HC1 , and rs783396 of  AIM1 . The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry iPLEX platform (Agena Bioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for genotyping the SNPs. Primer sequences used for genotyping are available upon request. To ensure quality control,  $5\%$   of DNA samples were genotyped in duplicates blinded to the case-control status. The concordance rate was  ${\tt>}99\%$  . DNA analysis was carried out at the Research Institute for Genetic and Molecular Epidemiology of Kursk State Medical University (Kursk, Russia).  

# 2.4. Biochemical Investigations  

Fasting venous blood samples were collected from 139 patients with ischemic stroke and 58 healthy subjects in lithium heparin sterile tubes and immediately centrifuged at  $1200\times g$   using assay kits according to the manufacturer’s instru Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, USA). Plasma samples were aliquoted and stored at  −  $-80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$    C until further use. Two alternative biochemical parameters reﬂecting redox homeostasis such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized glut at hi one (GSSG) levels were measured by Varioscan Flash microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) in all plasma samples of IS patients and healthy subjects (GSSG levels were assessed in 91 patients with IS and 44 controls), as described previously [ 30 ].  

# 2.5. Statistical and Bioinformatics Analysis  

Allele and genotype frequencies in the case and control groups were counted and compared by the Fisher exact test to identify signiﬁcant departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies in the study groups and their associations with disease risk and brain infarct size were analyzed using the SNPStats software ( https://www.snpstats.net/start.htm  (accessed on 14 April 2021)) [ 31 ]. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations of  GCLC  and  GCLM genotypes with the risk of ischemic events. Continuous variables were analyzed for normal distribution by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Since brain infarct size was not normally distributed, it was presented as a median with an interquartile range (Q1–Q3). Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between SNPs and brain infarct size, which was previously transformed to a normal variable through the procedure of inverse transformation of ranks. All associations were adjusted for age and gender. Replication for associations between SNPs and ischemic stroke was performed using genotype datasets available from the Cardiovascular Cerebro vascular Disease Knowledge Portal ( https://cd. hugeamp.org  (accessed on 25 March 2022)) and the Gene ATLAS database of UK Biobank

 ( http://geneatlas.roslin.ed.ac.uk  (accessed on 26 March 2022)). Linkage d is equilibrium

 (LD) measures such as Lewontin’s  $D$   and    $D^{\prime}$    [ 32 ] were calculated with the LDpair Tool

 ( https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov  (accessed on 16 April 2021)) using genotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project and GRCh37 human genome assembly.  

The multi factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method was used to investigate gene–gene and gene–environment   $\mathrm{(GxE)}$   interactions underlying susceptibility to ischemic stroke and inﬂuencing brain infarct size [ 33 ]. MDR is a popular data-mining and modelfree bioinformatics approach developed to identify high-order interactions between genes and environmental factors contributing to complex traits and multi factorial diseases. The model-based multi factor dimensionality reduction method ( mbmdr ), an extension of the MDR method implemented in a mbmdr package for R [ 34 – 36 ], was used to identify a set of statistically signiﬁcant  $\mathbf{GxG}$   and  $\mathrm{GxE}$   interactions instead of a single best model provided by the traditional MDR analysis. The mbmdr analysis algorithm we used has been described in detail previously [ 28 ]. Two-, three-, four- and ﬁve order  $\mathbf{GxG}$   and  $\mathrm{GxE}$   interaction models were evaluated, and their statistical sign i can ce  $p$  -values   $\mathrm{(P_{perm})}$   were assessed for each  $n$  -order model through a permutation procedure (1000 permutation tests). Then we counted the number of n-models in which each attribute was involved, and the resultant value was considered as a measure of the contribution of an attribute (a variable such as SNP or risk factor) to the polygenic background, as estimated by the mbmdr method. This methodology was described in detail recently [ 37 ]. Post hoc logistic regression was used to assess the associations of pairwise genotype combinations between the lead SNPs involved in the best 2-order mbmdr models of  $\mathbf{GxG}$   interactions with the risk of ischemic stroke, and the resulting  $p$  -values were corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR).  

Since the investigated SNPs are located in noncoding sequences, we carried out a comprehensive functional annotation of them using various bioinformatics methods. In particular, the SNP Function Prediction tool (FuncPred,  https://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov  (accessed on 2 April 2021)) [ 38 ] and the Regulome database ( https://regulomedb.org  (accessed on 3 April 2021 )) annotating SNPs with known and predicted regulatory elements in the intergenic regions of the Homo sapiens genome [ 39 ] were used to assess the regulatory potential of the polymorphisms. The following bioinformatics recourses were used for assessing the impact of the SNPs on expression levels of  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes in blood, arteries, and brain tissues: the GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) project is a comprehensive public resource for studying tissue-speciﬁc gene expression and regulation ( https://gtexportal.org (accessed on 4 April 2021)) [ 40 ]; eQTLGen is a database on the downstream consequences of trait-related genetic variants ( https://www.eqtlgen.org  ( accessed on 6 April 2021 )) [ 41 ]. QTLbase curates and compiles genome-wide QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) summary statistics for many human molecular traits across over  70 tissue/cell  types ( http://www. mulinlab.org/qtlbase  (accessed on 6 April 2021)) [ 42 ]. The epigenetic regulation of SNPs through histone marks, open chromatin DNAse, and CTCF binding sites was assessed by the SNPnexus tools utilizing both ENCODE and Roadmap Epi genomics databases ( https://www.snp-nexus.org  (accessed on 7 April 2021)) [ 43 ]. DNA methyl ation related to the SNPs was assessed through the mQTL analysis provided by QTLbase [ 42 ]. Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were in silico predicted by Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor [ 44 ], Transfac database [ 45 ] tools provided by the SNPnexus database, and the atSNP search [ 46 ] bioinformatics tools ( http://atsnp.biostat.wisc.edu  (accessed on 9 July 2021)).  

# 3. Results  

3.1. The Impact of the Studied Polymorphisms on the Risk of Ischemic Stroke and Brain Infarct Size  

The genotype and allele frequencies of glutamate-cysteine ligase gene polymorphisms in the study groups are presented in Table  2 . Two SNPs, such as rs12524494 of  GCLC  and rs2301022 of  GCLM , showed a deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in both study groups   $(p<0.01)$  , whereas SNP rs648595 of  GCLC  showed a deviation from HWE only in the IS patients   $(p<0.001)$  , as assessed by Fisher’s exact test. No departure from HWE was found for other polymorphisms in either the case or control groups   $(p>0.05)$  .  

The allele frequencies in the study patients were comparable with those reported in other European populations, according to the data published in the 1000 Genomes Project, Phase 3 ( http://www.ensembl.org  (accessed on 3 April 2021)). As shown in Table  2 , SNP rs2301022 of  GCLM  was found to be strongly associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke even after adjustment for sex and age   $(p<0.0001)$  . In particular, genotype rs2301022-T/T showed an association with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke (  $\mathrm{{corOR}}=0.36,$   $95\%\mathrm{CI}\;0.23–0.57,$   $p<0.0001$  , recessive effect of SNP). In contrast, a heterozygous genotype rs2301022-C/T of  GCLM  was associated with an increased disease risk   $\mathrm{(corOR}=1.35,$  ,  $95\%C I\;1.07{-}1.69,\,p=0.01,$  , over dominant effect of SNP). Moreover, an SNP rs648595 of the GCLC  gene showed an association with ischemic stroke risk but at a borderline statistical level   $(p=0.049)$   in a codominant genotypic model. Genotype rs648595-G/T of  GCLC was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke after adjustment for sex and age  $(\mathrm{cor}^{}\mathrm{OR}=1.28)$  ,   $95\%C I$   1.03–1.60,  $p=0.029$  , over dominant effect of SNP). No statistically signiﬁcant associations of other polymorphisms with disease risk were observed   $(p>0.05)$  .

Table  3  shows the results of the association analysis between  GCLC  and  GCLM  haplotypes and the risk of ischemic stroke. Nine and six common haplotypes with a frequency greater than  $1\%$   were identiﬁed in the  GCLC  and GCLM genes, respectively.

1  Rare (frequency  $\leq0.01$  ) haplotypes with a summarized frequency;  2  Odds ratio with  $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals adjusted for sex and age. Statistically signiﬁcant associations are bolded; haplotypes sign i cant ly associated with IS risk are highlighted by gray.  

No signiﬁcant differences in the haplotype distribution for the genes were found between the groups (global haplotype association  $p>0.05,$  ). However, haplotype    $H8$   of GCLC  (A-G-G-C-C-G) was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (  $\mathrm{{corOR}}=3.37,$  ,  $95\%C I$   1.18–9.62,    $p=0.024)$  . In addition, haplotype    $H3$   of  GCLM  (C-T-T) possessed a protective effect against the risk of ischemic stroke   $\mathrm{{(cor)}R=0.76,}$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}\,0.61{-}0.95,$   $p=0.016\$  . The haplotype association analysis stratiﬁed by risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, life stress, and dietary intake of fresh fruits and vegetables showed that smoking status is a risk factor modifying the relationship between  GCLM haplotypes and ischemic stroke susceptibility (Table  4 ). It is found that nonsmoker carriers of two common haplotypes such as A-C-C and C-T-T (each haplotype frequency greater than  $20\%$  ) of the  GCLM  gene possess a sign i cant ly decreased risk of ischemic stroke  $(p<0.005)$  . Meanwhile, the protective effects of these haplotypes against disease risk were not seen in tobacco smokers. Other environmental risk factors and genetic variants studied did not have any statistically signiﬁcant synergistic effects on the risk of ischemic stroke.

The majority of investigated SNPs were in linkage d is equilibrium with each other to various degrees, and there were differences in the    $D$  -values between the Russian population and other populations. Tables  5  and  6  show the linkage d is equilibrium values between SNPs in the  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes, respectively. As can be seen from  Table  5 ,  $D$  -values between polymorphisms rs636933 and rs12524494 were negative in the studied Russian population and positive in both the European and mixed populations of the 1000 Genomes Project. The principal inter population differences in the    $D$  -values were observed in SNP pairs of the  GCLC  gene such as rs12524494-rs648595, rs636933- rs761142, rs636933-rs606548, rs648595-rs761142, rs648595-rs606548, rs761142-rs17883901, and rs606548-rs17883901 ( Table  5 ). Inter population differences regarding D-values were also found between SNPs of the  GCLM  gene. In particular, SNP rs2301022 was in a negative  

# LD with polymorphisms rs7517826 and rs3827715 in the Russian population, whereas LD-values between these SNPs were positive in the European populations (Table  6 ).

Through a multiple linear regression with adjustment for sex and age, we analyzed the impact of glutamate-cysteine ligase genotypes and haplotypes on the normalized brain infarct size. As can be seen from Figure  1 , the carriage of genotypes rs636933 G/A-A/A of GCLC , in comparison with the  $\mathrm{G/G}$   genotype, was associated with a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the size of brain infarction by   $196.36\,\mathrm{mm}$   (  $\acute{p}=0.0089$  , dominant effect of SNP). The rs761142 A/C-C/C genotypes of the  GCLC  gene were also characterized by a signiﬁcant effect on brain infarct volume compared to the A/A genotype   $(p=0.015)$  , dominant effect of SNP). Figure  2  summarizes the impact of  GCLC  and  GCLM  genotypes (A) and haplotypes (B) on infarct size in the brains of patients with ischemic stroke. Common haplotype  $H2$   of  GCLC  (A-A-G-C-C-G) was found to be associated with an increased size of brain infarction   $(p=0.02)$  . Haplotype  $H6$   of  GCLM  (A-T-T) showed a strong impact on the size of the damaged brain in patients with ischemic stroke: carriage of this haplotype increased the volume of brain damage by  $27\,\mathrm{mm}$   more than carriage of the common 10 of 36    haplotype   $(p=0.0005)$  . Other haplotypes of the  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes had no effect on brain infarct size.

3.2. Replication Analysis for SNP-Disease Associations in Independent Populations -models (include the  

A replication study for SNP-ischemic stroke associations in independent population cohorts was carried out using large-scale genotype datasets available at the Cerebro vascular Knowledge with the number of  mbmdr -models per SNP/risk factor associated with the risk of isPortal and the UK biobank. The following stroke phenotypes of the Cerebro vascular Knowlchemic stroke. In total, 75 two-order, 492 three-order, 1999 four-order, and 8541  edge Portal were analyzed for the replication analysis: “large artery atherosclerosis” (TOAST five-order SNP-SNP and SNP-risk factor interactions models were found to be significlassification) and “all ischemic stroke”. Moreover, stroke-related phenotypes such as “transient cerebral ischaemic attacks and related syndromes” and “stroke, not specified as haemorrhage or infarction” were used for the replication analysis in the UK Biobank cohort. Table mbmdr  shows associations between the analysis. For comparison, SNPs that are known to be strongly (  polymorphisms and the analyzed ischemic stroke with ischemic stroke (i.e., GWAS loci) were presented in 35% of two-order models, 37%   and the risk of ischemic stroke (large artery atherosclerosis) was replicated (  = 0.03) in the Spanish cohort (the VHIR FMT dataset: 515 cases and 316 controls). However, the polymorphism was negatively associated with stroke risk in the Russian population and positively in Hispanics. As we found in the present SNPs (34% of two-order, 34% of three-order, 42% of four-order, and 38% of five-order  study, the carriers of allele rs761142-C of the  GCLC  gene had a larger infarct size than those with models) among the best models with the lowest permutation  p -values. These data show  the alternative allele. Interestingly, the allele rs761142-C was found to be associated with an that the GWAS loci are more strongly linked to the risk of ischemic stroke than the  GCLC   increased risk of large artery atherosclerosis   $(p=0.04)$   in the mixed population cohort (MEGASand  GCLM  gene polymorphisms.   TROKE GWAS dataset). Interestingly, polymorphisms of  GCLC  and    $G C L M$   genes that did not show associations with ischemic stroke risk in our population were found to be associated with disease risk in other populations. In particular, SNPs such as rs12524494   $(p=0.006)$   and rs606548  $(p=0.036)$   of the  GCLC  gene were associated with the risk of large artery atherosclerosis in the MEGASTROKE GWAS dataset, including European populations with sample sizes of 190,513 and 189,632 subjects, respectively. In addition, polymorphism rs17883901 of  GCLC  showed a significant association with ischemic stroke   $(p=0.023)$   in the Spanish population (VHIR FMT 2018). In the Spanish population, polymorphisms rs3827715   $(p=0.02)$   and rs7517826   $(p=0.026)$  of the  GCLM  gene were found to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke.

3.3. Gene–Gene and Gene–Environment Interactions, Ischemic Stroke Risk, and Brain In farc t Size  

Since ischemic stroke is a multi factorial disorder, it is important to unravel the nature of complex gene–gene and gene–environment interactions that determine a polygenic susceptibility to disease. Following this aim, the model-based multi factor dimensionality reduction method ( mbmdr ) was applied to the dataset to identify a set of high-order  $\mathrm{GxcG}$  and  $\mathrm{GxE}$   interactions underlying disease susceptibility and inﬂuencing the severity of brain damage. The mbmdr analysis was performed on a dataset including, besides  GCLC  and GCLM  SNPs, information on smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and fruit and vegetable intake (environmental risk factors of stroke), as well as genotypes of eight SNPs associated with disease risk as a result of genome-wide association studies in European populations (GWAS loci), as we described previously [ 27 ].  

Summary statistics for all  mbmdr -models and the best  mbmdr -models (include the   $25\%$  of models with the lowest permutation  $p$  -values) associated with IS susceptibility are shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Figure  3 A represents diagrams with the number of  mbmdr -models per SNP/risk factor associated with the risk of ischemic stroke. In total, 75 two-order, 492 three-order, 1999 four-order, and 8541 ﬁve-order SNP-SNP and SNPrisk factor interactions models were found to be sign i cant ly   $(P_{\mathrm{perm}}<0.05)$   associated with the risk of ischemic stroke. Notably, polymorphisms of  GCLC  and  GCLM  were presented in  $38\%$   of two-order models,   $43\%$   of three-order models,  $44\%$   of four-order models, and  $45\%$   of ﬁve-order models obtained by the  mbmdr  analysis. For comparison, SNPs that are known to be s gly   $(p<5\times10^{-8})$   ass ed with ischemic strok ., GWAS loci) were presented in 35% of two-order models, 37% of three-order models, 39% of four-order models, and   $40\%$   of ﬁve-order  mbmdr -models. In contrast, a percentage of these models (  $42\%$   of two-order,  $40\%$   of three-order,   $41\%$   of four-order, and  $50\%$   of ﬁve-order models) exceeded that for glutamate cysteine ligase SNPs (  $34\%$   of two-order,   $34\%$   of three-order,  $42\%$   of four-order, and  $38\%$   of ﬁve-order models) among the best models with the lowest permutation  $p$  -values. These data show that the GWAS loci are more strongly linked to the risk of ischemic stroke than the  GCLC  and  GCLM  gene polymorphisms.  

Table  8  shows the best    $n$  -order gene–gene and gene–environment interactions significantly associated with the risk of ischemic stroke (only the top four models per order are shown). Notably, a significant number of the best  mbmdr -models comprised polymorphisms of  GCLC and  GCLM  genes. This was especially noticeable among the five-order  mbmdr -models shown in Table  8 . In addition,  $\mathrm{GxE}$   interactions, including risk factors such as smoking, alcohol abuse, and low vegetable and fruit intake, may point out a trigger role of the environmental factors in the development of ischemic stroke in individuals with unfavorable genotype combinations of the studied SNPs. Interestingly, a large portion of the  mbmdr -models associated with disease risk represent interactions between GWAS loci and glutamate-cysteine ligase SNPs, suggesting the involvement of both groups of genes in the polygenic mechanisms of ischemic stroke. Another important finding was that the percentage of models comprising  GCLC/GCLM  genetic variants, and GWAS loci increased progressively as model complexity increased (from two-order to fiveorder interaction models), while the percentage of mbmdr-models containing environmental risk factors decreased dramatically.  

A post hoc analysis of associations between pairwise genotype combinations (diplotypes) and the risk of ischemic stroke was performed for polymorphisms comprising the majority of the two-order  mbmdr -models. These SNPs include:  GCLM  rs2301022,  RASEF rs4322086, and  PEMT  rs12449964. Table  9  summarizes the identiﬁed statistically signiﬁcant associations of diplotypes with a predisposition to ischemic stroke. After adjusting for multiple testing by the FDR procedure, we identiﬁed diplotypes associated with both increased and decreased disease risk.  ${\cal R}A S E F~\mathrm{rs}4322086{\mathrm{-}}{\mathrm{G/G}}\times{\cal G}C L M\,\mathrm{rs}2301022{\mathrm{-}}C/\mathrm{T}$   $(\mathrm{FDR}=0.04)$  ),  ${R A S E F\,\mathrm{rs}4322086{\mathrm{-G/A}}\times G C L M\,\mathrm{rs}2301022{\mathrm{-C/O}}}$   × 22-C/C (FDR = 0.015), and  RASEF

Notably, a significant number of the  Summary statistics for all mbmdr-models and the best  mbmdr -models associated with brain infarct size are shown in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively. Figure  2 B represents diagrams with the number of mbmdr-models per SNP/risk factor associated with brain infarct alcohol abuse, and low vegetable and fruit intake, may point out a trigger  size. In total, 25 two-order, 109 three-order, 524 four-order, and 2143 five-order gene–gene and gene–environment interactions models were found to be significantly   $(P_{\mathrm{perm}}<0.05)$   associated Interestingly, a large portion of the  mbmdr -models associated with disease  with brain infarct size. Thus, the number of models significantly associated with the volume of brain damage is significantly less than the models associated with the risk of ischemic stroke.   Apparently, the studied genes play a greater role in the predisposition to ischemic stroke than in determining the volume of brain infarct in stroke patients. Among all the mbmdr-models, polymorphisms of  GCLC  and  GCLM  were presented in   $21\%$   of two-order models,   $37\%$   of three-order models,   $46\%$   of four-order models, and   $47\%$   of five-order models obtained by the mbmdr analysis. This means that the percentage of models representing  GCLC  and  GCLM  SNPs increased progressively with the increasing complexity of the models, while the percentage of models comprising GWAS loci decreased progressively (  $64\%$   for two-order models,   $48\%$   for three-order models,  $44\%$   for four-order models, and  $40\%$   for five-order models). Table  10  shows the best  $n$  -order gene–gene and gene–environment interactions significantly associated with brain infarct size (only the top four models per order are shown). Polymorphisms of  GCLC and  GCLM  genes represented a significant number of five-order models. The great majority of the best  $n$  -order models comprised interactions between the GWAS loci and glutamate-cysteine ligase SNPs. As a whole, the contributions of the GWAS loci and  GCLC/GCLM  SNPs to ischemic damage in the brain were comparable.

3.4. Functional Annotation of GCLC and GCLM Polymorphisms  

Since the investigated polymorphisms of  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes are located in noncoding sequences (introns) of the genes, there is a difﬁculty in deciphering their biological functions in the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke. In recent years, the increasing multiomics databases and resources, providing integrated access to large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and other omics datasets, have made it possible to clarify the function of noncoding variants in the human genome [ 47 , 48 ]. Here, we conducted a comprehensive functional annotation for SNPs of genes encoding catalytic and modiﬁer subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase. Table  11  summarizes the results of functional annotations of GCLM  and  GCLC  gene polymorphisms using various bioinformatics tools and resources. The regulatory potential of SNPs was analyzed in silico using two bioinformatics tools, such as FuncPred and the Regulome database.  

It was predicted that SNP rs17883901 of  GCLC  had a regulatory potential value of 0.249 and a score of 3a (TF binding  $^+$   any motif   $^+$   DNase peak) according to FuncPred assessment and functional annotation of the Regulome database, respectively. An SNP rs648595 of  GCLC  possessed a regulatory potential value of 0.187 and a regulome score of 5 (presence of TF binding or DNase hypersensitivity sites). The polymorphism rs2301022 of the  GCLM  gene associated with ischemic stroke had a Regulome score of 4, suggesting the presence of both TF binding and DNase hypersensitivity sites at this locus.  

The GTEx portal, eQTLGen  Consortium , and QTLbase were used to identify SNPassociated eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci, genomic loci explaining all or a fraction of the variation in expression levels of mRNAs) in arteries or aorta, brain tissues, and blood. The results of the eQTL analysis are summarized in Supplementary Table S5. All SNPs, except rs17883901 of  GCLC,  represent signiﬁcant  cis -eQTLs in the blood according to the eQTLGen  Consortium  and QTLbase resources. All SNPs, except rs12524494, rs17883901, and rs606548 of  GCLC , are involved in  cis -eQTLs in the brain tissues. According to the GTEx portal, two SNPs in the  GCLM  gene, rs7517826 and rs3827715, were associated with cis-eQTLs in arteries (data from the GTEx portal, v7,  https://gtexportal.org  (accessed on 1 April 2021)). In particular, SNP rs7517826 of  GCLM  represents two eQTLs in the tibial arteries   $(p=2.1\times10^{-6})$   and the aorta   $(p=8.6\times10^{-6})$  ). In addition, SNP rs3827715 was associated with a change in the  GCLM  gene expression in the tibial arteries   $(p=0.000002)$  and aorta   $(p=0.0001)$  ).  

Furthermore, we used QTLbase to look for QTLs associated with tissue/cell typespeciﬁc molecular functions such as DNA methyl ation (mQTL), histone modi cation (hQTL), splicing events (sQTL), and other molecular traits that have been incorporated into the current version of QTLbase ( http://mulinlab.tmu.edu.cn  (accessed on 3 April 2021)). The results of this analysis are summarized in Supplementary Table S6. Thirteen signiﬁcant methyl ation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) in brain tissues were found for polymorphisms rs2301022 (one mQTL), rs3827715 (six mQTLs), and rs7517826 (six mQTLs). No signiﬁcant mQTLs for the studied SNPs were observed in the arteries or aorta. Interestingly, two polymorphisms, such as rs636933   $(p=3.7\times10^{-19})$  ) and rs648595   $(p=3.0\times10^{-8})$  ), were associated with tissue-speciﬁc splicing events of the  GCLC  gene in the brain.

Detailed information on the usage of both bioinformatics tools is described in the Methods Section. TFBS, transcription factor binding site.  

The SNPnexus resource was used to search for histone modi cation and open chromatin DNase I hypersensitive sites in brain tissues, arteries, and blood from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epi genomics projects to predict which SNPs were enriched in what kinds of histone marks and DNase peaks (Supplementary Table S7). We found that several SNPs represent subjects to epigenetic modi cations, inﬂuencing gene activity in normal human astrocytes, aorta, blood, and other tissues. In particular, several polymorphisms have been found to be related to histone marks, such as rs2301022 of the  GCLM  gene (H4K20me1, H3K4me2, and H3K4me1), rs12524494 (H3K36me3), and rs761142 (H4K20me1) of the  GCLC gene in normal human astrocytes. The rs17883901 polymorphism was associated with histone marked regions H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, hypersensitivity of chromatin to DNase1, and poised promoter activity of the gene in normal human astrocytes. Moreover, the SNP of  GCLM  rs3827715 was related to histone mark H4K20me1 and repressed the promoter ﬂanking region in astrocytic glial cells in humans. The  GCLC  polymorphism rs17883901 was found to be epigenetic ally regulated via histone H3K4me1 modi cations and gene promoter activity in the aorta.  

Then we evaluated whether the studied SNPs might regulate enhancer activity by affecting the binding ability of various transcription factors (TF). Bioinformatics resources such as VEP, Transfac, and atSNP have revealed that the investigated polymorphisms are located within DNA motifs that are targets for the binding of multiple transcription factors or transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). In particular, Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor identiﬁed that SNP rs17883901 of  GCLC  is located within a DNA motif which is a target for binding of transcription factor complexes such as GCM1:CEBPB, TFAP4:MAX, and OXB2:RFX5, whereas SNP rs606548 creates binding sites for transcription factor complexes GCM1::FIGLA and ETV2:RFX5.  

We also found that the substitution from T to C of rs3827715 of  GCLM  would affect the binding afﬁnity of TFs RUNX3 and RUNX2. According to the TRANSFAC database, polymorphism rs17883901 was predicted to be a subject for a number of transcription factors such as AP1, AP4, AREB6, CEBPA, PPARA, PPARG, and SREBP1.  

Finally, the atSNP Search bioinformatics tool was used to identify and quantify best DNA sequence matches to the transcription factor position weight matrices with both the reference and the SNP alleles of the  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes, following evaluation of the statistical sign i can ce of the match scores with each allele and calculating the  $p$  -value of the score difference between the best matches with the reference and SNP alleles [ 46 ]. Detailed information on TFBS in the regions of SNPs predicted by the atSNP Search tool is shown in Supplementary Table S8. Numerous transcription factor binding sites regions have been predicted around SNPs with the potential to impact on the expression levels of genes. Molecular functions of transcription factors such as activators, repressors, or dual effects on transcription were assessed by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis hosted by the Enrichr online resource [ 49 ] and through manual annotation of the UNIPROT database. Attention should be paid to the polymorphisms of the  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes, which were found to inﬂuence the risk of ischemic stroke and brain infarct size. For instance, allele T at SNP rs2301022 of  GCLM  protecting against ischemic stroke was associated with creating the binding sites for numerous transcription factors such as PDX1, ZSCAN26, ELF3, ZNF652, PAX4, SMARCC1, JDP2, FOXP3, ZBTB33, PRRX2, MEF2A, OTX2, DMBX1,RHOXF2, JUND, PITX1, JUNB, CUX1, HNF4A, UNCX, PAX5, FOSL2, HOXB5, BARX1, TFAP2A, SRF, VSX2, FOS, and POU6F2. However, as predicted by the atSNP Search tool, an alternative allele rs2301022-C increasing disease risk was discovered to potentially disrupt the binding sires for the TFs listed above. This allele was found to create TFBS for SPIC, TP53, STAT2: STAT1, RUNX2, SPI1, IRF3, SPI1, PAX3, GABPA, IRF1, HDAC2, IRF5, MYB, IRF1, HDAC2, IRF8, HNF4A, TFCP2, SETDB1, and IRF5.  

# 4. Discussion  

A problem with the genetic regulation of glut at hi one metabolism still remains outside the mainstream of research on the molecular mechanisms of cerebro vascular diseases. This happens despite numerous obvious facts clearly demonstrating that glut at hi one is the most important biologically active molecule, critically required for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and antioxidant protection as well as for the normal functioning of metabolic processes in the brain. Surprisingly, a few studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between polymorphisms in genes encoding glut at hi one metabolism enzymes and the risk of ischemic stroke and its complications. In particular, in a Chinese population of 189 IS patients and 169 healthy patients, Man et al. [ 50 ] did not reveal statistically signiﬁcant differences between the groups in the frequency of alleles and genotypes of the − 129C/T promoter polymorphism (rs17883901) of ene. Another study in an Italian population of 100 patients showed that the  − 129C > T SNP of the  GCLC  gene is associated with cardiovascular events, including the development of cerebral stroke [ 51 ]. In a study by Ba  and colleagues [ 52 ], the    $-588C>\mathrm{T}$   polymorphic variant (rs41303970), also located in the 5’-ﬂanking region of the  GCLM  gene, showed an association with cognitive impairment that occurs against the background of ischemic stroke, although the association of this SNP with the risk of ischemic stroke has not been investigated. In addition, these GCLC  and  GCLM  gene polymorphisms showed statistically signiﬁcant associations with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and endo the li al dysfunction [ 53 , 54 ]. Much more often, the objects of genetic association studies in ischemic stroke were polymorphic variants of glut at hi one-S-transfer as e genes, which showed associations with disease risk [ 17 , 19 , 21 ]. Furthermore, in a previous study, we looked at the associations between polymorphisms in glut at hi one peroxidase genes such as GPX1 (rs1050450), GPX3 (rs2070593), and GPX4 (rs713041) and the risk of cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients, and we observed that SNP rs713041 of the GPX4 gene is associated with an increased risk of stroke [ 23 ].  

The present study was undertaken for the ﬁrst time to investigate the contribution of polymorphic genes encoding catalytic and modiﬁer subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase, a key and rate-limiting enzyme for biosynthesis of glut at hi one, to the development of ischemic stroke and brain infarct volume. It is observed that polymorphism rs2301022 of the  GCLM  gene is strongly associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke regardless of sex and age. In addition, SNP rs648595 of the  GCLC  gene was associated with increased stroke risk, but at a borderline statistical level. Two haplotypes, such as A-G-G-C-C-G of  GCLC  and C-T-T of  GCLM,  were associated with an increased and decreased risk of ischemic stroke, respectively. However, haplotype association analysis stratiﬁed by tobacco smoking status showed that two common haplotypes such as A-C-C and C-T-T of  GCLM possess protective effects against the risk of ischemic stroke, but exclusively in nonsmokers. GCLC  polymorphisms rs636933 and rs761142, as well as two haplotypes of  GCLM,  were associated with an increased volume of brain infarction in patients with ischemic stroke. The relationship between polymorphism rs2301022 of  GCLM  and the risk of large artery atherosclerosis was revealed in the Spanish cohort. Furthermore, SNP rs761142, which was associated with brain infarct size, has been found to be associated with the risk of large artery atherosclerosis in a mixed cohort (MEGASTROKE) GWAS. Some polymorphisms of  GCLC  (rs12524494, rs606548, and rs17883901) and  GCLM  (rs3827715 and rs7517826) genes that did not show associations with risk of ischemic stroke in our population were associated with disease risk at least in one independent population. The analysis of linkage d is equilibrium between DNA polymorphisms revealed that inter population differences in the association of alleles with ischemic stroke risk appear to be attributed to features of the haplotype structure of genes in the studied populations.  

Modeling gene–gene and gene–environment interactions by the  mbmdr  method showed that polymorphisms at  GCLC  and  GCLM  are involved in epistatic interactions with known candidate genes for ischemic stroke, and their effects on disease susceptibility are comparable with those loci identiﬁed by large-scale, genome-wide association studies. However, the contribution of  GCLC  and  GCLM  gene polymorphisms to the volume of brain infarction is greater than the studied GWAS loci. Differences in the associations of  GCLC  and  GCLM gene polymorphisms with ischemic stroke risk and brain infarct size may be explained by the fact that SNPs have different functional effects in the carotid arteries and brain, and these effects can be modulated through epigenetic mechanisms such as methyl ation and histone modi cation, as has been identiﬁed by the bioinformatics analysis. The strongest gene–gene interactions contributing to the risk of ischemic stroke were found between SNP rs2301022 of the  GCLM  gene and two GWAS loci, such as rs4322086 of  RASEF  and rs12449964 of  PEMT  (exact biological functions of these genes remain unknown), suggesting that the studied genes are part of a complex genetic predisposition to ischemic stroke.  

It is also important to note that the synergic effects of the genes on ischemic stroke risk and brain infarct size are triggered by environmental factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse, hypo dyna mia, and fruit and vegetable intake that are well-recognized risk factors for cerebro vascular disease. Bioinformatics analysis showed that polymorphisms of the  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes are functionally important regions involved in the regulation of gene expression in the vas cula ture and brain through epigenetic mechanisms and allele-speciﬁc binding with transcription factors. The rs2301022 polymorphism of the GCLM  gene showed the most signiﬁcant association with the risk of ischemic stroke. Bioinformatics analysis showed no phenotypic effects of this polymorphism on gene expression, and there are no studies that have investigated the impact of this SNP on the expression levels of  GCLM . However, we found that the rs2301022 SNP is part of a common haplotype rs2301022T-rs3827715T-rs7517826C of the  GCLM  gene, which was associated with a protective effect against the risk of ischemic stroke. Since the rs3827715- T and rs7517826-C alleles are associated with a higher level of transcriptional activity of the  GCLM  gene in the arteries and in some parts of the brain, this indicates that the rs2301022-T allele, apparently, is also associated with increased expression of the gene, thereby enhancing the synthesis of glut at hi one. It is noteworthy that a strong protective effect of the rs2301022-T/T  GCLM  genotype on the risk of ischemic stroke was seen in the suppression of the negative effects of polymorphic genes such as rs4322086 of  RASEF and rs12449964 of  PEMT  that have been found to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke [ 55 , 56 ]. In addition, bioinformatics analysis allowed us to show that SNPs rs636933 and rs761142 of  GCLC  and rs2301022 of  GCLM  are signiﬁcant eQTLs with loss-of-function  effects of alternative alleles on gene expression in the brain, suggesting that an increase in brain infarct size might be the result of a decrease in the expression and/or activity of the genes that lead to a reduced synthesis of glut at hi one. A study in the British population [ 57 ] conﬁrmed our ﬁnding that the rs2301022 SNP of the  GCLM  gene is associated with the volume of brain damage following stroke. Thus, despite inter population differences in the associations between the gene polymorphisms and stroke phenotypes identiﬁed by replication analysis, the present study clearly shows that genetic variation in both catalytic and modiﬁer subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase determines ischemic stroke susceptibility and brain infarct size, highlighting the importance of  GCLC  and  GCLM gene polymorphisms for both the molecular pathogen es is of ischemic stroke and disease severity. Thus, functional annotation of SNPs showed that SNPs rs636933 and rs761142 of the  GCLC  gene and rs2301022 of the  GCLM  gene are characterized by statistically signiﬁcant loss-of-function effects of minor alleles on the expression of the corresponding genes in brain and vas cula ture tissues. The increase in the area of ischemic damage appears to be the result of a low glut at hi one level caused by the decrease in the expression and/or activity of the  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes.  

It is known that interactions between genetic and environmental factors are jointly involved in the development of ischemic stroke. The ﬁndings obtained by our study support this concept. The  mbmdr  method discovered that well-known environmental risk factors for ischemic stroke, such as chronic stress [ 58 ], physical inactivity [ 59 ], cigarette smoking [ 60 ], alcohol abuse [ 61 ], and in suf cie nt consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits [ 62 ], showed the strongest contribution to disease development in combination with polymorphisms of the  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes, as well as some GWAS loci. The vast majority of   $\mathrm{GxE}$   models comprise combinations of one or more of these environmental factors. An in-depth analysis of the literature has led us to the assumption that endogenous glut at hi one deﬁciency may be a shared condition that occurs as a result of the inﬂuence of these risk factors. This assumption is based on the fact that chronic stress, alcohol abuse, and smoking might be responsible for the depletion of glut at hi one [ 63 – 68 ], whereas moderate physical activity and high levels of consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits contribute to an increase in endogenous biosynthesis of glut at hi one [ 69 – 71 ]. In particular, it is known that short-term emotional stress can cause positive changes in the activity of enzymes involved in the synthesis of glut at hi one [ 72 ]. However, chronic stress is associated with the depletion of endogenous glut at hi one, as has been clearly demonstrated by experimental studies, including in brain tissues [ 73 , 74 ]. Regular consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits, which contain up to  $70\%$   of dietary glut at hi one and its precursors, including a balanced amount of amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemical s, contributes to a signiﬁcant increase in endogenous glut at hi one levels [ 71 , 75 ]. Interestingly, increasing the intake of fresh fruits and vegetables (e.g., green leafy vegetables and citrus fruits, including juice) by one serving per day is associated with a   $6\%$   reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke [ 62 ].  

Glutamate-cysteine ligase is a he te rod im eric enzyme consisting of a heavy catalytic subunit and a light modiﬁer subunit that are expressed by different genes [ 76 ], and interactions between the subunits determine the catalytic efﬁciency of this enzyme. Activity of glutamate-cysteine ligase and up regulation of  GCLC  gene expression may be induced in response to oxidative stress and GSH depletion through the activation of regulatory elements in the gene promoter [ 77 ]. It is known that biosynthesis of GSH in brain cells depends on their ability to uptake extracellular amino acid precursors of glut at hi one (glutamate, cysteine, and glycine) and/or synthesize sufﬁcient substrates to produce their own GSH. Notably, uptake and metabolism of GSH precursors differ by brain cell type. Unlike neurons, astrocytes can use a variety of amino acids and peptides, which are taken up by excitatory amino acid carrier 1 and converted into substrate amino acids for glutamatecysteine ligase and glut at hi one synthetase [ 78 ].  

The present and previous studies [ 79 – 81 ] clearly show that polymorphisms of key genes involved in glut at hi one biosynthesis such as  GCLC ,  GCLM ,  GSS  (glut at hi one synthase), and  GGCT  (gamma-glut amyl cy clo transfer as e) are important contributors to the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke. Together with the environmental factors discussed above, these genes determine the level of glut at hi one metabolism and thus can modulate intracellular GSH content. The study results point out that loss-of-function variants in genes for glut at hi one metabolizing enzymes along with environmental factors increase the risk of development and severity of cerebro vascular disease through the development of glutathione deﬁciency. What is the path o physiological sign i can ce of impaired glut at hi one synthesis for the development and progression of cerebro vascular disease? Glut at hi one deﬁciency in the vas cula ture and brain tissues may contribute to the multistep pathogen es is of cerebro vascular disease. Glut at hi one deﬁciency may have a path o genetic role in all three stages of cerebro vascular disease, such as (1) atherosclerosis of cerebral arteries, (2) acute occlusion of the cerebral artery, and (3) ischemic injury of the brain. Glut at hi one has been shown to be an important intra vascular regulator involved in the control of endo the li al growth and the protection of endo the li al cells from oxidative damage, in amma tion, and atherosclerosis [ 82 , 83 ].  

Atherosclerosis has been associated with decreased expression of GSH-dependent antioxidant enzymes and an associated decline in glut at hi one [ 82 , 84 , 85 ]. A prospective study performed on mice showed that reduced levels of GSH in the aorta are detected both before the onset of atherosclerosis and during its development and progression [ 86 ]. It has also been found that the expression level of the  GCLM  gene is decreased in carotid arteries affected by atherosclerosis compared to intact internal mammary arteries [ 87 ]. In addition, hypo methyl ation of CpG sites at the  GCLM  gene in blood leukocytes was found to be associated with acute cerebral stroke [ 88 ]. Carotid intima-media thickness, an indicator of carotid and generalized atherosclerosis [ 89 , 90 ], is negatively associated with blood GSH levels [ 91 ], providing additional evidence for the role of glut at hi one deﬁciency in atherosclerosis of cerebral arteries. Cho and co-workers observed that the increase in GSH by oxidized low density lipoprotein s (OxLDL) may afford cellular protection against OxLDL-induced oxidative stress, impairing endo the li al cells as an initial step in at hero genesis [ 92 ]. Moreover, it has been established that glut at hi one deﬁciency reduces the bio availability of nitric oxide, resulting in the development of endo the li al dysfunction, which is a key path o physiological change in atherosclerosis [ 93 ]. Deﬁciency of reduced glut at hi one has been revealed in cerebro vascular disease [ 24 ] and in the acute phase of ischemic stroke [ 94 ], thereby contributing to more severe brain damage, as has been demonstrated by numerous studies [ 95 – 99 ]. It has been demonstrated that the severity of ischemic stroke correlates directly with the level of glut at hi one deﬁciency [ 100 ].  

The brain has a moderate antioxidant capacity, and this limited ability to neutralize ROS makes brain tissues more susceptible to oxidative stress than other organs and tissues, contributing to the development of pathological processes including ischemic stroke [ 9 , 101 ]. Cerebral vessels are the main targets of oxidative stress, which actually plays a decisive role in the formation of ischemic damage to brain tissues and determines the severity of stroke [ 102 ]. High levels of glut at hi one are essential not only for the protection of the central nervous system against oxidative stress but also for normal brain functioning [ 78 ]. First, glut at hi one may represent a ph y sio logic reservoir of glutamate, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in cortical synapses, which is known to participate in many ph y sio logic and pathologic processes, including stroke [ 103 ]. Second, glut at hi one has been proven to play a crucial role in brain ischemia resistance by reducing the loss of nerve function and apoptosis of neuronal cells [ 104 , 105 ]. In humans, an age-dependent decline in GSH has also been found to increase the extent of neuronal injury following ischemic stroke [ 106 , 107 ]. It has been established that astrocytes with glut at hi one deﬁciency lose their neuro protective function, resulting in a decrease in neuron viability and death [ 108 ]. Elevation of GSH after acute stroke is considered to be a part of acute adaptive neuro pro tective mechanisms during acute stroke [ 109 ]. A decrease in reduced glut at hi one was found to cause protein nitration, S-nitro syl ation, as well as the formation of DNA strand breaks in neuronal cells [ 12 ]. Moreover, glut at hi one depletion is an important factor for decreased neuronal viability, apoptosis initiation, and execution [ 110 – 112 ]. Howarth and co-workers demonstrated that production of the va so dil at or prostaglandin E2 in astrocytes is critically dependent on brain levels of glut at hi one, and decreased levels of glut at hi one will lead to dysfunctional cerebral blood ﬂow regulation, resulting in subsequent neuronal damage [ 113 ]. Glut at hi one was found to reduce in amma tion and neuronal cell death following brain injury [ 111 ]. Reduced glut at hi one is known to mediate antioxidant responses in the brain, providing a critical defense system for the protection of cells from oxidative stress as well as serving a central role in repairing brain damage after ischemic stroke [ 16 , 106 ]. Finally, it has been experimentally observed that glut at hi one has the potential to stimulate neuro repair and functional recovery after ischemic stroke [ 114 ].  

Finally, glut at hi one deﬁciency may be the cause of impaired protein folding, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and the induction of neuronal cell death following ischemic stroke. The formation of disulﬁde bonds in maturing proteins is required for their correct tertiary structure, and this process takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is heavily inﬂuenced by glut at hi one, one of the key players in ensuring pro teo stasis in all types of cells [ 115 , 116 ]. Oxidized and reduced forms of glut at hi one play distinct functions in protein folding: GSSG, being an oxidant, forms disulﬁde bonds in a protein, whereas GSH, being a reducing agent, cleaves misbridged disulﬁde bonds [ 116 , 117 ]. Glut at hi one deﬁciency appears to reduce ischemic neurons’ ability to ensure the efﬁciency of the protein folding process in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing it to become overloaded with misfolded proteins. Thus, there is reason to believe that glut at hi one deﬁciency in the cell is the key factor responsible for ineffective protein folding and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER, culminating in activation of the unfolded protein response and cell apoptosis. Importantly, impaired pro teo stasis is a major cause of neuronal cell death in ischemic stroke. Ischemic injury of the brain initiates ER stress or unfolded protein response, an adaptive process with the activation of pro survival mechanisms for the recovery of brain damage after cerebral ischemia [ 118 , 119 ]. However, chronic ER stress plays a detrimental role in nerve cells via triggering diverse pro a pop to tic pathways [ 118 , 119 ].  

There are some limitations in the present study that should be addressed. The present study examined a limited number of polymorphisms in the  GCLC  and  GCLM  genes. Therefore, further studies with a larger number of SNPs are required to assess the comprehensive contribution of the genes to the risk of ischemic stroke and post ischemic damage to the brain. Furthermore, the observed associations need to be conﬁrmed in independent populations. Low statistical power did not allow detection of reliable estimates of the effects of polymorphisms on glut at hi one levels because the sample size of IS patients with biochemical investigations of redox homeostasis was too small. A relatively low sample size of the studied population did not allow us to identify gene–environment interactions involving risk factors such as chronic stress, physical inactivity, alcohol abuse, and decreased intake of fresh vegetables and fruits, all of which play a role in the etiology of ischemic stroke.  

# 5. Conclusions  

Our study was the ﬁrst to show that genetic variation in subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase, a key and rate-limiting enzyme for glut at hi one biosynthesis, contributes to the risk of ischemic stroke and brain infarct size. We found that polymorphisms of the  GCLC  and GCLM  genes are in tight epistatic interactions with known genes responsible for the risk of ischemic stroke and determining the volume of brain infarction. The multi factorial nature of ischemic stroke is supported by our ﬁndings that the synergic effects of the studied genes on disease susceptibility and brain infarct size are triggered by well-recognized environmental risk factors for cerebro vascular disease. Understanding the role of glut at hi one metabolism disorders caused by the interaction of environmental and genetic factors opens the door to developing new methods for the treatment and prevention of ischemic stroke and its consequences. In particular, N-acetyl cyst eine and glycine supplement ation for the replenishment of endogenous glut at hi one deﬁciency is widely regarded as a promising approach to the primary prevention of atherosclerosis and neuro protective therapy for ischemic stroke and its severity [ 82 , 101 , 120 , 121 ]. Finally, the present study supports the urgent need for clinical trials focusing on intravenous administration of reduced glut at hi one as an adjuvant therapy in the acute phase of ischemic stroke with the goal of protecting neurons from oxidative damage and alleviation of disease outcomes.
