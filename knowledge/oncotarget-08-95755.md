# ABSTRACT  

We investigated whether three common microRNA polymorphisms (miR-21T>C  [rs1292037], miR-126G>A [rs4636297] and miR-605T  ${\tt>c}$   [rs2043556]) were  associated with ischemic stroke (IS) risk in a Chinese population. The study population  comprised 592 ischemic stroke patients and 456 normal controls. The polymorphisms  were measured using Snapshot SNP genotyping assays and confirmed by sequencing.  Relative expressions of miR-21, miR-126 and miR-605 were measured by quantitative  real-time PCR. We found that miR-126 gene rs4636297 polymorphism was associated  with decreased ischemic stroke risk (GA vs. GG:   ${\tt A O R}{=}0.64,$  , adjust  $\scriptstyle{\mathsf{P}}={\pmb{0}}.{\pmb{0}}25;$  ; AA vs. GG:   ${\tt A O R}{=}0.32,$   adjust  $\scriptstyle{\pmb{\mathsf{P}}=\pmb{\mathsf{0}}.\pmb{\mathsf{0}}\pmb{\mathsf{0}}7;}$  ; dominant model:  ${\tt A o R}{=}0.58,$  , adjust  $\scriptstyle{\pmb{\mathsf{P}}}={\pmb{\mathsf{0}}}.{\pmb{\mathsf{004}}}$  ). MiR-21 gene  rs1292037 and miR-605 gene rs2043556 polymorphisms were not associated with  ischemic stroke risk. In addition, compared with normal controls, serum miR-126 level  was significantly decreased in ischemic stroke patients, while the miR-21 level was  significantly increased. Importantly, patients carrying rs4636297 GA/AA genotypes  had higher serum miR-126 level   $\scriptstyle(\mathbf{P}<\mathbf{0}.\mathbf{05})$  ). MiR-126 gene rs4636297 polymorphism and  serum miR-126/-21 levels are associated with ischemic stroke risk. Our data indicates  that miR-126 and miR-21 play roles in the development of ischemic stroke.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Ischemic stroke is a common cerebral blood  circulation disorder disease which is a serious threat to  human health. It is the second leading cause of death in  China [1]. Its growing trend of prevalence deserves the  attention of medical community worldwide. Common  risk factors, such as age, gender, smoking, hypertension  and abnormal lipid metabolism account for part of the  prevalence of ischemic stroke [2–5]. Genetic factors  have been defined as important risk contributors to the  pathogen es is of ischemic stroke [6–8].  

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are class of small noncoding single-stranded RNAs molecules of about 21-23  nucleotides in length, which involve in regulating gene  expressions and contribute to various disease pathogen es is,  such as inflammation, cancer, atherosclerosis, and  ischemic stroke [9–13]. Atherosclerosis start from the  dysfunction endo the li al cells (ECs) which was regard  to be a major cause of ischemic stroke. ECs enriched  microRNAs, such as miR-21 and miR-126 have been  found to be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis  by modulating the function of ECs [14, 15]. For instance,  miR-21 involved in the regulation of ang io genesis  mediated by ECs [16]; microRNA-126-5p promotes  endo the li al proliferation and limits atherosclerosis by  suppressing DIk1 [17]. In addition, the serum level of  miR-21 and miR-126 were significantly changed in  

ischemic stroke and atherosclerosis patients [18–20]. The  exact mechanism of the abnormal miR-21 and miR-126  expression remain unclear and genetic factors may play  key roles in this process [21].  

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in microRNAs  were related to individual’s susceptibility to a number of  human diseases [22–24]. Polymorphisms in microRNAs  were reported to be associated with ischemic stroke  risk [25–27]. Recently, three common microRNA  polymorphisms (  $\mathrm{minR{-}126G{>}A}$  : rs4636297, chromosome  9, 139565150; miR-21T>C: rs1292037, chromosome 17,  57918908; miR $605\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$  : rs2043556, chromosome 10,  53059406) have been investigated in a variety of human  diseases [28–34]. Up to now, no report was performed  to examine the association between these three common  SNPs (i.e. rs4636297, rs2043556 and rs1292037) and  ischemic stroke risk. Based on this background, we  hypothesized that these three polymorphisms may relate  to ischemic stroke risk. Therefore, we performed the study  in a Chinese population, for the first time, to evaluate the  association between   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$  ,   $\mathrm{rs}2043556\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$  and rs  $1292037\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$   polymorphisms and ischemic stroke  susceptibility and to assess the associations between these  three polymorphisms and the expression levels of miR21/-126/-605.  

# RESULTS  

# Clinical characteristics of the study participants  

The clinical characteristics of the study subjects  were shown in Table 1. There is no significant difference  between cases and controls with regard to age   $(\mathrm{P{=}0.884})$  ),  gender   $(\mathrm{P{=}}0.609)$  ) and HDL-C levels   $(\mathrm{P{=}}0.200)$  ). Ischemic  stroke patients were significantly more likely to smoke and  have higher percentage of diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  as well as high serum TC, TG and LDL-C levels (both   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.05.$  ).  

# Genotype distributions of the three microRNAs  polymorphisms in patients and controls  

All of the polymorphisms have three genotypes  respectively. The genotype and allele frequencies of  rs4636297, rs1292037 and rs2043556 polymorphisms  in case and control groups were shown in Table 2. The  genotype distributions of the three polymorphisms in both  cases and controls were in HWE (both  $\mathrm{P{>}}0.05$  ). The power  of rs 4636297 polymorphism was 0.99. We calculated  the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) from logistic regression  analyses with respect to age, gender, hypertension,  diabetes mellitus, smoking, TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C.  Compared with rs4636297 GG genotype, rs4636297 GA  and AA genotypes were significantly associated with  decreased risk of ischemic stroke (GA vs. GG:  $\mathrm{AOR}{=}0.64$  ,   $95\%$   CI, 0.44-0.95,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.025$  ; AA vs. GG: AOR  $\scriptstyle\cdot=0.32$  ,  $95\%$  CI, 0.14-0.74,   $\mathrm{P{=}}0.007$  ; dominant model,   $\mathrm{\AA+GA}$   vs.  GG: AOR  $\mathord{=}0.58$  ,  $95\%$   CI, 0.40-0.84,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.004$  ). However,  rs1292037 and rs2043556 polymorphisms were not  significantly associated with ischemic stroke risk.  

# Stratified analyses  

Stratified  analyses  based  on  age,  gender,  hypertension,  smoke,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  hyper lipid emi a were performed to find additional clinical  significance. According to the results, we failed to find  any association between these three polymorphisms and  clinical characteristics of ischemic stroke. (Table 3)  

# Relative expressions of miR-21, miR-126 and  miR-605  

Relative serum miR-21, miR-126 and miR-605  levels were detected in both ischemic stroke patients  and control subjects. Serum levels of miR-126 were  significantly decreased in stroke patients compared with  normal controls (IS vs. control  $\c=6.57\pm1.50$   vs.  $9.86{\pm}1.92\$  ,   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$  ; Figure 1A). Patients carrying rs 4636297 GA/ AA genotypes had significant higher serum levels of  miR-126 (GG vs.   $\mathrm{GA/AAA=}6.08\pm1.47$   vs.   $7.53{\pm}2.00$  ,   $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$  ; Figure 1B). In normal controls rs  $4636297\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  polymorphism did not associated with serum miR-126  level (GG vs. GA/AA  $\mathbf{\lambda=}9.77{\pm}1.67$   vs.   $10.6{\pm}1.19\$  ,   $\mathrm{~P~}=$  0.485; Figure 1C). MiR-21 was significantly increased in  ischemic stroke patients (IS vs. control  $=\!34.65\!\pm\!7.26$   vs.   $26.89{\pm}6.81$  ,  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.001$  ). But, r  $\Im{1292037\mathrm{T}}{>}\mathrm{C}$   polymorphism  did not associated with the expression of miR-21(IS: TT  vs.   $\Gamma\mathrm{C/CC=}32.5{\pm}5.80$   vs.   $35.27{\pm}8.70$  ,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.203$  ; Control:  TT vs.   $\mathrm{TC/CC=}25.64\pm6.94$   vs.   $27.51{\scriptstyle\pm6.75}$  ,   $\mathrm{P{=}}0.320$  ,  respectively). Serum miR-605 levels between patients  and controls showed no significant difference (IS vs.  control  $\mid=21.03\pm8.53$   vs.   $19.21{\scriptstyle\pm9.15}$  ,  $\mathrm{P{=}}0.262$  ). Besides,  serum miR-605 levels did not associated with any  genotype of rs2043556  $\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$   polymorphism (IS: TT vs.   $\mathrm{TC/CC=}21.26\pm9.19$   vs.   $20.70{\scriptstyle\pm7.68}$  ,   $\mathrm{P{=}}0.802$  ; Control:  TT vs.   $\mathrm{TC/CC=}20.12\pm8.65$   vs.   $17.93{\pm}9.85$  ,   $\mathrm{P}{=}0.363$  ,  respectively).  

# DISCUSSION  

This is the first study to evaluate the association  between three common microRNA polymorphisms   $\mathrm{(rs4636297G{>}A}$  ,   $\mathrm{s}1292037\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$   and   $\mathrm{rs}2043556\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C})$  )  and ischemic stroke risk in a Chinese population. We  demonstrated for the first time that miR-126 gene   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$   polymorphism was associated with a  reduced risk of ischemic stroke. Moreover, patients  carrying rs4636297 GA/AA genotypes had a higher level  of miR-126. These results indicated that miR-126 gene   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$   polymorphism may play a role in the  progression of ischemic stroke.

Hyper lipid emi a: Hyper lipid emi a was defined as a high fasting serum total cholesterol level   $\left(>6.22\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L}\right)$   or an  anti hyper lipid emi c agent treatment history, TC: total cholesterol, TG: triglyceride, HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.  

Atherosclerosis is a hyper lipid emi a-induced chronic  inflammatory process of the arterial wall, resulting from  the disturbed endo the li al cells (ECs). It was regard to be  a major cause of stroke. The integrity of the endo the li al  monolayer is fundamental for the homo eo stasis of the  vascular system, and functional endo the li al cells are  also required for the growth of new blood vessels during  neo vascular iz ation [16], endo the li al cell functions and  ang io genesis are critically regulated by microRNAs,  including miR-126, miR-143 and miR-145 et al [35].  The endo the li al cell-specific miR-126 is transferred in  micro-vesicles from apoptotic endo the li al cells and plays  important roles in vascular inflammation related diseases,  including chronic kidney disease [36, 37], atherosclerosis  [38, 39] and stroke [10]. In ischemic stroke etiology, miR126 modulates the pathogenic processes of atherosclerosis  thereby affecting the stroke progression [40]. These  studies indicated that miR-126 may play important role  in the development of ischemic stroke. However, the  association between   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$  polymorphism in  miR-126 gene and ischemic stroke risk remains unclear.  

MiR-126 gene is located in chromosome   $9\mathrm{q}34.3$  within the host gene encoding epidermal growth factor-like  protein 7 (EGFL7) [41]. Several reports have explored the  association between   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$   polymorphism and  human disease susceptibility. Results were inconsistent.  Rs4636297   $\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$   polymorphism was not associated  with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer risk  [29, 30]. While, another report indicated that A allele  of   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$  can impair the inhibition of mature  miR-126 to increase VEGF promotion and increase the  risk for developing sight threatening diabetic ret in opa thy  (STDR) [34]. In addition, a functional study revealed that  both major G and minor A allele of   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$   can  blocks the processing of primary miR-126 to precursory  miR-126 and resulting in significantly reduced mature  miR-126 expression, although the block effect of minor A  allele is less effective [21]. In this study, we investigated  the association between miR-126 gene   $\mathrm{rs}4636297\mathrm{G}{>}$   A  polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk and the miR-126  expression. According to the results, we found that miR126 gene   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$   polymorphism was associated  with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke and serum level  of miR-126 was significantly reduced in stroke patients.  Besides, patients carrying GA/AA genotypes had higher  miR-126 levels compared with those carrying GG  genotypes. With regard to the potential mechanism, we  speculated that   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$   polymorphism may  exert influence on the processing of primary miR-126 to  precursory miR-126 in ischemic stroke patients. Owing  to the relative low inhibiting functions of A allele,  patients carrying GA/AA genotypes had a higher level  of miR-126 compared with those carrying GG genotype.  However, we should not ignore the fact that in normal  controls the miR-126 levels did not associated with any   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$   genotypes. The reason of this difference  remains unclear; a possible explanation may be that the  miR-126 expression is inducible and its expression is  changed after stimulation. The miR-126 levels may be  determined by both genetic and inducing factors. Further  gene-environment interaction analysis may better reveal  the role of miR-126 gene polymorphisms in the etiology  of ischemic stroke.  

Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-enriched miR21 was involved in the pathogen es is of atherosclerosis  related disease [42]. Consistent with previous studies,  we also detected significantly increased serum miR-21  levels in ischemic stroke patients. However, the current

data did not support the association between miR-21 gene  rs1292037  $\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$   polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk.  

Rs2043556T/C polymorphism of miR-605 gene was  related to certain human diseases [31, 32]. A recent report  showed that rs2043556T/C did not associated with the  recurrence of ischemic stroke [43]. In present study we  found that rs2043556T/C also did not associated with the  ischemic stroke risk. Serums miR-605 levels also showed  no significant difference between patients and controls.  Besides, rs2043556T/C polymorphism did not associated  with serum miR-605 level. These findings suggested that  miR-605 gene rs2043556T/C polymorphism may not play  role in the progression of ischemic stroke.  

Although our results are promising, it should be  noted that our study have several limitations. First, all  subjects may not give the same battery of diagnostic  clinical and laboratory tests; therefore, potential selection  bias could not be ruled out and might influence the  interpretation of the results. Further independent validation  studies are required to confirm the stability of the current  findings. Second, relative small sample size was selected  to detect the serum microRNAs levels; the results should  be further validated in larger sample studies. Third, for  the loss of stroke subtype information, we could not  analyze the role of microRNA polymorphisms in different  subtypes of ischemic stroke. Finally, more advanced  statistical methods and validation experiments should  be applied to subsequent studies to explore the exact  regulatory mechanism of miRNA gene polymorphisms in  ischemic stroke.  

In  summary,  miR-126  gene   $\mathrm{rs4636297G{>}A}$    polymorphism was associated with decreased risk of

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Study subjects  

The study was performed with the approval of the  ethics committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang  Medical University for Nationalities, and written informed  consent was obtained from all the subjects. The experiments  were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and  regulations. The study included 592 ischemic stroke patients  (367 males and 225 females) from the Department of  Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University  for Nationalities, Guangxi, China between January 2013 and  September 2015. The diagnosis of ischemic stroke was based  on the appearance of a new and abrupt focal neurological  deficit, with neurological symptoms and signs persisting for  more than  $24\mathrm{h}$  . Ischemic stroke was confirmed by the positive  findings by head CT or MRI according to the International  Classification of Disease (9th Revision, codes 430 to 438).  Patients with hemorrhagic stroke, coronary heart disease,  autoimmune diseases, cancers or other serious diseases were  excluded from the study. The 456 sexes- and age- matched  controls (275 males and 181 females) were selected from  volunteers who underwent physical examination in health  examination center, Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical  University for Nationalities, Guangxi, China during the same  period. Confirmed by head CT, MRI scanning (negative  imaging finding) and thorough clinical and laboratory  evaluation, the healthy volunteers meeting the same exclusion  criteria as the cases were enrolled in this study.  

Clinical information, such as hypertension, diabetes,  fasting serum levels of total cholesterol (TCH), triglyceride  (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was abstracted from  medical record review. All study subjects were Chinese and  resided in the same geographic area in Guangxi China.  

# SNPs selection  

We  selected  three  common  microRNA  polymorphisms (mi  $_{\mathrm{R-}21\mathrm{T>C}}$   [rs1292037], miR $126\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  [rs4636297] and miR $.605\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$   [rs2043556]) which have  been identified in a variety of human diseases [28–34].  

# DNA extraction  

Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leucocytes  by using a whole-blood genome DNA extraction reagent  kit [Axygene Biotechnology (Hangzhou) Limited  (Hangzhou City, China)], following the manufacturers’  instructions.  

# Determination of genotype  

The method of Snapshot SNP genotyping assay  was taken to detect the allele and genotype frequencies.  To confirm the genotyping results, PCR-amplified DNA  samples were examined by DNA sequencing and the  results were   $100\%$   concordant. The PCR primers were  designed based on the GenBank reference sequence  (accession no. miR-126: NC_000009.12; miR-21:  NC_000017.11; miR-605: NC_000010.11).  

# Quantitative PCR of microRNAs  

In all patients, plasma samples were collected within  12h after symptom onset. After an overnight fasting, venous  blood samples of control population were collected. Plasma  was isolated by cent ri fuga tion and was maintained at  $-70\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  until use. 120 stroke patients and 120 normal controls were  randomly selected to detecting serum microRNAs levels.  Total RNA was isolated using a commercial kit (Qiagen,  Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol.  One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed into  cDNA utilizing reverse transcription kits from Ribobio  Corp. (Guangzhou, China). After cDNA conversion,  quantitative PCR was done using Power SYBR Master  Mix and ABI 7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, CA, and USA). We purchased the primers from  Ribobio Corp., (Guangzhou, China). U6 was used as an  internal control. Relative expression levels of microRNAs  were computed using comparative Ct method   $(2^{-\Delta\mathrm{C}\mathrm{t}})$  .  

# Statistical analysis  

The SPSS statistical software package version 17.0  was used for the statistical analysis. Continuous variables  were displayed as mean  $\pm$  SD. If the data were normally  distributed, the Student’s t-test was used; otherwise,  Mann-Whitney U test was used. Categorical variables  were expressed as proportions and compared by using  chi-squared test. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)  was tested by chi-squared test. The association of the miR $126\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{A}$  , miR $21\mathrm{T}\mathrm{>}\mathrm{C}$   and miR $.605\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$   polymorphisms  and risk of ischemic stroke was evaluated by odds ratios  (ORs) with  $95\%$   confidence interval (CIs). For multivariate  analyses, logistic regression analyses were used to adjust  for possible con founders, including age, sex, hypertension,  diabetes mellitus, smoking, TCH, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C.  The power analysis was performed using NCSS-PASS 11.0.  Statistical significance was accepted at the  $\mathrm{P}{<}0.05$   level.
