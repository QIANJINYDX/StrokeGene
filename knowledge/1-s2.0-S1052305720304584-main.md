Background:  Emotional disturbances, such as anxiety and depression are common after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Individual variation in emotional outcome is strongly in ﬂ uenced by genetic factors. One of pituitary axis, is the hypothalami cpituitary-thyroid axis, a critical regulator of post-stroke recovery, suggesting that allelic variants in thyroid hormone (TH) signaling regulation can in ﬂ uence stroke outcome.  Aim:  To determine associations between AIS emotional outcome and allelic variants of the TH metabolizing enzymes 1  3 type deiodinase (DIO1-3) and the membrane transporting organic anion polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1). Methods:  Eligible AIS patients from Lithuania   $(n{=}168)$   were genotyped for ten DIO1-3 and OATP1C1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP): DIO1 rs12095080- A/G, rs11206244-C/T, and rs2235544-A/C; DIO2 rs225014-T/C and rs225015-G/ A; DIO3 rs945006-T/G; OATP1C1 rs974453-G/A, rs10444412-T/C, rs10770704-C/ T, and rs1515777-A/G. Emotional outcome was evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at discharge from the neurology department after experienced index AIS.  Results:  After adjustment for potential con founders, the major allelic (wild-type) DIO1-rs12095080 genotype (AA) was associated with higher odds ratio of anxiety symptoms   $(\mathrm{OR}=5.16)$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 1.04  25.58;  $\mathsf{p}\,{=}\,0.045,$  ), conversely, DIO1-rs11206244 wild-type genotype (CC) and wild-type OATP1C1- rs1515777 allele containing the genotypes   $(\mathrm{AA}+\mathrm{AC})$   were associated with lower odds ratio of symptoms of anxiety   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.37)$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 0.14  0.96;   ${\tt p}\!=\!0.041$   and  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,0.30,$  ;   $95\%$   CI: 0.12  0.76;   ${\tt p}\!=\!0.011$  rs974453 genotype (GG) was associated with higher odds ratio of symptoms of depression   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.73$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 1.04  7.12;  ${\tt p}\!=\!0.041$  ).  Allelic variants in thyroid axis genes may predict emotional outcomes of AIS.

# 1. Introduction  

Mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression, are common after stroke. It was reported, that post-stroke anxiety cumulative incidence reached  $57\%$   within the  ﬁ rst ten years after stroke was experienced.   This mental health problem after stroke leads to impaired quality of life 1   and poorer activity of daily living.   Recent meta-analysis established, that the risk of stroke in a person with  

symptoms of anxiety is even higher compared to the risk of coronary heart disease or heart failure.   Moreover, anxiety disorder comorbid with symptoms of depression after stroke was associated with increased lethal outcomes. Post-stroke depression, diagnosed in approximately onein-three of stroke survivors,   was also associated with increased risk of executive impairment,   recurrent ischemic stroke,   and mortality.  

Stroke, as with other diseases, induces response from other systems including the neuro endocrine pituitary axes. In the last years more attention has been drawn to the axis composed of the hypothalamus, hypophysis and thyroid (thyroid axis) dedicated to keeping optimal levels of serum thyroid hormones (TH), prohormone tetraiodothyronine (T4) and the active hormone tr iio do thy ronin e (T3).   In critically ill patients the most frequently determined alteration of pituitary hormonal axis was thyroid axis suppression.   In the case of stroke, thyroid axis participation shows frequently determined thyroid serum parameter alterations, usually manifesting as low T3 syndrome,   making it an effective prognostic marker of worse stroke outcomes as was showed in recently performed meta-analyses. ,   Furthermore, a systematic review on thyroid axis functioning in patients with anxiety disorders, revealed weak response of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level to administered thy ro liber in, thus showing brain-thyroid interaction in genesis of anxiety associated symptoms.   It is hypothesized that in fear related mouse brain regions, it is amygdala expressing high levels of TH receptors and prefrontal cortex expressing TSH and thy ro liber in receptors, thyroid signals act to modulate fear behavior interacting with other fear modulators such as the cor tico tro pin system.   Regarding stroke, retrospective analysis showed positive associations of post-stroke anxiety and factors such as fatigue and depression.   Experimental and clinical studies suggest, that the main factors associated with post-stroke depression path o physiology are neuro biological, ranging from serotonin transporters genetic polymorphisms to mitochondrial impairment,   neuro endocrine,   and brain circuitry dysfunction.   In the case of thyroid axis, depression was associated with interaction between serotonin ergic system and TH.  

Regulation of the thyroid signal peripherally, within the target tissue, is very precise and tightly regulated relatively irrespective of serum T3 levels through regulation of transmembrane transport, TH activation or in activation through dei odi nation by 1  3 types of dei odin as es (DIO1-3), and TH receptor mediated gene transcription.   One of the most important trans membrane TH transporters within the brain belongs to the organic anion transporter polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1).   This transporter is actively expressed in glial cells astrocytes, which are also the main T3 production site within brain tissue. Here T3 is produced by DIO2 from T4, but excess of T3 is in activated by DIO3 acting within neurons.   The importance of these factors for brain functioning is evident in clinical and experimental data.   De ﬁ - ciency of OATP1C1 due to mutation was associated with juvenile neuro degeneration manifesting with severe neurologic phenotype.   While DIO1-3 human mutations have not yet been described, animal studies with DIO2 knockout gene showed anxiety-like behavior phenotype, possibly because of local hypo thyroid state within emotional brain sites such as amygdala and hippocampus.   Conversely, a study with DIO3 in activating mutation revealed reduced anxiety and depression like phenotype because of a determined brain hyper thyroid state due to T3 excess both in the cortex and hippocampus.  

Other studies showed that genetic polymorphisms in the form of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of these factors associated with local TH bio availability could be linked with various states.   For example, SNP of DIO1 such as DIO1-rs11206244 and DIO1-rs12095080 were associated with body mass and muscle strength, DIO1-rs11206244 with major depression during any point in life,   DIO1-rs2235544 with free T4 (FT4) serum levels. DIO2-rs225014 SNP was associated with cognition in hypo thyroid patients 31   and response to treatment of hypo thyroid is m with combination of TH, thus improving quality of life,   while DIO2-rs225015 was associated with serum TSH levels after thyroid ec to my in patients taking T4.   Recently it was found, that DIO3-rs945006 SNP was associated with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) functional outcomes.   As for OATP1C1 SNP, rs974453 was associated with myocardial infarction (MI),   rs10444412 and rs10770704 with symptoms of depression in adequately treated hypo thyroid patients.   The latter SNP was additionally associated with AIS functional outcomes,   while rs1515777 with free T3 (FT3) serum levels in patients experienced MI.  

Keeping in mind previously mentioned  ﬁ ndings, this study was dedicated to exploring associations between DIO1  3 and OATP1C1 SNP and symptoms of anxiety and depression after AIS was experienced.  

# 2. Methods  

# 2.1. Ethics  

The protocol of a study was approved by the Regional Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (Permission Numbers: P1-BE-2-11/2013, P2-BE-2-11/2013) and is described in detail elsewhere.   Written informed consent was acquired from all study participant directly or from relatives in cases where the patient was unable to sign the consent form due to paralysis, ataxia or vision impairment.  

# 2.2. Study design  

On admission, the following data were recorded: sex, age, neurological impairment according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), level of disability before stroke was evaluated by a modi ﬁ ed Rankin Scale (mRS) through interview with the patient or caregiver in case of communication impairment, presence of increased social risk for anxiety and depression (ISRAD) due to unemployment or retirement before AIS, left carotid territory stroke, applied intravenous thr ombo lysis treatment, arterial blood pressure, use of anti thr ombo tics (i.e., anti ag greg ants, anticoagulant s), history of arterial hypertension (AH), atrial  ﬁ brillation (AF), smoking, diabetes mellitus (DM), previous ischemic stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (PISTIA), peripheral artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI). Arterial hypertension was de ﬁ ned as systolic blood pressure  $\geq140~\mathrm{mmHg},$  , diastolic pressure  $\geq90~\mathrm{mmHg},$  , or consumption of antihypertensive drug. DM was diagnosed by a fasting plasma glucose level  $.\geq7.0\;\mathrm{mmol/L},$   plasma glucose  $\geq11.1\;\mathrm{{mmol}}/$   $\textup{L}2\,\mathrm{h}$   following  $75\:\mathrm{g}$   oral glucose, or consumption of hypoglycemic agents. Patients were considered active smokers if there was data of current active smoking or earlier had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.  

Blood specimens for TH testing and genotyping were collected from all patients on admission within   $48\;\mathrm{h}$   after AIS onset and repeatedly at the end of the  ﬁ rst week. Patients ’  emotional outcomes were evaluated upon discharge from the neurology department following the AIS.  

# 2.3. Study population  

Patients with AIS, admitted to the departments of neurology at Klaipeda University Hospital or the Hospital of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kauno Klinikos over six month period starting from 2013, or to Klaipeda Seamen's Hospital over twelve months period in 2016 were considered for enrolment. Patients were invited into the study if presenting within   $^{48}\mathrm{~h~}$   of AIS onset and between the ages of 18 and 80 years. AIS was determined according to the World Health Organization criteria 38   and con ﬁ rmed by a brain computed tomography scan. In cases with possible AIS mimicking conditions, such as epilepsy, tumor, migraine aura or de myelin a ting disease, brain magnetic resonance tomography was additionally performed. Patients were excluded if they had a known thyroid disease, severe infection, malignancy, communication impairment, severe liver or renal insuf ﬁ ciency, TH pro ﬁ le on admission outside biochemical eu thyroid is m, sub clinical hypo- or hyperthyroidism, low-T3 syndrome, current intake of TH, anti thyroid drugs, steroids, or amiodarone, and iodinated contrast agent exposure within the previous 2 weeks or with failed genotyping. The study recruitment pro ﬁ le is shown in  Fig. 1 . In total 168 patients were included into the study.  

# 2.4. Evaluation of thyroid axis hormones  

The serum levels of TSH, FT3 and FT4 were determined for all included patients. Serum TSH, FT3, and FT4 levels were estimated on admission. Measurements were repeated for eligible patients upon discharge from neurology department. Patients who refused to give consent for blood draw   $(n=5)$  , who died   $(n=16)$  ), who received amiodarone or iodinated contrast agents   $(n=3)$  ), who could not provide the blood sample for other reasons   $(n=6)$   or failed genotyping   $(n=1)$  ) were excluded from the second blood sampling. In total, second blood samples were obtained for 137 patients   $(81.55\%)$  ).  

The serum was separated from the blood by centrifugation at  $3000\ \mathrm{g}$   and then frozen at    $-70\ {}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}.$  . Serum levels of

Fig. 1.  Study recruitment pro ﬁ le.  

TSH, FT3, FT4 were analysed using the electro che milu minescence immuno as say analisator (Advia Centaur XP 2016; Siemens Osakeyhtio). The normal range for FT4 was

 11.50  22.70 pmol/L, FT3   $3.50{-}6.50\ \mathrm{pmol/L},$   and TSH

  $0.55\mathrm{-}4.78~\mathrm{\mu/L};$  ; sub clinical hyperthyroidism for TSH was    $<\,0.550~\mathrm{mU/L}$   and normal levels of FT4, FT3; sub- clinical hypo thyroid is m for TSH was  $>4.780\:\mathrm{mU/L}$   and normal levels of FT4, FT3; low-T3 syndrome for   $\mathrm{FT}3\;<\;$   $3.50\,\mathrm{pmol/L}$   and normal levels of TSH and FT4.  

# 2.5. Genotype analyses  

Blood samples were frozen and stored at    $-70\ {}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}.$  . In this study, we evaluated 10 SNP for thyroid axis-related genes based on an earlier published study 35 : DIO1 rs12095080-A/ G, rs11206244-C/T, and rs2235544-A/C; DIO2 rs225014-T/ C and rs225015-G/A; DIO3 rs945006-T/G; OATP1C1 rs974453-G/A, rs10444412-T/C, rs10770704-C/T, and rs1515777-A/G. SNP were selected on the basis of their established possible in ﬂ uence on various morbid i ties and physiological states, as mentioned earlier. We selected the minor allele according to the 1000 Genomes study (European population) and genetic variation in the Estonian population from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information dbSNP ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ). Genotyping was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the following commercially available SNP assays and TaqMan  Universal Master Mix II, no UNG (all from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA): C_31601225_10 (rs12095080), C_334342_20 (rs11206244), C_15952583_10 (rs2235544), C_15819951_10 (rs225014), C_568127_10 (rs225015), C_7565113_10 (rs945006), C_1710074_20 (rs974453), C_1710122_10 (rs10444412), C_31106584_10 (rs10770704), and C_9579217_10 (rs1515777). All reactions were conducted using the ABI 7900HT real-time PCR Thermo cycle r (Applied Biosystems). Samples were measured in duplicate and nuclease-free water (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was used as the notemplate control.  

# 2.6. Screening for emotional disorders  

Symptoms of anxiety and depression were evaluated using a validated Lithuanian translation of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).   This questionnaire is a self-rated 14 item scale based on 4-point Likert scale dedicated to measure anxiety and depression and composed of 7 items for the depression subscale (HADSD) and 7 items for the anxiety subscale (HADS-A), respectively. Cut-off scores for symptoms of anxiety and depression were selected at  $>7$   points for each of the HADS-A and HADS-D subscales.  

HADS was administered on discharge form the neurology department, usually at the end of the  ﬁ rst week. In case of patient inability to  ﬁ ll the HADS because of paralysis, ataxia or blindness, information was collected directly from the patient by a trained research assistant. Good internal consistency of HADS in both subscales was observed in our study sample (Cronbach's    $\upalpha$   for HADS-D was 0.759 and for HADS-A it was 0.761).  

# 2.7. Statistical analysis  

Normality of the data was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally distributed data is expressed as mean  $\pm$   standard deviation (SD), but for variables with non-normal distribution, as median, 25th  75th percentile (interquartile range). Repeated measurement of hormone levels is expressed as  D FT3,  D FT4 and  D TSH (i.e., the difference between baseline TH level and repeated on discharge). The groups were compared using the Student ’ s t test, MannWhitney ’ s U test, Kruskal-Wallis test or  $\chi^{2}$    test as appropriate. All evaluated SNP were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by  $\chi2$   tests before inclusion in the association statistics (threshold   $\mathrm{~p~}>\ 0.05)$  ). The three genotype groups were compared according to dominant (minor allele homozygous versus wild-type homozygous  $^+$   heterozy- gous), recessive (minor allele homozygous  $^+$   heterozygous versus wild-type homozygous), and additive (minor allele homozygous versus heterozygote versus wild type homozygous) models.   The distributions of minor alleles and of the dominant and recessive genotype models were compared between groups with and without symptoms of anxiety and depression after experienced AIS in univariate regression. The additive genotype model was analysed using the Cochran  Armitage test of trend. In the latter model, dummy variables were produced because model variables have three category levels. Signi ﬁ cant predictors for symptoms of anxiety (age, sex, systolic blood pressure on admission, ISRAD, previous MI, symptoms of depression at discharge, and FT3 serum levels on admission) and for symptoms of depression (NIHSS, FT3 serum levels on admission, BI, ISRAD, age, sex, left carotid territory stroke, and symptoms of anxiety at discharge) were included in the multivariable regression models. Results of univariate and multivariable regression are reported as odds ratio (OR) with   $95\%$   con ﬁ dence intervals (CI). All statistical tests were two-tailed and  $\tt p\,<\,0.05$   was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant. Statistical analyse ’ s were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 23) for Windows.

# 3.1. Patients ’  characteristics  

Study patients   $(n=168)$  ) on discharge from the neurology department at the end of the  ﬁ rst week tended to have a less severe stroke according to NIHSS   $(p<0.001)$  ), were more functionally independent according to BI   $(p<$  0.001), were less frequently to have a left carotid territory stroke   $(p=0.002)$  , treated with intravenous thr ombo lysis  

![](images/57c52a1d688857208c3912711c42bab481daa38894b16fa4c29db0da165f124a.jpg)  

![](images/fd1767517fb0d8d05f6ab410c3275c262f063e7bb506078d38ee1769350d5037.jpg)  

$(p=0.02)$  , were less often sub clinically hyper thyroid

  $(p=0.018)$  , and were more often euthyroid   $(p=0.001)$   in comparison to those who were excluded from the study  $(n=97)$  ).  

The characteristics of all included patients according to HADS-A and HADS-D are reported in  Table 1 . The median age of all patients was 68 (60  74) years, while NIHSS score was 6 (3  11). According to previously suggested criteria,   symptoms of clinically signi ﬁ cant anxiety were expressed in   $19.6\%$     $(n=33)$  ) and symptoms of depression in  $26.2\%$     $(n=44)$   of all included patients.  

No signi ﬁ cant differences in distribution of included baseline characteristics was detected comparing those with and without symptoms of anxiety. Patients with symptoms of depression tended to have a more severe stroke according to NIHSS   $(p\,{=}\,0.002)$  , were more dependent in basic activities of daily living according to BI   $(p<$  0.001), were more likely to have ISRAD   $(p=0.012)$  , had lower FT3 serum levels   $(p=0.012)$  , and lower FT3/FT4 ratio   $(p=0.004)$   compared to those with no symptoms of depression according to HADS-D.  

# 3.2. Association of DIO and the OATP1C1 SNP with emotional disorders screened by the HADS after experienced AIS  

Examined genotypes distribution is presented in Table 2 . All genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium   $(p>0.05)$  . When the minor allele frequency (MAF) was compared between groups, according to the presence of symptoms of anxiety determined by HADS-A, it was found that there was a signi ﬁ cantly more frequent TH transporter OATP1C1-rs1515777 minor allele (A) in patients with symptoms of anxiety ( Table 3 ). MAF distribution was insigni ﬁ cant between groups according to the presence of symptoms of depression.  

A recessive model was applied after adjustment for important con founders (age, sex, systolic blood pressure on admission, ISRAD, previous MI, symptoms of depression at discharge, and FT3 serum levels on admission) which showed that the wild-type DIO1-rs12095080 genotype (AA), compared with at least one minor allele containing the genotype   $(\mathrm{AC}+\mathrm{GC})$  , was associated with higher odds ratio of symptoms of anxiety   $(\mathrm{OR}=5.16)$  ;  $95\%$  CI: 1.04  25.58;  $\mathsf{p}\,{=}\,0.045,$  ), whereas the wild-type DIO1- rs11206244 genotype (CC), compared with at least one minor allele containing the genotype   $(\mathbf{CT}+\mathbf{CC})$   was associated with lower odds ratio of symptoms of anxiety  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.37,$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 0.14  0.96;  $p=0.041$  ) ( Table 4 ). In the dominant model, after adjustment for possible confounders, it was determined that the presence of the wild-type OATP1C1-rs1515777 allele containing the genotypes  $(\mathrm{AA}+\mathrm{AC})$  , compared with the minor allele homozygous genotype (GG), was associated with lower odds ratio of symptoms of anxiety (  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.30)$  ;   $95\%$   CI: 0.12  0.76;  $p\,{=}\,0.011$  ).

Associations were sought between the studied DIO1  3 and the OATP1C1 SNP and symptoms of depression, as determined by HADS-D ( Table 5 ). It was established that in a recessive model after adjustment for important confounders (NIHSS, FT3 serum levels on admission, BI, ISRAD, age, sex, left carotid territory stroke, and symptoms of anxiety at discharge), the wild-type OATP1C1- rs974453 genotype (GG), compared with at least one minor allele-containing genotype   $(\mathrm{GA}+\mathrm{AA}),$  , was associated with higher odds ratio of symptoms of depression  $\mathrm{{OR}}=2.73$  ;  $95\%$   CI: 1.04  7.12;  $p=0.041$  ).  

# 4. Discussion  

The main  ﬁ ndings of this study were determined significant associations between symptoms of anxiety after experienced AIS and DIO1-rs12095080, DIO1-rs11206244 and OATP1C1-rs1515777 SNP. The applied recessive genotype model demonstrated that carrying minor allele of DIO1-rs12095080 was associated with lower odds of anxiety symptoms and, conversely, DIO1-rs11206244 was associated with higher odds of anxiety symptoms, compared with wild type homozygotes. The dominant model showed that minor allele homozygotes of OATP1C1- rs1515777 were associated with higher odds of anxiety symptoms compared to wild type allele carriers. Signi ﬁ - cant associations were also found between symptoms of depression after AIS and OATP1C1-rs974453 SNP. The wild type homozygote of this SNP was associated with higher odds of symptoms of depression compared to minor allele carriers.  

Keeping in mind that thyroid function is associated with emotional dysfunction,   that in TH homeostasis participating factors genetic polymorphisms have an impact on phenotype independently of TH serum levels 43 and importance of TH in stroke recovery,   it is possible that DIO and OATP1C1 SNP make effect on development of symptoms of anxiety and depression after AIS.  

According to the human protein atlas ( https://www. protein atlas.org ) DIO1 is not found in a healthy brain. However, it could reach the brain after AIS during the in ﬂ ammation process 45   with innate immune cells such as neutrophils.   Because in ﬂ ammation is associated with anxiety, while neutrophils participates in stroke repair,   it could be speculated that here DIO1 SNP through intracellular neutrophils TH homeostasis could have a subtle impact on anxiety development after AIS. Moreover, it was found that the construct of DIO1- rs11206244 minor allele (T) and DIO1-rs12095080 wild allele (A) was associated with lower DIO1 activity, because of suggested DIO1 messenger ribonucleic acid stability alterations and / or altered folding, and higher type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) serum levels. Thus, it could be speculated that DIO1 SNP also could act indirectly through IGF-1, which is known for its anxiolytic action.

Multivariable analysis was adjusted to patients’ age, sex, systolic blood pressure on admission, increased social risk for anxiety and depression due to unemployment or retirement before acute ischemic stroke, previous myocardial infarction, symptoms of depression at discharge, and free tr iio do thy ronin e serum levels on admission. AIS, acute ischemic stroke; DIO1, deiodinase 1; DIO2, deiodinase 2; DIO3, deiodinase 3; CI, conﬁdence interval; OATP1C1, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1; OR, odds ratio; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.  

A previously mentioned clinical case of juvenile neurodegeneration shows OATP1C1 transporter importance for brain functioning because of OATP1C1 mutation causing local brain hypo thyroid is m.   Respectively, according to protein atlas, the highest expression of this transporter is within the brain. Additionally in a recent experimental study it was found that an insuf ﬁ ciency of OATP1C1 in zebra ﬁ sh larvae was associated with their behavior alterations.   How established OATP1C1-rs1515777 SNP is associated with symptoms of anxiety and OATP1C1- rs974453 with symptoms of depression after AIS is a matter of speculation. The latter SNP belongs to OATP1C1 intron variants. Intriguingly, the vast majority SNP associated with disease are found in noncoding regions of human genome.   Possibly, these SNP could be associated with impaired function of this transporter or could be just a marker of other functional polymorphisms because of linkage d is equilibrium.  

Converse association according to established minor and wild allele probably re ﬂ ects different natural selection of alleles, which cause a  “ risk ”  to dependents of probable environmental/lifestyle impact.  

# 5. Strengths and limitations  

The main strength of this study is that to the best of our knowledge it is the  ﬁ rst prospective study to examine the relationship between thyroid axis genes SNP and poststroke emotional disturbances using a well validated selfrating test. Another strength is related to participation of three different centres in a study.  

The main study limitations are: 1) moderate sample size which is not large enough to reach suf ﬁ cient power for genetic association study; 2) early screening for depression after stroke could overestimate symptoms of mood impairment because of true depression 53 ; 3) much lost cases because of communication disorder; 4) blood samples were collected within any time of the day with a possibility for TSH and FT3 diurnal variation 54 ; 5) there was no information about pre-stroke mental health and usage of anxiolytic medications or antidepressants; 6) it might be possible, that similar results could be obtained in different study samples such as patients with coronary artery disease,   those suffering from thyroid malfunction 56   or healthy population. For example, similar depression rates as measured by HADS were observed in general population of healthy adults.   However, our study aimed to explore for possible associations to generate new hypothesis that could be used in other studies to con ﬁ rm or refute particular associations that were found in our study sample of patients after AIS. Finally, due to multiple modelling our results should be interpreted with caution and further studies should validate our results. So, it would be worth taking into account mentioned limitations in future studies with larger samples for generalization purposes.

Multivariable analysis was adjusted to patients sex, age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, free tr iio do thy ronin e serum levels on admission, Barthel Index, increased social risk for anxiety and depression due to unemployment or retirement before acute ischemic stroke, left carotid territory stroke and symptoms of anxiety at discharge. AIS, acute ischemic stroke; DIO1, deiodinase 1; DIO2, deiodinase 2; DIO3, deiodinase 3; CI, conﬁdence interval; OATP1C1, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1; OR, odds ratio; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.  

# 6. Conclusions  

In spite of the aforementioned limitations, our  ﬁ ndings showed that DIO1-rs12095080 major allele was associated with increased probability of post-stroke anxiety but major allele of DIO1-rs11206244 and OATP1C1-rs1515777 were associated with decreased probability for symptoms of anxiety. Major allele of OATP1C1-rs974453 was associated with higher probability of symptoms of anxiety.
