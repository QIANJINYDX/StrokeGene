Abstract . In ischemic stroke, extra cranial MR angiography (ECMRA) is more frequently abnormal in Caucasians and intra cranial (ICMRA) in Asians which may have a genetic basis. We report ph os ph odi est erase (PDE4D) gene polymorphism and its correlation with MRA ﬁndings in patients with ischemic stroke.  

Consecutive patients with MRI proven ischemic stroke undergoing MRA were included in this study. The severity of atherosclerotic stenosis on MRA was categorized into moderate  $50\%–80\%$  , severe   $80\%–99\%$  , and total occlusion  $100\%$   using NASCET criteria. The polymorphism in SNP 32, SNP 83 and SNP 87 of PDE4D gene was analyzed by PCR both in the patients and in 188 controls.  

Among the 148 patients, MRA was abnormal in  $77\%$   patients; ECMRA in  $53.8\%$  , ICMRA in  $66\%$   and both were abnormal in  $42\%$   patients. The frequency of CC genotype of PDE4D83 was sign i cant ly higher in the patients with ischemic stroke compared to controls (OR 3.38,  $95\%$   CI 1.61–7.11,  $P=0.001$  ). The frequency of TT genotype of PDE4D87 was sign i cant ly higher ICMRA abnormalities   $(20\%)$   compared to normal ICMRA  $(2\%)$  ). The genotype and allele frequency of PDE4D83 and PDE4D32 were not sign i cant ly related to MRA abnormalities. The role of PDE4D87 in atherosclerosis needs con rm ation in larger studies.

# 1. Introduction  

Ischemic stroke is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the world and constitutes   $80\%$   of all strokes. It is mostly due to atherosclerosis of extracranial (carotid or vert ebro basil ar) or intra cranial arteries. The distribution of carotid atherosclerosis has a racial and/or geographical trend, which has been conﬁrmed in autopsy and ang io graphic studies. In Caucasians, extra cranial atherosclerosis accounts for the majority of cases whereas in Asians and blacks, intracranial atherosclerosis is commoner [1–3]. In a study on MR angiography (MRA), extra cranial abnormality was present in  $56.3\%$   and intra cranial in  $63.3\%$   highlighting the distribution of atherosclerosis in Indians is midway between Asians and Caucasians [4]. Diabetes is more commonly associated with intra cranial atherosclerosis whereas hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease with extra cranial atherosclerosis [5–7].  

Ph os ph odi est erase (PDE4D) genotype has been reported to be associated with ischemic stroke, carotid atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease [8–10]. The carotid atherosclerosis in these studies was evaluated on the basis of Doppler sonography in normal population. The action of PDE4D is poorly understood though these enzymes have been reported to involve in systematic degradation of messenger cyclic AMP and has a key role in signal transduction and regulation of physiological responses. In the vascular wall, low cyclic AMP leads to in amma tion, proliferation and migration of smooth muscles which may contribute to the atherosclerosis and occurrence of stroke. Hydrolysis of cAMP is mediated partly by PDE4D which may in turn results in atherosclerosis [11]. The distribution of atherosclerosis (in tr cranial or extra cranial) may have a genetic basis but the role of at hero scl erosis related genes have not been studied in this context. MR angiography provides a non invasive and objective method for documenting intra cranial and extracranial atherosclerosis. In the present study, we report for the ﬁrst time the PDE4D gene polymorphism in patients with ischemic stroke and correlate with MR ang io graphic ﬁndings.  

# 2. Subjects and methods  

MRI proven ischemic stroke patients attending the neurology service of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences were included. For the assessment of stroke subtypes, the class i cation of the trial of ORG 10172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) investigators was used [12]. The patients with cardioembolic and arterial dissection related stroke were excluded. The study was duly approved by Institute Ethics Committee. Informed consent was taken from all the patients or their ﬁrst degree relatives and healthy controls who were included in the study. The demographic and personal history included age, gender, area of residence, ethnicity, dietary habits, life style, smoking (current tobacco smoker or till 1 year back), and alcohol intake   $(>100\;\mathrm{ml/day})$  ). The clinical risk factors of stroke include systemic hypertension (  $\mathrm{SBP}\geqslant$   $140\;\mathrm{mm\;Hg}$   and   $\mathrm{DBP}\geqslant90\;\mathrm{mm}\;\mathrm{Hg}$  , history of hypertension or on anti hypertensive drugs), diabetes (fasting blood sugar  $\geqslant106\,\mathrm{mg/d l}$  ,  $_{2\,\mathrm{h}}$   post prandial blood sugar  $\geqslant200\;\mathrm{mg/dl}$   or on oral hypoglycemic drug or insulin therapy), dys lipid emi a (abnormal lipid proﬁle, history of statin therapy, coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease) [13], history of stroke in the ﬁrst degree relatives and past history of stroke were noted. The patients with cardio embolic stroke, arterial dissection, a or to art er it is, Moyamoya disease, liver and kidney failure, thyroid disorder and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis were excluded.  

# 2.1. Investigations  

Blood counts, hemoglobin, serum chemistry including fasting lipid proﬁle were carried out in all the patients. Radiograph of chest and electrocardiogram were done.  

MR angiography: The MR studies were carried out within 1 week of admission on a   $1.5\mathrm{~T~}$   MR scanner (Signa echospeed plus, Milwaukee, US) with a quadrature head coil for the intra cranial MR angiography (MRA) and NV array or spinal array coil for the extracranial MR angiography in the region of the neck. The sequences used were multislab (3 slab for intracranial and 6 slab for extra cranial regions) 3D SPGR sequences based on time of ﬂight principle. The repetition time, echo time and FLIP angle were  $26~\mathrm{{ms}}$  ,  $6.9\,\mathrm{ms}$   and 20 degrees respectively for these sequences. MRAs were reviewed by a neuro radiologist (S.K) who was blinded to the clinical data. Stenotic abnormalities were assessed systematically on both extra cranial (EC) and intra cranial (IC) MRA including carotid and vertebral arteries. Any narrowing in vessel diameter of  $50\%$   or more was regarded as signiﬁcant stenosis on both EC and IC MRA. The measurement of stenosis was computed directly on maximum intensity projection view of MRA. The collapse view of the propcher was also taken into measurement in the evaluation of MRA. Collapse view was also taken for evaluation of stenosis. Percent stenosis was computed by measuring the residual lumen diameter comparing it with normal segment above or below (NASCET) [14]. The ves- sel in which signal void was regained distal to occlusion was considered patent and deﬁned as   $80\%–99\%$  stenosis. The results were categorized as clinically insigniﬁcant if the stenosis on MRA was    $<50\%$  , and clinically signiﬁcant if the at hero sclerotic stenosis was  $\geqslant50\%$  ; moderate  $50–80\%$  , severe  $80–99\%$  , and total occlusion  $100\%$  . Carotid siphon stenosis was not included because of possibility of artifacts arising from anterior clinoid process, sphenoid sinus and intra voxel dephasing.  

# 2.2. Genetic studies  

$5~\mathrm{\milde{l}}$   of venous blood was collected in EDTA tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted using salting out method [15]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in a standardized way using the primers for the speciﬁc regions containing these SNPs (32, 83 and 87) as described previously [16]. These SNPs were selected due to its relationship with ischemic stroke [17].  

Aliquots of   $5~\mu\mathrm{L}$   PCR product were subjected to restriction end on ucl ease digestion for genotyping using the restriction enzymes. The polymorphism in SNP 32, SNP 83 and SNP 87 was detected by digesting the PCR product with restriction enzymes MSPA1I (New England Biolabs), TaiI fast digest (New England Biolabs) and SSP1 (New England Biolabs) respectively. The digested bands were visualized on   $10\%$   polya cry l amide gel electro ph ores ed for 5 hours at   $200\;\mathrm{V}.$   Positive and negative controls were included on each run.  

# 2.3. Statistical analysis  

We have included 148 patients and 188 controls belonging to the same geographic and ethnic group. Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was ﬁrst tested for PDE4D gene in healthy controls and was found to be  $\textsl{p}>0.05$  . Clinical variables were compared between patients with and without MRA abnormality using chi square tests for categorical variables. All the statistical tests were two sided, and were considered signiﬁcant if the two tailed  $p$   value was  $<0.05$  . Chi square test was applied for the analysis of genotypic and allelic distribution. Association of each studied polymorphism with ischemic stroke was assessed by the logistic regression using odds ratio (OR) with  $95\%$  conﬁdence interval (CI) after adjusting for confounding variables including age and gender when compared with the controls. Bonferroni correction was done for multiple comparisons. 3 patients in PDE4D 83, and 2 patients in PDE4D32 were excluded in logistic regression analysis due to genotyping d if cul ties leaving a total of 145 and 146 cases respectively.  

# 3. Results  

148 patients with ischemic stroke were included whose median age was 61 (21–85) years and 40   $(27\%)$  were females. 80   $(54.1\%)$   patients were vegetarians, 39   $(26.4\%)$   were tobacco smokers, 23   $(15.5\%)$   took alcohol and 44   $(29.7\%)$   chewed tobacco. 111   $(75\%)$  patients were hypertensive, 50   $(33.8\%)$   were diabetic, 44   $(30\%)$   had high LDL, 15   $(10.2\%)$   had hypercholes te role mia, 52   $(35.3\%)$   had hyper triglyceride mia and 68   $(59.6\%)$  had hyper homo cy steinem i a. More than 2 risk factors were present in 74   $(50\%)$   patients and family history of stroke in the ﬁrst degree relatives was present in 35   $(23.6\%)$   patients.  

Stroke was located in middle cerebral arterial territory in 82   $(55.4\%)$  , anterior cerebral artery in 1   $(0.7\%)$  , posterior cerebral in 31   $(20.9\%)$  , vert ebro basil ar arteri- al territory in 19   $(12.8\%)$   and the remaining 15   $(10.2\%)$  patients had multiple territory infarction s. Cortical infarction (large vessel disease) was present in 48   $(32.4\%)$  , sub cortical (small vessel) in 42   $(28.3\%)$  and remaining had both cortical and sub cortical infarctions.  

# 3.1. MRA  

MRA was carried out in 148 patients; extra cranial MRA was carried out in 130, intra cranial in 144 and both in 126 patients. MRA abnormalities were extracranial in 70   $(53.8\%)$  , intra cranial in 95   $(66\%)$  , both in 53   $(42\%)$   and any MRA (ICMRA/ECMRA/both) was abnormal in 114   $(77\%)$   patients. The extra cranial abnormalities were present in common carotid artery (CCA) in 3, internal carotid artery (ICA) in 42 and vertebral artery in 6,  $\mathrm{CCA+ICA}$   in 17 and both carotid and vertebral arteries in 2 patients. Total occlusion was present in 13, severe stenosis in 9, moderate stenosis in 18 and mild stenosis in 30 patients. The locations of intra cranial MRA abnormality were in internal carotid artery in 43, middle cerebral artery in 51, anterior cerebral artery in 21, posterior cerebral in 31, basilar artery in 14 and vertebral artery in 11 patients. Evaluation of various risk factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, fami- ly history of stroke, smoking, alcohol, tobacco, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, homo c ystein and number of risk factors with extra cranial, intra cranial and combined MRA abnormalities revealed signiﬁcant association of family history of stroke with intra cranial MRA abnormality   $P=0.007)$  ) and number of risk factors   $(>2)$   with extra cranial MRA abnormalities (  $P=$  0.01). 29 out of 95   $(30.5\%)$   patients with family history of stroke had ICMRA abnormality whereas only 5 out of 49   $(10.2\%)$   without family history of stroke had ICMRA abnormality. The remaining variables were not associated with MRA abnormalities (Table 1).  

# 3.2. Genetic association study:  

The frequency of CC genotypeof PDE4D83 was signiﬁcantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke compared to controls (OR 3.38,   $95\%$   CI 1.61–7.11,    $P\,=$  0.001). The frequency of TT genotype of PDE4D87

 (OR 1.28,  $95\%\mathrm{CI}\,0.56{-}2.91$  ,  $P=0.35)$  ) and AA genotype of PDE4D32 (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.32–1.57,  $P=$  0.36) however did not differ between patients and controls. None of the allele frequency of PDE4D in stroke

was sign i cant ly different from controls (Table 2). Comparing the MRA abnormalities with those with normal MRA revealed sign i cant ly higher frequency of TT genotype of PDE4D87 in patients with ICMRA abnormalities. The frequency of TT genotype was  $20\%$   in patients with abnormal ICMRA but it was only  $2\%$   in those with normal ICMRA. After adjustment for age, gender, smoking, alcohol, tobacco, cholesterol, LDL, family history of stroke, hypertension and diabetes PDE4D87 however was not sign i cant ly related to any form of MRA abnormality. The genotype and allele frequency of PDE4D83 and PDE4D32 were also not sign i cant ly associated with any form of MRA abnormalities. The details are summarized in Table 3.  

# 4. Discussion  

In our study PDE4D83 polymorphism was significantly associated with ischemic stroke compared to controls and the frequency of TT genotype of P DE 4 D 87 was sign i cant ly higherin patients with ICMRA abnor

malities compared to those with normal ICMRA. After adjustment for other risk factors of stroke, none of the PDE4D genotype and allele was however sign i cant ly associated with ICMRA, ECMRA or any MRA abnormalities. Our results are in agreement with Asian and Icelandic study in which no association of PDE4D83 gene was found with ischemic stroke [16–18]. In a study from USA, PDE4D87 was associated with cardioembolic stroke both in whites and blacks [8]; however, other studies have not found any association of PDE4D87 [19–21]. In the present study, we have excluded card i oem boli c stroke and stroke due to arterial dissection. Different studies evaluating PDE4D32 in different populations also revealed no association with ischemic stroke [16,22,23]. In a study from south India, SNP 83 was found to be sign i cant ly associated with the intra cranial large artery atherosclerosis and small artery occlusion [24]. Staton et al. have found a positive association of SNP 83 with ischemic stroke in an Australian population [25].  

In our study, the frequency of TT genotype of PDE4D87 was sign i cant ly higher in ICMRA abnormalities compared to those patients with normal ICMRA but its sign i can ce was lost after adjustment of confounding variables such as hypertension, diabetes, age, smoking, hyper lipid emi a and family history of stroke. This lack of association on PDE4D polymorphism with atherosclerosis after adjustment of other stroke risk factors may be due to multi factorial nature of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis and stroke are interlinked and both are inﬂuenced by various non modi able and modiﬁable risk factors. PDE4D83 and PDE4D32 were not sign i cant ly associated with increased risk of ICMRA, ECMRA or any MRA abnormalities.  

Although many studies on PDE4D gene focused on replicating the Icelandic ﬁndings but the results are inconsistent. The lack of association may be due to relatively small sample size which might have missed true association of modest effect. Moreover PDE4D is a very large gene spanning greater than  $1.5\,\mathrm{Mb}$   with several hundreds of SNPs which may also account for variation in the results. We have selected SNPs 32, 83 and 87 of PDE4D gene based on the report of Greta rs do ttir et al. in which these SNPs are shown to have maximum risk of ischemic stroke [17]. The other possible reason for discordant results may be due to difference in allele frequency and haplotypes in different ethnic populations which reﬂect different patterns of linkage disequilibrium for non causal markers. The role of PDE4D is still unclear even though it has been associated with stroke in certain populations. These genes are postulated to involve in the signaling pathway of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. Cyclic GMP regulates the level of these ph os ph odi est erases which in turn links with NO production by vascular endothelium [26]. This is important because the NO-cGMP pathway is believed to be dysfunctional in stroke [27]. There are reports that the ph os ph odi est erase 4 inhibitor activity was greatly reduced if cGMP synthesis was inhibited. Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors have been reported useful in the prevention of ischemic stroke [26,27]. The analysis of PDE4D83 in our ischemic stroke patients with and without MRA abnormality did not reveal any signiﬁ- cant difference. However the frequency of TT genotype of PDE4D87 was sign i cant ly higher in patients with intra cranial atherosclerosis compared to normal ICMRA. Presence of more than 2 risk factors in our patients was associated with ECMRA abnormality and family history of stroke in ﬁrst degree relative with ICMRA abnormality.  

The results of this study suggest signiﬁcant association of  PDE4D83  with ischemic stroke compared to controls as well as sign i cant ly higher frequency of TT genotype of PDE4D87 in patients with ICMRA abnormality compared to those with normal ICMRA but its sign i can ce was lost after adjustment of other stroke risk factors. This may be due to multi factorial nature of stoke.
