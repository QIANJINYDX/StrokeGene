Cerebro vascular accidents (CVAs) are vascular multi factorial, multigenic ailments with intricate genetic, environmental risk in ﬂ uences. The present study aimed to establish af ﬁ liation of CVAs/stroke with blood parameters, differences in prescribed drugs consumption, and with differences in homo cyst eine pathway genes polymorphisms. The participants in study included controls  $n\!=\!251$  , transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients  $n=16$  , and stroke cases  $n\!=\!122$  , respectively, (total participants,  $n\!=\!389$  ). The analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) included C677T(rs1801133), A1298C(rs1801131) of methylene tetra hydro folate reductase ( MTHFR ), A2756G(rs1805087) of methyl tetrahydrofolate homo cyst eine methyl transfer as e/methionine synthase ( MS ), and the A192G (rs662) of para oxon as e 1( PON1 ) genes, all validated by tetra-primer allele refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (T-ARMS-PCR). The insertion deletion (I/D; rs4646994) polymorphism in angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) gene was analyzed using routine PCR. All studied traits were scrutinized through analysis of variance (ANOVA), and later through regression analysis. Through ANOVA and multiple comparison, there was association of CV A with serum homo cyst eine, cholesterol,and with diastolic blood pressure readings. When data was subjected to regression, serum homo cyst eine and diastolic blood pressure (signi ﬁ cant through ANOVA), as well as two additional traits, high-density lipoprotein s (HDL), and rs1801133 MTHFR SNP sustained statistical signi ﬁ cance and noteworthy odds in relation to CVA and stroke. The ailments affecting cerebral vas cula ture are muti factorial, whereby genes, proteins, and environmental cues all exert cumulative effects enhancing CVA risk. The current study emphasizes that SNPs and variation in circulating biomarkers can be used for screening purposes and for reviewing their effects in stroke/CVA-linked risk progression.  

# Introduction  

Stroke/cerebro vascular accidents (CVAs) are common in both the developed nations as well as developing nations and pose a raised national and international socioeconomic burden. Stroke represents weakness/loss of power in extremities, secondary to abnormal brain tissue perfusion, which in turn is subsequent to ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebral vessels. Ischemic stroke (following thrombosis or infarction) is much more common than the hemorrhagic cerebral disease, comprising more than fourﬁ fths of the cases, with males affected more than females.   The prevalence of stroke numbers in millions and a great majority of affected patients suffer from lifelong debility, incapacity, and even fatal outcomes. Trivial stroke symptoms and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are additionally associated with higher risk of stroke as well as higher riskof inabilities.   Stroke-related death was around  ﬁ ve million in 2006 and is expected to rise by nearly another three million within 10 years.   The slight decline in CVAs detected in developed nations is concomitant with augmented cases in developing nations, however, the occurrence of disease, surviving patients, and even fatalities are continuously showing a rising trend.   In Pakistan, there are four million stroke cases, with the rate of CVA/stroke being  ﬁ ve to 10 times higher as compared with United Kingdom or United States.   The number of stroke af ﬂ icted persons, in Pakistan, was around 80 of every 0.1 million individuals in year 2010, and number will greatly increase in the coming years.  

The risk factors associated with stroke/CVA include conventionally assigned ones such as old age, male sex, hyper c holesterolemia, hypertension, smoking, cardiovascular diseases, coa gulo p athies, as well as advanced  “ newly recognized ” ones such as genetic polymorphisms, mRNA variants, elevated – 10 homo cyst eine,  ﬁ brinogen levels, and CRP among others. There is strong predisposition of male gender, increasing age, higher blood pressure, smoking and less optimal physical activity with advanced odds of stroke.   The genetic polymorph isms and hyper homo cy steinem i a are newly ident i ﬁ edstroke risk predictors, the polymorphisms being independently associated with stroke.   Methylene tetra hydro folate reductase ( MTHFR ) gene is related to high homo cyst eine levels, vascular disease, and stroke. The two signi ﬁ cant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in  MTHFR  gene, C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) are also strongly associated with risk of CVA/Stroke, with some studies exhibiting one SNP in favor of – 13 theother. The rs 1805087 SNP in methionine synthase( MS ) gene although is related to thr ombo embo li c phenomenon still itdoes not exhibit relation to stroke.   The stroke/CVA is high in patients with rs662 PON1 SNP and rs4646994 ACE SNP.  

The medications used in hypertensive patients have disparate results in outcomes, with some drug regimens showing bene ﬁ cial and others no role in stroke prevention. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)inhibitors and  $\upbeta$   blockers either alone or in combination gives dissimilar results in end point occurrence of stroke and/or fatal outcomes. Strokein hypertensive patients developed despite using the forementioned anti hypertensive medications, possible due to less optimal dosage or compliance to therapy.   Statin usage and low dose aspirin administration (more advantage in combination therapy) is additionally associated with lower risk of cerebral vascular disease outcomes.   Some studies report that prescription/use of diuretics, calcium channel blockers shows a declining trend in hypertension management, while others showan increased trend. Diuretics and calcium channel blockers (parallel to previously stated anti hypertensive medication) reduced the risk of cardiovascular events and stroke in hypertensive patients.   The aim of the present study is to elucidate the role of serum-related traits, genetic polymorphisms and differences in anti hypertensive medication as they relate to stroke/CVA.  

# Subjects, Materials, and Methods  

# Study Characteristics  

The approval for the current study was obtained from Ethical Committee/Institutional Review Committee of the Combined Military Hospital Medical College,Kharian. All the participants in study provided written informed consent for the facts/information and use of samples. The samples of controls, TIA, and stroke cases were acquired from Rawalpindi district headquarter hospital (DHQ hospital), Rawalpindi General/ Benazir Bhutto Hospital, and Islamabad Polyclinic Hospital, Islamabad, respectively. Patients with renal diseases, heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), and coa gulo p athies were excluded.  

All participants in study, whether controls, TIA cases, and those with stroke were diagnosed hypertensive s, on prescription (with patchy drug compliance history, more so in cases). The TIA and CVA cases presented in ER within 2 to 5 hours of onset of symptoms, major fraction of the patients presenting in the early morning hours. Patients with TIA develop symptoms for limited duration, are at an increased risk of developing complete stroke, and hence require distinct attention. The presenting features for the majority of cases included severe headache and inability to stand up or sit on getting up after sleep, and in some cases fall while getting up or walking. There was accompanying inability to talk or to move the limbs, with feeling of numbness, dizziness, and in coordination. The physical examination revealed altered consciousness, sensory, and motor de ﬁ cits in one half of the body with loss of power and inability to move affected limbs on command. Imaging analysis  “ the computed tomography ”  (CT scanning) was performed for all the TIA and CVA cases to con ﬁ rm the site, localization, type, and extent of CNS damage. The repeat CT scans were performed for stroke patients in which earlier scans were non remarkable. In patients with suspected cardiac anomalies or suspected coagulation disorders, blood tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) or echo car dio graph y was performed and patients with renal disease, coa gulo p athies, heart failure, and  ﬁ brillation were excluded from the study. The patients who exhibited marked improvement and recovery within a day of presentation and no  ﬁ ndings on CTscan were labeled as TIA patients, and those who exhibited no physical recovery in their CNS symptoms and signs, and with positive  ﬁ ndings on CT scan (for hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke) were labeled as cases for the current study. All participants, whether controls or cases, were hypertensive, mostly overweight, and exhibited sedentary life styles.  

# Investigation of Clinical and Body Fluid/Biochemical Factors  

Clinical assessment, (performed on presentation and during blood sampling), included general physical checkup, cardiac and neurological status valuation, blood pressure estimation (systolic SBP/diastolic DBP), temperature   $(^{\circ}\mathsf{C})$  , and electrocardiogram (ECG) to check for possible cardiac abnormalities as possible cause of stroke. Blood sampling was performed at daybreak, serum was extracted (stored at  $-20^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   till analysis), and the factors checked included: lipid pro ﬁ ling analysis for the total cholesterol, total triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein evaluation   $({\mathrm{mg/dL}})$  ; homo cyst eine   $(\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L})$  ; and creatinine, blood sugar   $({\mathrm{mg/dL}})$   estimation. Enzyme-linked immuno s or bent analysis  “ ELISA ”  assay by the EIA kit (DRG International Inc., United States) provided foundation for homo cyst eine estimation, whereas remaining serum factors were analyzed by commercial AMP kits by  “ AMEDA Diagnostic ”  (GmbH, Germany). The participant data regarding drug intake was recorded by questionnaires, and the query about the usage and compliance for the class of drug being used, including the statins, aspirin, calcium channel antagonists,  $\upbeta$  antagonists, ACE antagonists, and diuretics was designated.  

For SNP analysis, 5 to  $7\,\mathrm{mL}$   of venous blood was collected in EDTA tubes, DNA extracted (from peripheral blood leukocytes), by routine method and stored at  $4^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  . The genomic sequences for studied SNPs: rs1801133 and rs1801131 ( MTHFR  gene); rs662 ( PON1  gene); rs1805087 ( MTR / MS ) gene; and 4s4646994 ( ACE  gene) were queried through UCSC genome browser database at http://genome.ucsc.- edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway and primers were inquired through http://cedar.genetics.soton.ac.uk. The primers were optimized for obtaining appropriate and adequately ampli ﬁ ed bands. Tetra-primer allele-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction ARMS-PCR was performed, using 25-µL master mix, for all the studied SNPs and thermal cycler used for sequence ampli ﬁ cation was Biometra T1 (GmbH, Germany). A random group of samples was subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for authentication of genotype as attained through tetra-primer ARMS-PCR analysis. The primer sequences used, the reaction mixture details, the steps of genotyping techniques have been stated elsewhere.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Prior to analysis, the levels of homo cyst eine were converted to log values, and these log values were used, as the original values were signi ﬁ cantly askew (established through R “ nortest ” ). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and multiple comparison testing  “ post hoc ”  was performed using IBM SPSS v25 (IBM Corp. release 2017). ANOVA and post hoc scrutiny were computed for age, gender, lipid pro ﬁ le, homocysteine, blood sugar, blood pressure, drugs administered, and the related SNPs in the study; signi ﬁ cant value was assigned for  $p$   values  $<0.05$  . For post hoc analysis, we used the  “ Tamhane test ”  as this test gives values for variables assuming unequal variance in the data. Succeeding the ANOVA investigation was the regression scrutiny of the data through R 4.0.2 statistics package (R Core Team, 2020, Vienna, Austria). The data was analyzed for statistical significance, odds ratio, and  $95\%$   con ﬁ dence intervals. All the traits examined through the ANOVA were analyzed through the regression investigation. The signi ﬁ cance was again given to  $p$  -value  $<0.05$  . As is the case with data in tables, the plots and graphs in the  ﬁ gures were also obtained through use of both the statistical packages. Both tests were performed for added sc rut in iz ation and authentication of the data.

# Descriptive/Demographic Data  

The participant demographic data and biochemical variables, comparing the three test groups, are summarized in  ► Table 1 . The number of males in controls   $(n\!=\!251)$  ) was 198   $(78.9\%)$  , in TIA patients   $(n=16)$  ) was 13   $(81.2\%)$  , and in CVA/stroke cases   $'n=122.$  ) was 94 (  $\cdot(77\%)$  ; the mean age   $(\pm\,\mathsf{S D})$   was 65.2 years (8.09), 64.19 years (4.43), and 65.28 years (7.9) in the three fore mentioned groups, respectively. The mean values   $(\pm\mathsf{S}\mathsf{D})$   of total cholesterol and creatinine in the controls were   $195.68\,\mathrm{mg/DL}$   (42.94) and 1.006 mg/dL (0.42); in the TIA patients   $190.84\,\mathrm{mg/dL}\,(3$  6.07) and  $0.975\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$   (0.27); and in the stroke cases was 206.66 mg/dL (37.11) and   $1.001\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$   (0.36), respectively. Fasting blood sugar levels, HDL, and triglyceride levels   $(\pm\,\mathsf{S D})$   in controls, TIA patients and CVA cases were   $109.91\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$  (42.85),   $115.84\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$   (26.79),   $118.72\,\mathrm{mg/DL}$   (54.81); 53.36 mg/dL (15.72),   $50.75\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$   (14.72),   $56.03\,\mathrm{mg/dL}$   (21.15); and   $137.06\,\mathrm{mg/DL}$   (85.14),   $134.44\,\mathrm{mg/DL}$   (15.95), 152.84 mg/dL (69.09), respectively. The systolic blood pressure

  $(\pm\,\mathsf{S D})$   reading was 135.76 mm Hg (17.37),   $133.88\,\mathrm{mm~Hg}$  (9.27), and   $137.87\,\mathrm{mm}\ \mathrm{Hg}$   (21.43), whereby the diastolic blood pressure reading was 77.58 mm Hg (10.94),  $78.25\,\mathrm{mm}$   $\mathrm{Hg}\,(5.08)$  , and   $80.99\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{Hg}\,(12.59)$  , respectively in the three studied groups. Finally, the log homo cyst eine levels in the controls was   $1.12\,\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}\,(0.12),$  , in TIA patients ’  levels for log homo cyst eine were   $1.08~\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$  cases levels were   $1.15\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$   (0.14).  

# Analysis of Variance and Multiple Comparison  

All the variables/factors were analyzed through ANOVA and post hoc analysis, latter equation utilizing Tamhane test sighting unequal variance of data. Homo cyst eine levels had overall signi ﬁ cance  $p\!=\!0.008$  , and there was post hoc analysis documented signi ﬁ cance in control versus TIA patients at  $p\!=\!0.038$   and between controls and CVA/stroke cases at  $p\!=\!0.042$  . Total cholesterol levels also achieved statistical signi ﬁ cancewith  $p\!=\!0.04$   and post hoc analysis was sign i ﬁ cant in control versus stroke cases with    $p\!=\!0.035$  . Finally, the diastolic blood pressure maintained signi ﬁ cance at  $p\!=\!0.025$  with subsequent measured signi ﬁ cant difference in controls compared with stroke cases at    $p\!=\!0.034$  . Neither the differential drug usage nor the differential genotypes in the controls, TIA patients, and cases could achieve statistical valuation

# Regression Analysis  

Post ANOVA, regression analysis gave different results, the cholesterol levels lost signi ﬁ cance whereas other three constants, that were not signi ﬁ cant in ANOVA, gained regression analysis-mediated signi ﬁ cant result. Two of the three coefﬁ cients, although achieved statistical signi ﬁ cance, yet had nonsigni ﬁ cant odds ratio as well as nonsigni ﬁ cant   $95\%$  con ﬁ dence intervals, explicitly, serum creatinine level  $p\!=\!0.038$  ,  ${\tt O R}\!=\!0.732$  ,  $95\%$     ${\mathsf{C I}}\,{=}\,0.546$   to 0.983, and systolic blood pressure  $p\,{=}\,0.030,0{\mathsf{R}}\,{=}\,0.992,95\%\,{\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{I}}\,{=}\,0.985\,{\mathrm{t}}$   0.999. The robust association of homo cyst eine with stroke remained vigorous following regression scrutiny as well with  $p\!=\!0.019$  ,  $\mathrm{0R}\,{=}\,3.075$  ,  $95\%~{\mathsf{C I}}=1.203$   to 7.859, respectively. The diastolic blood pressure also retained signi ﬁ cance,  $p\!=\!0.001$  ,   $\mathrm{0R}\,{=}\,1.02$  ,   $95\%$     ${\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{I}}=1.008$   to 1.033. The third coef ﬁ cient, nonsigni ﬁ cant following ANOVA, yet signi ﬁ cant through regression analysis was rs1801133 MTHFR SNP; the  $p$  -value  $=\!0.043$  ,   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.189$  , and   $95\%~{\mathsf{C I}}=1.010$   to 1.406, respectively. The results of the regression analysis for all the studied variables in the study are charted in the  ► Table 3 .

# Discussion  

Stroke is amongst the leading causes of fatalities and disabilities resulting from vascular defects. There is scarcity of studies aimed at elucidation of genetic variants and variances in medication intake as related to causation/risk strati ﬁ cation of strokes, CVAs. Current study worked on interaction of novel genetic variants, serum-based factors, and traditional vascular disease risk in ﬂ uences, that may ultimately manifest as stroke. We undertook tetra-primer ARMS-PCR to resolve the allelic differences,ELISA for homo cy steinem i a estimation, traditional kits for detecting the blood factors, and we did formal analysis through ANOVA and linear regression for detection of robust traits that associate with stroke. Hyper homo cy steinem i a, differences in diastolic blood pressure readings, and MTHFR SNP rs1801133 were the main contenders that strongly related with risk of stroke/CVAs in our study.  

Stroke is a debilitating disease that results in severe disability and poses a very high social and economic burden.   The traditional risk predictors associated with stroke include dys lipid emi a, old age, male gender, smoking status, obesity/ high fat diet, and arterial calci ﬁ cation of vessels supplying the central nervous system.   Hypercholesterolemia and hyper triglyceride mia are associated with vascular diseases and elevated stroke incidence, whereas HDL and LDL have displayed limited association with vascular diseases and resultant cerebral diseases outcomes.   In the current study, although initial analysis demonstrated that cholesterol levels had association with stroke  $(p\!=\!0.04)$  and there was sign i ﬁ cant difference in controls related to CVA cases   $(p\!=\!0.035)$  ), yet the regression analysis failed to maintain this signi ﬁ cance. Serum triglyceride level was also not related to disease risk, yet HDL related to stroke risk following regression analysis. Renal disease and higher value of blood creatinine are additional in ﬂ uences on vascular com or bidi ties, are stroke predictors, and may result in fatal outcomes ; however, creatinine did not maintain signi ﬁ cance to stroke in present study.  

Individuals with high blood pressure take various categories of medicines to limit their elevated blood pressure, to decrease risk of atherosclerosis, calci ﬁ cation, and to limit the additional cardiac load. There are several anti hypertensive and cardiovascular risk lowering agents available, and their

prescription is dependent on individual physician/patient interactions and preferences. The drugs available include lipid lowering agents (statins), blood thinners (aspirin),    $\upbeta$  receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers/inhibitors (ARB/ARI)/ACE inhibitors, and diuretics, to name a few. The use of statins and aspirin, although not strictly anti hypertensive agents, are related to depressed risk of postoperative and hypertension-mediated CVAs.   The use of    $\upbeta$   antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, and ACE inhibitors/ARI carry disparate results, with some studies displaying bene ﬁ t and others no bene ﬁ t (or high risk) in stroke prevention or adverse out– 31   comes. The diuretics are the mainstay of treatment in heart failure and are used as prophylaxis management Table 3  The relationship of studied traits with stroke based on regression analysis (with associated odds ratio, con ﬁ dence intervals)

regimen for stroke. An added list of literature cites use of diuretics in hypertensive patients and favorable outcomes – 31   regarding cardiac and cerebral events. We studied the drug usage of all the mentioned classes of drugs and results indicate no differential drug regimen amongst the controls, TIA, and cerebral vascular disease patients.  

Hypertension is harbinger of vascular diseases and stroke, with elevated readings resulting in serious complications. Elevated systolic blood pressure and elevated diastolic blood pressure readings are associated with vascular disease and various cardiovascular-related end points.   There are differences in outcomes and adverse effects depending on elevated levels of either of the two, SBP or DBP.   Studies demonstrate limited risk of heart failure, CAD, stroke, and fatal outcomes, with different readings for systolic blood pressure, and likewise different readings of diastolic blood pressure.   Previous studies, therefore, provide independent signi ﬁ cance to either of the

two blood pressure readings, whether SBP or DBP. The diastolic blood pressure reading was a signi ﬁ cant factor for stroke risk in current study,as it showed sign i ﬁ can ce with stroke after A NOVA  $(p\!=\!0.025)$  and also sign i ﬁ cance(through multiple comparison) in control as compared with cases, yet the SBP was nonsigni ﬁ - cant. The regression analysis displayed limited odds when comparing relation of stroke with SBP but signi ﬁ cant odds of stroke as a result of D BP levels,and this observation is consistent with previous studies. Homo cyst eine, a novel risk factor is strongly associated with CAD and stroke, with elevated levels of stroke associated with stroke risk in young.   Hyperhomocy steinem i a was associated with stroke in current study as well  $(p\!=\!0.008)$  ) with signi ﬁ cant difference when controls were compared with TIA, or with CVA cases. The odds of stroke were highly signi ﬁ cant in hypertensive patients, following regression analysis.   $(p\!=\!0.019$  ,   $\Omega\!\!{\mathrm{R}}\!=\!3.075$  ). The SNPs in folate pathway genes, rs1801133 and rs1801131 of the  MTHFR gene, rs1805087 in MS, rs662 of PON1, and ACE gene (not in folate pathway)rs 4646994 SNP have dissimilar association with – 14   stroke, as per literature. The most extensively studied SNP in relation to stroke:  MTHFR  gene rs1801133 SNP is decisively associated with hyper homo cy steinem i a, and is an additional risk enhancer for stroke.   None of the studied SNP, except for the rs1801133 of  MTHFR  (following regression analysis) was associated with stroke incidence in the current study. The shared minor in ﬂ uences of different allelic variants, medication effects, and biochemical traits may underlie the collaborative role in cerebral vascular disease consequence.  

# Conclusion, Limitations, and Recommendations of the Study  

Stroke is highly prevalent in Pakistan, yet the studies on elucidation of the risk factors, including novel genetic predictors or their combination effect on traditional assigned risk factors are sporadic. The current study aimed to investigate factors such as cholesterol, HDL, creatinine, and the impact of homo cyst eine or folate pathway gene polymorphisms with special relation to stroke in our local population.  

The study comprises a restricted number of participants (particularly in the TIA group) and covers control participants who are not actually disease free, the above two being predominant constraint of the current study. The  ﬁ ndings can be validated by an enhanced participant size, recruitment of disease-free controls, and we can address additional diversity by ensuring patient recruitment from tertiary care hospitals in more distant zones of the country. An additional improvement strategy is to study the effect of an individual drugs, and to increase the number of analyzed genes/SNPs to delineate the ones more robustly related to stroke and disease risk.
