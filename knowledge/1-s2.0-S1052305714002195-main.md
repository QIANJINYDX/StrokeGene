Background:  KCNK17  (potassium channel, subfamily  $\mathrm{K},$   member17) has a role in the pathogen es is of stroke. We reported previously that rs10947803 singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in  KCNK17  is associated with cerebral hemorrhage in a Chinese population. The aim of the present study was to examine other SNPs in the  KCNK17  gene that are associated with cerebral hemorrhage and other subtypes of stroke in the Chinese population.  Methods:  A total of 1356 subjects with stroke and 1225 control patients were examined by a case-control methodology. The SNPs (rs12214600, rs12195376, rs2758912, and rs10807204) in  KCNK17 gene were genotyped with the TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Results:  rs12214600 SNP in  KCNK17  was sign i cant ly associated with cerebral hemorrhage (unadjusted odds ratio  $=$   .55,  $95\%$   conﬁdence interval  $=$   .35-.86,  $P=.008,\mathbf{q}=.0328)$  ) under the allele model. After adjusting for age, sex, and hypertension, we found that the association remained signiﬁcant (odds ratio  $=$   .56,  $95\%$  conﬁdence interval  $=$   .35-.90,  $P=.0158)$  ). There was no association detected for other SNPs in  KCNK17  with cerebral hemorrhage, and none of the SNPs in KCNK17  had an association with ischemic stroke.  Conclusions:  The T carrier of an SNP (rs12214600) is associated with reduced risk of cerebral hemorrhage in the Chinese population, together with previous ﬁndings that SNPs rs10947803 and rs12214600 in the  KCNK17  gene are associated with hemorrhagic stroke, but none of the SNPs tested had an association with ischemic stroke.  KCNK17  may be important in the pathogen es is of cerebral hemorrhage.  Key Words:  Ischemic stroke—cerebral hemorrhage— KCNK17 —SNP.

# Introduction  

Stroke is one of the most common causes of death worldwide and contributes to a major burden in health care. But the prevalence, prophylaxis, and treatment in stroke may be different in various regions or race. Some researchers have found that there are some differences between Japanese and European Guidelines for the management of ischemic stroke published between 2008 and 2011.   In China, stroke is the leading type of cardiovascular disease.   Ischemic stroke has the dominant proportion, which is approximately   $43.7\%–78.9\%$   of overall strokes in Chinese population.   Cerebral hemorrhage is a signiﬁcant subtype of stroke and plays an important role in the Chinese population.   Recent epidemiologic studies in the Chinese population reveal that approximate  $30\%$   of stroke cases, even much more, can be accounted for by hemorrhagic stroke, which indicates that hemorrhagic stroke is more frequent in Chinese than in the white patients.   As a complex disease, stroke is assumed to result from both genetic and environmental factors as well as 9 their interactions ; however, its responsible genetic and molecular mechanisms have remained largely unknown.  

KCNK17  (potassium channel, subfamily K, member 17) is located in chromosome 6p21.1 in humans and belongs to 1 of the 2-pore-domain potassium channels superfamily of background  $\mathsf{K}^{+}$    channels, which generate the negative membrane potential in excitable and non excitable cells and contribute to the resting membrane potential in various tissues.   The mutations of  KCNK17  gene could bring about abnormal opening of potassium channels and then increase the concentration of extracellular potassium ion, which might produce marked dilation of cerebral blood vessels. It could play an important role in cardiovascular diseases.  

12   Since 2007, Matarin et al have identiﬁed 3 signiﬁcant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in  KCNK17  that are associated with ischemic stroke in white patients. After that, Domingues-Montanari et   $\mathsf{a l}^{13}$    replicated the ﬁnding in a Spanish cohort; however, different results, which indicate that the SNP in  KCNK17  is not associated with ischemic stroke, have been reported in Chinese pop  15   ulation. Ma et al reported that the rs10947803 SNP in KCNK17  is associated with cerebral hemorrhage in a Chinese population; however other SNPs in  KCNK17  were been tested in that report. It is necessary to investigate whether the other SNPs in  KCNK17  gene are associated with cerebral hemorrhage in a Chinese population. Therefore, we selected 4 representative SNPs (rs12214600, rs12195376, rs2758912, and rs10807204) by their minor allele frequency greater than  $10\%$   in Chinese with Haploview software (version   $4.0)^{16}$    in the block located from 39376714 bp to 39383260 bp in chromosome 6 and tested the susceptible variants in  KCNK17  associated with cerebral hemorrhage and other subtypes of stroke in the Chinese population.  

# Materials and Methods  

Subjects  

The Stroke Hypertension Investigation in Genetics (SHINING) study was conducted by the Beijing Hypertension League Institute. Patients and control subjects from 6 geographical regions in China were recruited for the case–control study between 1997 and 2000, and   $70\%$  subjects came from or nearby Beijing.   The SHINING study consisted of the subjects of Chinese Han ethnicity only.   Any stroke patients who suffered a stroke within the past 5 years were eligible to participate in the study. All patients had medical records that indicated with a diagnosis of stroke conﬁrmed by brain computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging.  

In the initial study, patients with ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic/hemorrhage stroke, subarach- noid hemorrhage, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), and crypto geni c stroke were included.   In considering the sample size of each subtype of stroke, we chose only 3 subtypes for the present study, namely, ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and TIA. Control subjects were selected according to the case–control study criteria (control subjects matched to cases by sex, age within 3 years, geographic location, and blood pressure category

  $[<\!140/90~\mathrm{\mmHg},~\geq\!140/90~\mathrm{\mmHg},$   and    ${\leq}180/105,$  ,

  ${>}180/105\ \mathrm{mmHg}])$  18   ). Data collected included age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and hypertension. Hypertension was deﬁned as having current or past anti hypertensive medication, systolic blood pressure  ${\geq}140\,\mathrm{mmHg},$  , or diastolic blood pres- sure    ${\ge}90~\mathrm{\mmHg}$  .   Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants, and the study was approved by ethics committees of the Beijing Hypertension League Institute.  

# Selection of SNPs  

After excluding the SNPs that are not representative and with less than   $10\%$   MAF in Chinese, we selected 4 SNPs (rs12214600, rs2758912, rs12195376, and rs10807204) within the position of chromosome six from 39376714 bp to 39383260 bp, which were representative SNPs in Chinese.  

# DNA Extraction and Genotyping  

Genomic DNA had been extracted from the whole blood with salting out procedure. DNA concentration was measured by NanoDrop 2000. DNA was diluted to a concentration of   $5\,\mathrm{\Deltang}/\upmu\mathrm{L}$   before we genotyped the samples. A total of 3119 participants (1559 stroke cases and 1560 controls) were recruited for the SHINING study, and of these, 2581 participants (1356 stroke cases and 1225 controls) had DNA samples available in the present study. All the selected SNPs in

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.  

Age, BMI, DBP, and SBP values are represented by mean  $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$  Hypertension indicates systolic blood pressure  ${\geq}140\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   or diastolic blood pressure  ${\geq}90\;\mathrm{mmHg}$   (or both), or taking anti hyper tensive medication.  

KCNK17 were genotyped by TaqMan Real-Time PCR (Assay ID: C_1650898_20 for rs12214600, C_31340453_20 for rs12195376, C_16289539_20 for rs2758912, C_1650893_10 for rs10807204; Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) using the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The average genotyping call rate was  $99.96\%$  .  

# Statistical Analysis  

Clinical data about continuous variables were expressed as mean  $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$   and compared by    $t.$  -tests. Univariate associations were explored with frequency tables and Pearson’s  $\chi^{2}$    tests for independent proportions. The presence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium per SNP was tested by an exact  $\chi^{2}$    good-of-ﬁt test. Concerning that the entire study group comprised 3 major types of stroke (ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and TIA), in each stratum, cases were compared with those of the corresponding control groups. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval (CI) and adjusted OR for sex, age, and hypertension under the allelic model. The false discovery rate adjustment for multiple testing probability value was given by the q value method using the PROC MULTTEST procedure in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Linkage disequilibrium analysis was conducted with the online software SNPStats.   Power calculation by the Quanto software program (version 1.2.4; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) indicated that we have more than  $75\%$  of detecting positive association under dominant model, assuming the effect size is .55 for rs12214600 with  $\mathrm{MAF}\,=\,.167$   in the subtype of cerebral hemorrhage in SHINING cohort.  

All other statistical analyses were performed with SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc.).  $P<.05$  was used to indicate statistical sign i can ce.

# Results  

The demographic characteristics of the study participants were shown in  Table 1 . The means of age and body mass index were greater in control patients than those in cases, and the proportion of hypertension was lower in control patients; however, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were not sign i cant ly different in between cases and controls because the original goal of SHINING study was to identify SNPs that predispose to stroke independent of blood pressure.  

In the present study, the percentage of ischemic stroke (1080 patients), cerebral hemorrhage (182 patients), and TIA (94 patients) in all stroke cases were   $79.7\%,$  ,   $13.4\%,$  , and  $6.9\%,$  , respectively. To conﬁrm the genetic sus ce pti bility of the SNPs in  KCNK17  with stroke in Chinese population, the SNPs (rs12214600, rs12195376, rs2758912, and rs10807204) were genotyped in 2581 participants, including 1356 cases and 1225 controls. All the SNPs conformed to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in control subjects. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium information for the four SNPs was listed in  Table 2 .  

We further analyzed the association between the SNPs of  KCNK17  with stroke subtypes, shown in  Table 3 . Our results revealed that the susceptive variant of the rs12214600 (C/T) SNP was sign i cant ly associated with cerebral hemorrhage   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=.55,$  ,  $95\%$   $\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{CI}=.35–.86,}\end{array}$   $P\,=\,.0082,\,\mathrm{q}\,=\,.0328)$  . In addition, the SNPs rs2758912

  $(\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{G})$   and rs10807204 (C/G) were associated with TIA

  $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,1.66,$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,1.09{-}2.53\$  ,    $P\,=\,.0174$   $\mathrm{~q~}=\ .0348$  and   $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,55}$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,.36{-.85},$  ,    $P=.0070$  ,  $\mathrm{~q~}=\,.0280.$  , respectively). After we adjusted for age, sex, and hypertension, the signiﬁcant associations still remained in cerebral hemorrhage (for rs12214600, OR    $=$   .56,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}~=~.35{-.90}$  ,    $P\,=\,.0158)$   and TIA (for rs2758912 and rs10807204,  $\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,1.63}$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,1.06{-}2.52$  ,    $P\,=\,.0265$  and  $\mathrm{OR}=.60,\,95\%\,\mathrm{CI}=.39\cdot.94,\,P=.0253,$  , respectively).  

Linkage d is equilibrium analysis is shown in  Figure 1 . There was no signiﬁcant linkage d is equilibrium existing among the SNPs in  KCNK17,  containing the 4 SNPs in the present study and the rs10947803 SNP in study of Ma et al.  

# Discussion  

We carried out the present study in a Chinese Han population to test the association between the SNPs (rs12214600, rs12195376, rs2758912, and rs10807204) of KCNK17  gene and subtypes of stroke. Our results revealed that the rs12214600 SNP in  KCNK17  was signiﬁ- cantly associated with reduced risk for cerebral hemorrhage and that the association remained signiﬁ- cant after adjusting for multi-testing ( Table 3 ). In a pre15   vious study, Ma et al found that the SNP (rs10947803) in  KCNK17  was associated with an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage in a Chinese population, although

Figure 1. The linkage d is equilibrium analysis was conducted with the online software, SNPStats. All the data came from the present study except that of the rs10947803 SNP, which derived from the study by Ma et al. Abbreviation: SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphisms.  

this association hadn’t been investigated in the other cohorts or in different ethnic groups. Considering the adjacent rs12214600 and rs10947803 SNPs in chromosome 6 (located within 39376714 bp and 39378588 bp, respectively) showed the associations with cerebral hemorrhage, these results indicate that the  KCNK17 gene may indeed play an important role in cerebral hemorrhage in the Chinese population. We also performed a linkage d is equilibrium analysis to determinate linkage correlation of these two SNPs ( Fig 1 ). However, these 2 SNPs were not in linkage disequilibrium   $\mathrm{{D^{\prime}}}=.036$   and  $\textsuperscript{r}=.018_{,}$  ). The effect of 2 SNPs on the risk of cerebral hemorrhage are in a different direction; to our knowledge, there is no direct evidence of how rs10947803 and rs12214600 affect the function of KCNK17 . Therefore, the underlying mechanism of the association is unclear.  

In the present study, none of the SNPs tested in KCNK17  were associated with ischemic stroke ( Table 3 ), which was consistent with the previous studies performed in the Chinese population but inconsistent with studies conducted in the white population.   After we adjusted sex, age, and hypertension, the associations remained in sign i cant ( Table 3 ). The absence of the association in the Chinese Han population may result from the heterogeneity among different ethnic groups. The current study could not be replicated the ﬁndings derived from Caucasian population albeit having enough power to detect the associations (data not shown).  

In addition, we also found that the rs2758912 and rs10807204 SNPs were respectively associated with TIA ( Table 3 ). Although the results were derived from a smaller sample sizes (94 cases and 85 controls), and passed the multi testing adjustment, it would be worth the effort to replicate the results with larger cohort with TIA phenotype.  

All the SNPs selected in the present study are located in the intron region of NM 001135111.1 in  KCNK17  gene. A recent study has revealed that the  KCNK17  gene is abundantly expressed in liver, lungs, placenta, pancreas, small intestine, and aorta. In addition, intermediate levels also are detected in brain, heart, colon, ovary, and so on, but not in skeletal muscle.   But by now, the molecular mechanism of how these SNPs’ variants affect the functions of KCNK17  still remains unclear.  

The  KCNK17  gene codes the protein TALK-2, or TASK4, which belongs to a member of the 2-pore domain super $\mathsf{K}^{+}$       $\mathsf{K}^{+}$  family of  channels. As an open rectiﬁer  channel that primarily passes outward current under physiological   $\mathsf{K}^{+}$    concentrations,  KCNK17  shares many common features with other family members, such as participating in ion ﬂuxes necessary for cell volume regulation as well as in metabolic acidosis and hypertension caused by secretion of  ${\mathrm{HCO}}_{3}^{\,-}$  . Recently, some researchers have found that the expression of  KCNK3  potassium channel gene, which codes  TASK-1 , lessens the injury from ischemic stroke, most likely by a general inﬂuence on blood pressure. According to the characteristics of the functions and distributions of  KCNK  genes, they may play important roles in stroke in humans, especially  KCNK17  in cerebral hemorrhage in the Chinese population.  

# Conclusions  

Our study shows that Tcarrier of the rs12214600 SNP is associated with reduced risk of cerebral hemorrhage, but none of the 4 SNPs in  KCNK17  is associated with ischemic stroke in the Chinese population. Together with our previous ﬁndings, the  KCNK17  gene may play an important role in cerebral hemorrhage in the Chinese population. To validate these results, further investigations, including more samples and different ethnic groups with ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and TIA, and more functional studies are needed.
