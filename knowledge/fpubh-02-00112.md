Background:  B vitamins play an important role in homo cyst eine metabolism, with vitamin de cie nci es resulting in increased levels of homo cyst eine and increased risk for stroke. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2,100 stroke patients from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) trial, a clinical trial designed to determine whether the daily intake of high-dose folic acid, vitamins   ${\sf B}_{6.}$  , and   $\mathsf{B}_{12}$   reduce recurrent cerebral infarction.  

Methods:  Extensive quality control (QC) measures resulted in a total of 737,081 SNPs for analysis. Genome-wide association analyses for baseline quantitative measures of folate, Vitamins   $\mathsf{B}_{12}$  , and   ${\sf B}_{6}$   were completed using linear regression approaches, implemented in PLINK.  

Results:  $\mathsf{S i x}$   associations met or exceeded genome-wide sign i can ce   $(P\leq5\times10^{-08})$  . For baseline Vitamin   $\mathsf{B}_{12}$  , the strongest association was observed with a non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) located in the  CUBN  gene   $(P=1.76\times10^{-13})$  onal  C c SNPs demonstrated strong associations with   $\mathsf{B}_{12}$   (  $(P\!=\!2.92\times10^{-10}$   =  ×   and 4.11  $4.11\times10^{-10})$   × ), while a second nsSNP, located in the  TCN1  gene, also reached genome-wide sign i can ce  $(P\!=\!5.14\times10^{-11})$  . For baseline m es ofVitamin   $\mathsf{B}_{6}$  , w me-wide signif-  for SNPs at the  ALPL  locus (rs1697421;  $P\!=\!7.06\times10^{-10}$   =  ×   and rs1780316;  $P\!=\!2.25\times10^{-08})$   =  × ). In addition to the six genome-wide signiﬁcant associations, nine SNPs (two for Vitamin   ${\sf B}_{6}$  , six for Vitamin   $\mathsf{B}_{12}$  , and one for folate measures) provided suggestive evidence for association   $(P\leq10^{-07})$  .  

Conclusion:  Our GWAS study has identiﬁed six genome-wide signiﬁcant associations, nine suggestive associations, and successfully replicated 5 of 16 SNPs previously reported to be associated with measures of B vitamins.The six genome-wide signiﬁcant associations are located in gene regions that have shown previous associations with measures of B vitamins; however, four of the nine suggestive associations represent novel ﬁnding and warrant further investigation in additional populations.

# INTRODUCTION  

The B vitamins constitute a group of water-soluble vitamins that play an important role in human health and cellular functions including growth and development ( 1 ). Vitamins   $\mathrm{B}_{6}$   (pyridioxine), B 9  (folic acid or folate), and   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   (cobalamin) have garnered extensive attention for their putative impacts on human health and diseases, ranging from cardiovascular disease and stroke to neuro cognitive function and depression. Spec i call y, these B vitamins are critical for the maintenance of red blood cells ( 2 ), components of the nervous ( 3 ), and immune systems ( 4 ). Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  

deﬁciency, most common in the elderly, has been associated with conditions such as anemia, and neurological abnormalities such as depression, cognitive dysfunction, and neuropathy ( 5 ). Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   deﬁciency can result in irreversible brain and nervous system damage and may be responsible for common symptoms such as fatigue and poor memory ( 6 ,  7 ). Folate (Vitamin B 9 ) is critical for fetal growth and brain development, therefore folate de cie nci es during pregnancy can result in neural tube defects in babies ( 8 ). In addition,Vitamins  $\mathrm{B}_{6},\mathrm{B}_{9}$  , and  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   serve as important factors in homo cyst eine metabolism, with vitamin de cie nci es resulting in increased levels of homo cyst eine ( 9 ,  10 ). Although controversial, elevated homo cyst eine levels are thought to increase risk for stroke ( 11 ) and vascular disease ( 12 ,  13 ).  

Multiple factors contribute to variations in B vitamin levels in humans. A balanced diet is one approach to help minimize the detrimental effects of B vitamin deﬁciency. In January 1998, the United States Food and Drug Administration required manufacturers to fortify bread and grain products with folic acid to help prevent neural tube defects due to Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{9}$   deﬁciency. These efforts have proven somewhat successful, with estimates from the 2002–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) reporting that most Americans are receiving adequate amounts of folate ( 14 ). In contrast, for Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$  , data suggest that  $5–15\%$   of elderly patients are Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   deﬁcient, including data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the NHANES study ( 15 – 17 ). Poor dietary intake, malabsorption from food, and genetic predisposition may all cause vitamin de cie nci es.Polymorphisms in genes involved in B vitamin meta bolism and processing, transport, absorption, and excretion are logical candidate genes that can inﬂuence B vitamin levels. Two such examples include human conditions Imerslund–Grasbeck syndrome (IGS) and mega l oblast ic anemia-1. IGS, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in cubilin ( CUBN ) and/or amnionless ( AMN ), was ﬁrst characterized in the 1960s ( 18 ,  19 ) and results in mega l oblast ic anemia during childhood as a result of selective mal absorption of Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$  . Additionally, genetic variants in the  CUBN  and    $A M N$   genes are responsible for the Finnish and Norwegian types of mega l oblast ic anemia-1, respectively ( 20 ,  21 ).  

Understanding the genetic factors contributing to vitamin deﬁ- ciencies offers opportunities for screening and ident i cation of high-risk individuals before the presentation of any clinical manif e stations. To date, several large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) testing for association with Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  ,  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$  , and folate have been published, resulting in more than 10 conﬁrmed loci for these traits ( 22 – 25 ). Our group has conducted a GWAS for Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  ,  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$  , and folate in an effort both to identify novel associations and replicate previously reported associations for these traits in a population of ischemic stroke patients from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial, an NIH-funded, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to determine whether the daily intake of high-dose folic acid,Vitamins  $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  , and   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   reduced recurrent cerebral infarction and a combined vascular endpoint. Unlike the previous GWAS, the VISP study population represents an ethnically diverse population of older patients that present with elevated baseline homo cyst eine levels in the top quartile, have suffered a stroke, and thus, more closely represent the elderly population that is most prone to vitamin B deﬁciency and stroke.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# SUBJECTS  

The VISP trial was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, and controlled clinical trial that enrolled patients aged 35 or older with homo cyst eine levels above the 25th percentile at screening and a non-disabling cerebral infarction (NDCI) within 120 days of random iz ation ( 26 ,  27 ). NDCI was deﬁned as an ischemic brain infarction not due to embolism from a cardiac source, characterized by the sudden onset of a neurological deﬁcit. The deﬁcit must have persisted for at least   $24\,\mathrm{h}$  , or if not, an infarction in the part of the brain corresponding to the symptoms must have been demonstrated by CT or MRI imaging. The trial was designed to determine if daily intake of a multivitamin tablet with highdose folic acid, vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  , and vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   reduced recurrent cerebral infarction and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or mortality. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily doses of the high-dose formulation (  $n\!=\!1,\!827)$  ), containing   $25\,\mathrm{mg}$  pyridoxine   $\left(\mathrm{B}_{6}\right)$  ,   $0.4\,\mathrm{mg}$   cobalamin   $(\mathrm{B}_{12})$  , and   $2.5\,\mathrm{mg}$   folic acid; or the low-dose formulation (  $n\!=\!1,\!853)$  ), containing   $200\,\upmu\mathrm{g}$   pyridoxine,  $6\,\upmu\mathrm{g}$   cobalamin, and   $20\,\upmu\mathrm{g}$   folic acid. Enrollment in VISP began in August 1997, and was completed in December 2002, with 3,680 participants enrolled from 55 clinic sites across the U.S. and Canada and one site in Scotland. All human research was approved by the relevant institutional review boards (IRBs), and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The VISP study protocol was approved by the IRBs of Wake Forest School of Medicine (coordinating center) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine (statistical center). The local IRB for each of the individual recruiting sites approved the VISP protocol and all participants provided written, informed consent. VISP data analysis by the Genomics and Randomized Trial Network (GARNET) was approved by University of Virginia School of Medicine IRB.  

# GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDY IN VISP  

A subset of VISP participants provided consent for inclusion in genetic studies. These participants were included in the GWAS component of VISP, supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Grant U01 HG005160, as part of the Genomics and Randomized Trials Network (GARNET); dbGaP Study Accession: phs000343.v3.p1. Samples were genotyped at the Johns Hopkins Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad_v1-0_B BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Individuals were excluded if they were unexpected duplicates or had gender discrepancies. A total of 2,100 individuals were included in the ﬁnal genetic analyses; summary statistics are provided in  Table 1 . These subjects consisted of 1,725 individuals of European descent, 258 individuals of African descent, and 117 individuals classiﬁed as others.  

# BIOMARKER MEASUREMENTS IN VISP  

As previously described ( 28 ), basal levels of folate and Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   were determined by the central laboratory at Oregon Regional Primate Research Center using single radio as says of folate andVitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   (Bio Rad Quanta phase II,Bio Rad Diagnostics,Hercules,

CA, USA). For measures of Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  , EDTA plasma samples were analyzed using a commercially available method for plasma Pyridoxine   $5^{\prime}$    Phosphate (ALPCO Inc Windham, NH, USA). The principle of the assay is as follows:  $^3\mathrm{H}$  -tyrosine is de carboxyl a ted by the vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{6}$   dependent enzyme tyrosine a pode car box las e to  $^3\mathrm{H}$  -tyramine. The activity of tyrosine a pode car box las e is quantitatively dependent on the amount of PLP present in the reaction mixture. The  $^3\mathrm{H}$  -tyramine thus produced is selectively extracted into the scintillation cocktail and can be measured by liquid scintillation counting. The excess  $^3\mathrm{H}$  -tyrosine remains in the aqueous phase and is not measured.  

# STATISTICAL ANALYSES  

Extensive quality control (QC) measures were performed, resulting in a total of 737,081 SNPs for analysis. QC measures included ﬁltering SNPs based on missing call rate, Mendelian errors in control trios,deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in controls, discordant calls in duplicate samples, sex differences in allele frequency or he ter oz y gos it y, and minor allele frequency (MAF) ( 29 ). Brieﬂy, samples were clustered and genotypes determined using Genome Studio (version 2010.2). For initial QC, SNPs meeting one or more of the following criteria were excluded: call rate    ${<}85\%$  , more than one replicate HapMap error, or cluster separation    ${<}0.2$  . Genotype calls for individual chromosomes in samples with large chromosomal anomalies   $(>\!10\,\mathrm{Mb})$   or missing call rate    ${>}5\%$   were ﬁltered out. Furthermore, samples with overall missing call rates    ${>}5\%$   and SNPs with call rates    ${\tt<}95\%$  and Hardy–Weinberg    $P$  -values  ${\leq}10^{-4}$    were excluded from subsequent analyses. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), utilizing the software KING ( 30 ), was performed to address con founders due to population substructure. Genome-wide association analyses for baseline quantitative measures of folate, and Vitamins   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   and  $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  were performed using linear regression approaches, assuming an additive model, as implemented in PLINK; using age, sex, and the top 10 principal components as covariates. Inverse normal transformation was performed for each of the quantitative traits, prior to analysis. Inverse normal transformations were used to maintain ranks of the trait for each individual and minimize the impact of outliers while also allowing for sufﬁcient power. Regression coe f ci ents (beta),coefﬁcient T-statistic (STAT),and    $P$  -values

 (asymptotic    $P$  -value for    $T_{\|}$  -statistic) were calculated for the tested

 (minor) allele. The proportion of total variance explained   $(h^{2})$   was calculated as    $h^{2}\,{=}\,\mathrm{Beta}^{2}\times2\times\mathrm{MAF}\times\left(1{\mathrm{-MAF}}\right)$  . Our GWAS scan results showed no evidence for inﬂation (GC lambda  $\leq1.013$   in all scans.).  

# RESULTS  

We identiﬁed six associations that meet or exceed genome-wide sign i can ce   $\phantom{}\!\!\!(P\leq5\times10^{-08}$  ;  Table 2 ; Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). Of these six associations, four were for Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$  , while the remaining two were for Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  . The strongest evidence of association was observed for baseline Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   $(P\!=\!1.76\times10^{-13}$  ;   $\mathtt{b e t a}\!=\!-0.22)$  ) with a non-synonymous SNP

 (nsSNP), located on chromosome 10 in the  CUBN  gene. Two additional  CUBN  intronic SNPs ( Figure 1 ) were also strongly t  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   (  $\phantom{}P\,=\,2.92\times10^{-10}$  ;   $\mathsf{o e t a}\!=\!-0.19$   and  $4.11\times10^{-10}$   ×  $\mathtt{b e t a}\!=\!-0.18)$   = − 0.18). A second nsSNP, located on chromosome 11 in the trans coba lam in 1 ( TCN1 ) gene ( Figure 2 ), was also associated with baseline measures of Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   $\phantom{+}P\,=\,5.14\times10^{-11}$  ;  $\mathtt{b e t a}\!=\!-0.29)$  ). The two genome-wide signiﬁ- cant associations for Vitamin B  $\mathrm{B}_{6}$   measures ( Figure 3 ) were located in the alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), liver/bone/kidney gene 1;    $P\,{=}\,7.06\times10^{-10}$  ,  $\mathrm{\beta=0.173}$   and rs1780316;  $P\,{=}\,2.25\times10^{-08}$   =  × ;   $\mathtt{b e t a}\!=\!-0.325)$  . Although not reaching the genome-wide sign i can ce threshold, our GWAS study has identiﬁed nine additional SNPs with suggestive   $\left(P\leq10^{-0\dot{7}}\right.$  ) evidence of association, two for measures of Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  , six for measures of Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$  , and one for measures of folate ( Table 2 ). A cluster of suggestive associations for Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   was observed on chromosome 19, near the fu co syl transfer as e 2 ( FUT2)  gene.    $P$  - e four associated SNPs ranged from   $9.33\times{\bar{1}}0^{-07}$    to  $2.67\times10^{-07}$   × . Individually, eac sociated SNP explains only a small amount of the variance (  $(h^{2})$  ) for each trait (ranging from 0.009 to 0.021).  

In addition to our genome-wide analyses,we performed a lookup of 16 SNPs previously associated with measures of vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  (  $n\!=\!1.$  ) ( 22 ), vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   (  $\phantom{0}n\!=\!12$  ) ( 22 – 24 ,  31 ), and folate (  $\left(n=3\right)$  )

 ( 22 ,  23 ,  25 ). Of the 16 SNPs previously reported in the literature, genotype data were available for 10 of the reported SNPs, while surrogate SNPs in high linkage d is equilibrium (LD) (  $r^{2}>0.9)$  ) or the most signiﬁcant SNP within   $100\,\mathrm{lb}$   of the reported SNP were reported for the remaining six SNPs. Accounting for multiple testing (  $\phantom{0}P\!=\!0.05/16\phantom{0}$  ), ﬁve of the 16 SNPs, located in  ALPL ,  MS4A3 , TCN1 ,  CUBN , and  FUT2 , were successfully replicated (  $\left(P\leq0.003\right)$  ) in our study ( Table 3 ; Table S1 in Supplementary Material). For comparison, association results for the un transformed B vitamin measures are reported in Table S2 in Supplementary Material.  

# DISCUSSION  

We performed a GWAS for measures of Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$  , Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  , and folate by evaluating 737,081 SNPs in 2,100 participants from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial. We observed six associations that reached genome-wide signi  $\left(P\leq10^{-08}\right)$  ), an additional nine SNPs with suggestive (  $\left(P\leq10^{-07}\right.$   ≤ ) evidence of association, while replicating ﬁve

previously reported SNP associations. The most convincing associations were observed for measures of Vitamin B12 at the  CUBN and  TCN1  loci and the  ALPL  locus for measures of Vitamin B6.  

Although we did not observe any genome-wide signiﬁcant associations for folate, we did detect suggestive evidence for association  $\phantom{}P=9.75\times10^{-07}\phantom{}$  )nearthe MYT1L  gene,located on chromosome

2. Interestingly, genetic variations at this locus have been associated with depression ( 32 ) and schizophrenia ( 33 – 35 ). This locus may help explain the recent data positively correlating serum folate levels with cognitive test scores in children ( 36 ); suggesting further evaluation of the effects of folate levels in the elderly are warranted.  

The most robust associations for Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   levels were observed at the  CUBN ,  FUT2 , and  TCN1  loci ( Table 2 ). A cluster of ﬁve SNPs spanning the  CUBN  gene provided evidence for association with Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   measures (  $P$  -values ranging from  $9.48\times10^{-07}$    to   $1.75\times10^{-13}$  ). The most sign i cant ly associated

SNP in this region, rs1801222, was a non-synonymous variant resulting in a missense mutation, Phenylalanine to Serine. These results were not surprising considering rs1801222 was previously associated with Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   measures ( 22 ) and the protein expressed by  CUBN  forms a receptor complex responsible for Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   internal iz ation in the ileum ( 37 ). Furthermore, genetic variants in  CUBN  are responsible for the Finnish type of megaloblastic anemia-1 ( 38 ) in humans and more broadly for IGS in canines as well ( 39 ,  40 ). A second cluster of suggestive associations near  FUT2  gene were consistent with previously reported associations in this region ( 24 ,  25 ,  41 ).  

A second missense mutation (rs34324219), located in the Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   binding protein,  TCN1  gene was associated with baseline measures of Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$     $(P\!=\!5.148\times10^{-11})$  ). The nsSNP, rs34324219,results in an As part ic acid to Tyrosine substitution and represents the second most signiﬁcant association in our study. In the same VISP population, our group previously detected associations between genetic variants of the related gene,  TCN2 , and recurrent stroke risk ( 42 ). Although  TCN1  is a logical candidate gene inﬂuencing Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   measures in this region, associations with variants in the nearby   $(\sim\!200\,\mathrm{kb})$   MS4A3  gene ( 24 ) suggest that multiple genes in this region may impact Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   levels. In an attempt to replicate the associations observed in MS4A3  by Lin et al. ( 24 ) (rs2298585), we detected modest eviion for the surrogate SNP, rs7929589 (  $\cdot r^{2}\!=\!0.39$  ;  $P\,{=}\,8.67\times10^{-04}$   =  × ;  Table 3 ). The protein encoded by  MS4A3  has been proposed to function as a he ma top oie tic cell cycle regulator ( 43 ), another potential link to the anemia observed in individuals with Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$   deﬁciency ( 44 ).  

For measures of Vitamin   $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  , associations at the ALPL locus were most robust. Two variants at this locus reached genome (rs1697421;    $P\,{=}\,7.06\times10^{-10}$    and rs1780316;  $P\,{=}\,2.25\times10^{-08}$   =  × ). GWAS asso ions for variants near  ALPL have been reported for Vitamin B  $\mathrm{B}_{6}$   ( 22 ). In addition, this region also harbors GWAS associations with traits ranging from TNF α response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( 45 ) to hematologic traits ( 46 ). While the physiological function of ALPLs are unknown, and no direct correlations have been made between  $A L P L$   variants and cognitive function, tissue non-speciﬁc ALPL is increased in Alzheimer’s disease patients ( 47 ) .  Furthermore, Alzheimer’s disease patients have an increased risk of suffering a stroke ( 48 ).  

The data were collected as part of a randomized clinical trial is a systematic and standardized fashion, which is a major strength of the study. VISP used centralized laboratory analysis on all samples that complied with strict quality standards. The study population all had ischemic stroke and had elevated measures of serum homo cyst eine,which might limit general iz ability. However, we replicated a substantial proportion of the previously identiﬁed genetic variants from studies using a more “general population.” All participants in the VISP clinical trial were 35 years of age or older and suffered a stroke within 120 days of enrollment. This study population also represents an older group of individuals (mean age 67.2 years) that is most prone to vitamin deﬁciency and subsequent public health concerns including dementia and stroke. We are unable to make any comparisons in normal, healthy individuals, or assess the relation of such associations on stroke risk and other vascular disorders;however,collectively,our n ding may provide some insight into the genetic factors inﬂuencing measures of B vitamins, in a vulnerable population. Although some dietary measures were collected as part of the VISP trial, we were not able to incorporate dietary “exposure” as a covariate in our analyses. Thus, we cannot identify gene by environmental interactions.  

In summary, we performed a GWAS for measures of Vitamin  $\mathrm{B}_{6}$  ,  $\mathrm{B}_{12}$  , and folate observing six genome-wide signiﬁcant associations, nine suggestive associations, and successfully replicating 5 of   $16\:S N P s$   previously reported in the literature. Our study is the ﬁrst of its kind evaluating genetic contributors for measurements of B vitamins in a stroke population. Additionally, this knowledge could lead to genetic screening approaches, which could identify pre-symptomatic individuals that could beneﬁt from interventions such as enhanced vitamin supplement ation prior to clinical manifestations.
