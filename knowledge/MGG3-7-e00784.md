# Abstract  

Background:  The inter cellular adhesion molecule‐1 (ICAM‐1)/leukocyte function  associated antigen‐1 (LFA‐1) adhesion system regulates leukocyte interactions, mi‑ gration, and adhesion, and appears to play an important role in atherosclerosis and  thrombosis. Therefore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ICAM‐1  gene may strongly influence the expression and biological activity of ICAM‐1 and  play a potentially important role in the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke. In the current  meta‐analysis, we investigated the relationship between the ICAM‐1 gene K469E  SNP and the risk of ischemic stroke.  

Methods:  Two investigators independently searched PubMed, Web of Science,  Google Scholar, WANFANG, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)  and J‐STAGE for studies published from January 2000 to February 2019 without  language restriction. The association of K469E polymorphism and ischemic stroke in  three genetic models (allelic, recessive, and dominant) were evaluated using Pooled  odds ratios (ORs) with  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs).  

Results:  Our study included 20 studies from four continents and four different coun‑ tries, including 3,137 cases and 15,382 controls. Meta‐analysis results did not show  a significant association between K469E polymorphism of ICAM‐1 gene and is‑ chemic stroke when assuming allelic model (OR: 1.12;  $95\%$   CI: 0.8 to 1.55;  $p=0.51$  ;   $I^{2}\,{=}\,93\%$  ) or recessive model (OR: 1.28;  $95\%$   CI: 0.89 to 1.84;  $p=0.18;I^{2}=82\%)$   or  dominant model (OR: 1.20;  $95\%$   CI: 0.92 to 1.56;  $p=0.17$  ;  $I^{2}=85\%$  ). However, in  all three genetic models, subgroup analysis revealed that the K469E polymorphism  of the ICAM‐1 gene is associated with ischemic stroke in the Caucasian population.  

Conclusion:  K469E polymorphism of ICAM‐1 gene might be a risk factor for is‑ chemic stroke in Caucasians, which suggested that K469E polymorphism might help  in early identification of those at risk and help in primary prevention of ischemic  stroke.

# 1   |   BACKGROUND  

Globally, stroke is the second leading cause of death after  ischemic heart disease and the leading cause of long‐term  disability. Approximately,   $80\%$   of new strokes are ischemic  in origin,   $51\%$   stroke death, and   $58\%$   of stroke Disability‐ Adjusted Life Year (DALY) are because of ischemic stroke  (Feigin et al., 2015). Ischemic stroke is thought to be the  result of interactions between genetic and environmental  factors (Boehme, Esenwa, & Elkind, 2017). There is strong  evidence from studies that genetic susceptibility, in addition  to recognized risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, di‑ abetes, obesity, and advanced age, contributes to the develop‑ ment of stroke (Boehme et al., 2017). In addition, people with  a family history of stroke are more likely to have a stroke.  Therefore, understanding these genetic influences may lead  to better prevention and intervention of stroke.  

Vascular inflammation, characterized by the recruitment  and adhesion of circulating leukocytes by cell adhesion  molecules in the endothelium, plays an important role in  the pathogen es is of atherosclerosis (Galkina & Ley, 2007).  Inter cellular adhesion molecule‐1 (ICAM‐1), a member of  the immunoglobulin superfamily, is a surface glycoprotein  expressed on the vascular endothelium and is the major li‑ gand for leukocyte function‐associated antigen‐1 (LFA‐1),  a member of the integrin superfamily (Wee, Oh, Jo, & Jun,  2009). The ICAM‐1/LFA‐1 adhesion system regulates leu‑ kocyte interactions, migration and adhesion and appears to  play an important role in early atherosclerosis (Wee et al.,  2009). Therefore, ICAM‐1 is an important factor in throm‑ bosis and may play an important role in ischemic stroke. The  human ICAM1 gene is located on chromosome 19p13.3 to  13.2, spanning   $15.5~\mathrm{kb}$   of genomic DNA, including 7 exons  and 6 introns (Vora, Rosenbloom, Beaudet, & Cottingham,  1994). K469E/Lys469glu/rs5498 is a single nucleotide poly‑ morphism (SNP) located in exon 6 of the ICAM‐1 gene (Vora  et al., 1994). It occurs due to the C to T polymorphism, re‑ sulting in a change in glutamate   $\mathrm{(E)}$   to lysine (K) in the im‑ mu no globulin‐like domain 5 of the ICAM‐1 protein (Vora et  al., 1994). The SNP of ICAM‐1 gene may strongly influence  the expression and biological activity of ICAM‐1, and has  a potentially important role in the pathogen es is of ischemic  stroke.  

Multitudes of studies have been conducted to determine  the association between K469E SNPs and ischemic stroke,  but their results are inconsistent. A meta‐analyses of 12  studies have been conducted previously to elucidate the  association between K469E polymorphism and the risk of  ischemic stroke (Zhang et al., 2014). However, the meta‐ analysis included only Chinese studies in their analysis. To  the best of our knowledge, this is the largest meta‐anal‑ ysis, including Caucasian, Black, and Asian population,  conducted till now to determine the association between  K469E polymorphisms and risk of ischemic stroke. Our  meta‐analysis differs from previous meta‐analysis by inclu‑ sion of 20 studies, inclusion of major ethnicity, inclusion  of more recent studies. Therefore, we chose to update the  meta‐analysis of this issue to provide more accurate evi‑ dence. In this study, we conducted extensive review of the  literature and conducted a meta‐analysis to assess the rela‑ tionship between the ICAM‐1 gene K469E polymorphism  and susceptibility to ischemic stroke.  

# 2   |   METHODS  

# 2.1   |   Ethical compliance  

All collected data were extracted from published studies,  and there is no ethical issue. This current meta‐analysis was  conducted in accordance with the guidance of the Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses  (PRISMA) statement (Liberati et al., 2009).  

# 2.2   |   Literature search  

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar,  WANFANG, China National Knowledge Infrastructure  (CNKI), and J‐STAGE for studies published January 2000– February 2019. Searches were conducted using the keywords 

 ‘“ICAM‐1 gene polymorphism”’ or “K469E polymorphism 

 “or “rs5498 polymorphism” or ‘“Lys469glu polymorphism”’  in combination with “stroke” or ‘“ischemic stroke”’ or ‘“cer‑ ebro vascular disease”’ or ‘“cerebral infarction”’. Titles and  abstracts were then screened and the full text of all the papers  that were considered to possibly meet the inclusion criteria  was obtained. The cited references of retrieved articles were  manually checked to identify any additional eligible studies.  Two authors (GN and YK) screened and retrieved reports and  excluded irrelevant studies. Any uncertainty about the eligi‑ bility of these studies were solved by discussion with all the  authors.  

# 2.3   |   Eligibility criteria  

We included studies that were conducted on human sub‑ jects and the studies were searched without any limitations  on language. In this meta‐analysis, all included studies  met the following criteria: (a) case–control studies focused  on the association between K469E polymorphism and is‑ chemic stroke susceptibility; (b) patients with ischemic  stroke were diagnosed with neuro imaging confirmed by  neurologist; and (c) there were sufficient data of the geno‑ types in the case–control groups to evaluate the ORs and   $95\%$   CIs. The exclusion criteria were: (a) publications with  overlapping cases and controls from the similar study;  (b) no genotypic data available; and (c) publications with  patients with card i oem boli c ischemic stroke or hemor‑ rhagic stroke.  

# 2.4   |   Data abstraction and assessment of  methodological quality  

The relevant data from each study were independently ex‑ tracted by two reviewers (GN and YK) using a standardized,  structured form including the first author, type of design,  site of study, patient ethnicity, year of publication, sample  size of cases and controls, control design, Hardy–Weinberg  equilibrium, source of DNA, genotyping method, and data  of the genotypes in the case–control groups. The methodo‑ logical quality of each study was assessed independently by  two reviewers (GN and YK) using the parameters previously  used by (Kumar et al., 2016). In this scale, following sec‑ tions were included for assessment of methodological qual‑ ity: representative ness of cases, source of controls, matching  of controls, ascertainment of cases, ascertainment of con‑ trols, blinding while genotyping, genotyping methods,  Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and association assessment.  Maximum score of 2 can be provided in each sections, except  source of controls (maximum 3), ascertainment of controls  (maximum 1), blinding while genotyping (maximum1), and  association assessment (maximum1). Methodological quality  of scale score varies from 0 to 16, in which higher score rep‑ resents the better quality and lower score represents the lower  quality. Any discrepancies during data extraction and quality  assessment were resolved by discussion with all the authors.  

# 2.5   |   Statistical analysis  

The association between K469E polymorphism and ischemic  stroke susceptibility was evaluated by calculating the pooled  ORs and   $95\%$   CIs. Heterogeneity between the included stud‑ ies was first determined with Cochran's   $\boldsymbol{Q}$   test and   $I^{2}$   test.  The presence of   $P$   values above 0.1 or   $I^{2}$   more than   $50\%$  ,  was considered as an indicator of significant heterogeneity.  When significant heterogeneity was present, we selected the  random‐effects model to calculate the effects size. Three ge‑ netic models were examined, the allelic model (E allele vs.  K allele), the dominant model   $(\mathrm{EE}\,+\,\mathrm{EE}$   vs. KK), and re‑ cessive model (EE vs.   $\mathrm{ENK}+\mathrm{KK})$  . Subgroup analyses were  conducted according to ethnicity and methodological qual‑ ity evaluation. Sensitivity analysis was performed to exam‑ ine the stability of analysis. Meta‐regression was performed  to determine whether methodological quality of study have  role in effect size associated with K469E polymorphism.  Egger's linear regression test and Begg's test were used  for the identification of publication biases. Meta‐analysis,

FIGURE 1  Flow of systematic  literature search and selection  

Meta‐regression, Egger's linear regression test, and Begg's  test were performed in Comprehensive Meta‐Analysis soft‑ ware (CMA 3.3, Biostat, Englewood, NJ, 2014).  

# 3   |   RESULTS  

# 3.1   |   Literature search  

The results of the systematic literature search and selec‑ tion are summarized in Figure 1. We identified 226 articles  through database searching. After exclusion of duplicates,  188 articles remained and after screening titles and abstracts,  55 relevant abstracts remained. After application of inclusion  and exclusion criteria, 20 studies were chosen for final analy‑ sis and the data were extracted.  

# 3.2   |   Study and patient characteristics  

Our research included 20 studies from four continents and  four different countries and included 3,137 cases and 15,382  controls. Fifteen studies were from China (Geng, 2011;  Guo, Liu, & Guo, 2011; Huihua et al., 2016; Li et al., 2009;  Liu, 2005; Shang, 2004; Sun & Zhang, 2005; Sun, Wu, &  Deng, 2009; Wang et al., 2015; Wei, Liu, Huang, Tang, &  Meng, 2005; Xing, Song, Hongjun, & Zhang, 2006; You,  Huang, & Liu, 2007; Zhang, Cheng, Peng, Wang, & Peng,  2007; Zhang & Zhang, 2012; Zhou, Zhu, & Sun, 2007), two  studies were from Italy (Flex et al., 2004; Pola et al., 2003),  two studies from Egypt (Mohy, Ali, & Omar, 2015; Motawi,  Shaker, Taha, & Abdel Raheem, 2012), one study was from  the United States (Volcik, Ballantyne, Hoogeveen, Folsom,  & Boerwinkle, 2010). Caucasian subjects were included in  six studies (Flex et al., 2004; Geng, 2011; Mohy et al., 2015;  Motawi et al., 2012; Pola et al., 2003; Volcik et al., 2010),  black subjects were included in one (Volcik et al., 2010), and  Asians were included in rest of the studies. The publication  date ranged from 2003 (Pola et al., 2003) to 2016 (Huihua et  al., 2016). All included studies have case–control designs.  In all of the included studies, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium  was reached in the control population except in one (Zhou et  al., 2007). Polymerase chain reaction‐restriction fragment  length polymorphism (PCR‐RFLP) was most common form  of genotyping. However, some studies used TaqMan PCR  (Volcik et al., 2010), T‐gradient PCR (Motawi et al., 2012),  and TaKaRa PCR kits (Wang et al., 2015). Controls were  population‐based in the 16 studies but hospital based in four  (Flex et al., 2004; Liu, 2005; Pola et al., 2003; Zhang et al.,  2007). Allelic data were not available in one study (Volcik  et al., 2010) and genotypic data were incomplete in one  study (Mohy et al., 2015). According to quality assessment  tools, the methodological quality score ranged from 8 to 12.  None of the study were of low quality. All study and patient  characteristics are tabulated in Table 1.  

# 3.3   |   Meta‐analysis  

Due to high heterogeneity within studies in all three genetic  models, we used random‑effects model to estimate pooled  ORs and   $95\%$   CIs. Meta‐analysis results did not show a  significant association between K469E polymorphism of  ICAM‐1 gene and ischemic stroke when assuming allelic  model (OR: 1.12;  $95\%$   CI: 0.8 to 1.55;   $p=0.51;I^{2}=93\%)$   or  recessive model (OR: 1.28;   $95\%$   CI: 0.89 to 1.8  $;4;p=0.18$  ;   $I^{2}=82\%$   or dominant model (OR: 1.20;   $95\%$   CI: 0.92 to  1.56;  $,p=0.17;I^{2}=85\%)$  . Forest plot of the result for allelic,  recessive, and dominant model is demonstrated in Figures  2‒4 respectively. There was no evidence of publication bias  on allelic model (Egger's test:  $p=0.24$  ; Begg's test:  $p=0.2,$  ),  recessive model (Egger's test:  $p=0.9$  ; Begg's test:  $p=0.79$  ),  and dominant model (Egger's test:   $p\,=\,0.27$  ; Begg's test:   $p=0.36)$  ). In addition, on inspection of funnel plot, publica‑ tion bias was not obvious. Funnel plot for detection of publi‑ cation bias in allelic, recessive model, and dominant model is  demonstrated in Figures 5‒7 respectively.  

# 3.4   |   Sensitivity test, subgroup analysis, and  meta‐regression  

For all three genetic models, we sequentially excluded single  study from the pooled analysis and recalculated the summary  ORs to check whether the summary ORs were significantly  changed. The recalculated ORs were similar indicating sta‑ bility of analysis. We performed subgroup analysis based on  ethnicity and source of recruitment of controls. In all three  genetic models, subgroup analysis showed that K469E pol‑ ymorphism of ICAM‐1 gene was associated with ischemic  stroke in the Caucasians population. Similarly in all three  models of inheritance, the subgroup analysis based on source  of recruitment of controls showed that K469E polymorphism  was associated with ischemic stroke in subgroup of studies  that recruited controls from hospital setting. The details of  subgroup analysis can be seen in Table 2. We used meta‐re‑ gression analysis to explore whether methodological quality  scores of included studies play an important role in the as‑ sociation between K469E polymorphism and ischemic stroke  risk. In all three genetic models, we found that quality scores  were not significant predictors of the effect size for the as‑ sociation between K469E polymorphism and ischemic stroke  risk (allelic:   $p=0.66$  , recessive:   $p\,=\,0.06$  , and dominant:   $p=0.24)$  . Meta‐regression plot is shown in Figures 8‒10.

adhesion molecules like vascular cell adhesion molecules  (VCAM) and ICAM‐1 which binds to LFA‐1 of monocytes  and T lymphocytes and help them migrate into intima under  the influence of locally produced chemokines (Wee et al.,  2009). Monocytes transform into macrophages in the intima  and ph ago cyto se lipoprotein s including oxidized lipoprotein s  and transform into lipid‐laden foam cells. These oxidized  LDL further augments macrophage activation and cytokine  production starting a vicious cycle of leukocyte adhesion and  cytokine production (Libby, 2002, 2012). In addition, both  naive and oxidized LDL increase ICAM‐1 expression in  damaged blood vessels and promote atherosclerosis (Curtis  et al., 2011; Kita et al., 2001). Studies have shown that  ICAM‐1 mediated neutrophil adhesion plays an important  role in the path o physiology of evolutionary stroke (Connolly  et al., 1996). ICAM‐1 knockout mice show reduced leuko‑ cyte adhesion, small infarction, improved cerebral blood  flow, and reduced mortality after cerebral ischemia and rep‑ erfusion (Kitagawa et al., 2003). Clinical studies have shown  increased expression of ICAM‐1 in brain and increased cir‑ culating levels of soluble ICAM‐1 and cerebrospinal fluid  ICAM‐1 following ischemic stroke (Bitsch, Klene, Murtada,  Prange, & Rieckmann, 1998; Deng et al., 2005; Ferrarese et  al., 1999; Love & Barber, 2001). In addition, soluble ICAM‐1  levels are also associated with neurological deterioration fol‑ lowing ischemic stroke (Deng et al., 2005). All of the afore‑ mentioned studies suggest that ICAM‐1 may be involved in  the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke.  

The K469E polymorphism is a non‐synonymous SNP lo‑ cated in the fifth immunoglobulin‐like domain of ICAM‐1,  which is required for protein dimer iz ation, surface presenta‑ tion, and so lub i liz ation (Miller et al., 1995; Vora et al., 1994).  It results in a change in glutamate (E) to lysine (K) in the im‑ mu no globulin‐like domain 5 of the ICAM‐1 protein, which  is critical for the activity of the ICAM‐1 protein to interact  with LFA‐1 (Zhao et al., 2013; Wee et al., 2009). In addition,  one study showed that this polymorphism affects ICAM‐1  mRNA splicing patterns and TPA‐induced apoptosis (Iwao,  Morisaki, & Morisaki, 2004). Recent studies have shown a  strong correlation between the K469E polymorphism and  baseline soluble ICAM‐1 levels (Paré et al., 2011; Zee et al.,  2007). Therefore, the K469E polymorphism of the ICAM‐1  gene may strongly influence the expression and biological  activity of ICAM‐1 and have a potentially important role in  the inflammation, atherosclerosis, and pathogen es is of isch‑ emic stroke.

#  

# FIGURE 3  Forest plot of the result for recessive model  

In the present meta‐analysis, we investigated the associ‑ ation between K469E polymorphism of ICAM‐1 gene and  risk of ischemic stroke. Meta‐analysis found that in allelic  model, recessive model, and dominant model of inheri‑ tance, K469E polymorphism in the ICAM‐1 gene is not as‑ sociated with ischemic stroke susceptibility. The results of  all genetic models are consistent with previously published  meta‐analyses that include only the Chinese population  (Ming‐Jie Zhang et al., 2014). After conducting the sub‑ group analysis by ethnicity, the K469E polymorphism was  found to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke in Caucasian  population in all the three models of inheritance. Different  genetic backgrounds in Caucasians, Asians, and Blacks  might contribute to this inconsistency. Of the 20 studies  included, only 6 were Caucasian studies, which may have  affected the true association of Caucasian ICAM‐1 poly‑ morphism with ischemic stroke. (Flex et al., 2004; Li et  al., 2009; Mohy et al., 2015; Motawi et al., 2012; Pola et  al., 2003; Volcik et al., 2010). Thus, additional studies with  larger cohorts are necessary. Although not statistically sig‑ nificant, Blacks with the K469E polymorphism showed a  reduced risk of ischemic stroke. However, only one study  included the Black population and the results cannot be  generalized (Volcik et al., 2010). Further large scale studies  with Black subjects are needed to clarify this association.  In all three models of inheritance, the subgroup analysis  based on source of recruitment of controls showed that  K469E polymorphism was associated with ischemic stroke  in subgroup of studies that recruited controls from hospital  setting. The reason for strong association seen in subgroup  of studies that recruited controls from hospital setting can  be that half of the studies in this subgroup are from Europe  with Caucasian population. Thus ethnicity can be a con‑ founder in this association.  

In addition to the K469E polymorphism of the ICAM‐1  gene, a study has shown that the ICAM‐1 gene G1548A  polymorphism is an independent risk factor for the devel‑ opment of ischemic stroke (Lu, Liu, Wu, Chen, & Hwang,  2013). In accordance to our study, a meta‐analysis showed  that the K469E polymorphism in the ICAM‐1 gene may in‑ crease individuals' susceptibility to diabetic micro vascular  complications, including diabetic ne phr opa thy and diabetic  ret in opa thy. However, in their research, the susceptibility of  Asians was far‐reaching, which contradicts our findings (Su  et al., 2013). Similarly, a meta‐analysis by Shengqiang et al.  showed that the ICAM‐1 gene K469E polymorphism may be

FIGURE 4  Forest plot of the result for dominant model  

a risk factor for coronary artery disease (Zou et al., 2014).  Flex et al. also found that the ICAM‐1 gene K469E poly‑ morphism was significantly and independently associated  with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) (Flex et  al., 2007). Similarly, Gaetani et al. showed that the presence  of the EE genotype significantly independently increased the  risk of PAOD (Gaetani et al., 2002). Popović et al in their  study found that the EE genotype of the K469E polymor‑ phism of the ICAM‐1 gene was associated with a more rapid  progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2  diabetes mellitus than other genotypes (Gaspar et al., 2016).  

Statistically significant heterogeneity across studies was  observed in all genotype models (  $I^{2}$   ranged from  $82\%$   to  $93\%$  ).  Significant heterogeneity was also found in all subgroups in  

![](images/c0b2a47aed9072b7665e64dd4f6f422ff901fbf140ec1bf09493ddec1113a5e4.jpg)

all genotype models (  $I^{2}$   ranged from   $53\%$   to   $94\%$  ), except in  hospital based subgroup of dominant model. There could be  several reasons for these he te rogen ei ties. First, most of these  studies had small sample size. Second, different strategies  were applied in various studies, including control source,  population stratification, phenotype selection, genotyping  methods, etc. Moreover, heterogeneity may also be due to the  variations in ethnicity, age, and environmental factors.  

Our study has several advantages. First, this is the  largest meta‐analysis on this issue, including 20 stud‑ ies and 3,137 cases and 15,382 controls. Second, we  included all Caucasian, black, and Asian populations  to demonstrate the association between the K469E  polymorphism and ischemic stroke. Third, we con‑ ducted a comprehensive search, not limited to English  literature. We searched the Chinese database and ex‑ tracted 13 papers in Chinese. Fourth, in most of the  included studies, control subjects did not deviate from  the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Fifth, we performed  our analysis in allelic, recessive, and dominant model  of inheritance. Finally, in our analysis, publication bias  is not obvious.  

There were a few limitations in our study. First, some  studies included in the meta‐analysis had small sample  size and may have provided inconsistent results due to low  statistical power. Second, stroke risk varies as per specific  subtypes of stroke; however, none of the studies included in  the meta‐analysis presented the data of subtype of stroke;  therefore, meta‐analysis based on stroke subtype could not  be performed. Third, significant heterogeneity was evident  in our meta‐analysis. Lastly, multiple factors can influence  the development of ischemic stroke, especially the gene‐gene  interaction and gene‐environment interaction, which were not  analyzed due to lack of sufficient data.  

Despite these limitations, our meta‐analysis indicated  that Caucasians with the ICAM‐1 gene K469E polymor‑ phism are susceptible to ischemic stroke. In order to explore  clear conclusions, further elaborate large‐scale epidemio‑ logical studies, including all ethnic groups from different  geographic locations are required to validate these findings.

# 5   |   CONCLUSION  

Evidence suggests that K469E polymorphism of ICAM‐1  is a risk factor for ischemic stroke susceptibility among  Caucasians. There is hope that K469E polymorphism may  serve as a marker of risk for multigenic complex disease  ischemic stroke and might help in early identification of at  risk individuals and form preventive strategies. Considering  the importance of ICAM‐1 pathogen es is of ischemic stroke,  further larger studies with gene–environment interactions  in diverse ethnicity should be conducted to clarify the asso‑ ciation between K469E polymorphism and ischemic stroke  susceptibility. Furthermore, the underlying molecular causal  pathways that confer susceptibility to ischemic stroke are  

warranted to be established to identify target for prevention  and treatment of ischemic stroke.
