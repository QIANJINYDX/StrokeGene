# Abstract  

Background— A fraction of coagulation factor VII circulates as an active protease (FVIIa).  FVIIa also circulates as an in activated complex with anti thro mb in (FVIIa-AT).  

Objective— Evaluate associations of FVIIa and FVIIa-AT with genome-wide single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) and incident coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and mortality.  

Patients/Methods— We measured FVIIa and FVIIa-AT in 3,486 Cardiovascular Health Study  (CHS) participants. We performed a genome-wide association scan for FVIIa and FVIIa-AT in  European-Americans   $(n{=}2,410)$   and examined associations of FVII phenotypes with incident  cardiovascular disease.  

Results— In European-Americans, the most significant SNP for FVIIa and FVIIa-AT was  rs1755685 in the  $F7$  promoter region on chromosome 13 (FVIIa:  $\upbeta{=-25.9\:\mathrm{mU/mL}}$   per minor  allele; FVIIa-AT:  $\upbeta\mathrm{=-26.6\,pM}$   per minor allele). Phenotypes were also associated with rs867186  located in PROCR on chromosome 20 (FVIIa:   $\upbeta\mathrm{=7.8\mU/mL}$   per minor allele; FVIIa-AT:  $\upbeta\!\!=9.9$    per minor allele). Adjusted for risk factors, a 1-standard deviation higher FVIIa was associated  with increased ischemic stroke risk (hazard ratio   $(\mathrm{HR})=1.12$  ;   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 

 1.23). Higher FVIIa-AT was associated with mortality from all-causes (HR: 1.08,  $95\%$   CI: 1.03, 

 1.12). Among European-American CHS participants the rs1755685 minor allele was associated  with lower ischemic stroke   $\mathrm{{HR}}{=}0.69$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.54, 0.88), but this association was not replicated  in a larger multi-cohort analysis.  

Conclusions— Results support the importance of the   $F7$  and PROCR loci on variation in  circulating FVIIa and FVIIa-AT. Findings suggest FVIIa is a risk factor for ischemic stroke in  older adults while higher FVIIa-AT may reflect mortality risk.

# Introduction  

Coagulation factor VII (FVII) is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen cleaved to the activated  serine protease FVIIa during hemostatic activation. A fraction  $(\sim\!1\!-\!2\%)$   of the total FVII  concentration circulates as FVIIa in human plasma and requires tissue factor (TF) for  pro teo ly tic activity [1]. FVIIa-TF initiates the extrinsic coagulation pathway by activating  coagulation factors IX and X leading to thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation.  

The FVIIa-TF complex is immediately in activated by tissue factor pathway inhibitor- (TFPI)  and anti thro mb in- (AT) dependent mechanisms. Inhibition by TFPI involves formation of a  TF-FVIIa-TFPI-FXa complex that remains bound to the cell surface and does not dissociate  into circulating blood [2]. AT binding to TF-FVIIa causes FVIIa dissociation and FVIIa-AT  complex formation. This complex is released into circulation and levels are strongly related  to FVIIa concentrations [3]. Emerging evidence from clinical studies have suggested FVIIaAT as a potential biomarker of hemostatic activation [3, 4].  

In epidemiological studies, evaluation of FVII has predominantly relied on FVII clotting  activity (FVIIc) measurements, which are influenced by levels of FVIIa and FVII antigen.  The Northwick Park Heart Study implicated FVIIc as a risk factor for fatal myocardial  infarction (MI) [5]. Prospective associations of FVIIc with coronary heart disease (CHD) or  stroke were inconsistent in subsequent population-based studies [6–11]. Inter-individual  differences in circulating FVIIa and FVIIa-AT levels are under-evaluated in prospective  studies and may be important for thrombotic risk [3].  

Several common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the   $F7$  gene are associated with  FVII antigen and activity levels [12, 13]. Well-studied  $F7$  polymorphisms, including the   $-323$   dec a nucleotide insertion (−323 ins10) (rs5742910) and R353Q mutation (rs6046) were  shown to be important for circulating FVIIa concentrations [14, 15]. A common  polymorphism in the protein C receptor gene (PROCR) (rs867186), encoding a serine to  glycine substitution (Ser219Gly) in endo the li al cell protein C receptor (EPCR), was  associated with higher FVIIa levels [16] and with increased risk of thrombosis [17]. Whether  polymorphisms associated with FVIIa influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk remains  uncertain [10, 18–22].  

To date, no epidemiological studies have evaluated genome-wide SNP associations with  FVIIa or FVIIa-AT, and very few prospective studies have assessed these coagulation  factors’ relationships with incident CVD. We evaluated associations of circulating FVIIa and  FVIIa-AT with CVD risk factors, genome-wide SNPs, incident CHD, ischemic stroke, and  mortality in older adults of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS).  

# Methods  

# Study Population  

The CHS is a prospective population-based cohort study of risk factors for CHD and stroke  in adults aged 65-years and older [23]. The original cohort of 5,201 men and women were  recruited in 1989-1990 from 4 U.S. field centers: Forsyth County, NC; Sacramento County,  CA; Washington County, MD; and Pittsburgh, PA. In 1992-93 (CHS Year 5), an additional  cohort of 687 primarily African-American (AA) participants were recruited. Participants  answered standardized questionnaires assessing CVD risk factors, lifestyle, and medical  histories [24]. The standardized clinical examination included fasting blood collection,  resting electrocardiograms (ECGs), duplex carotid ultra sonography ultrasound [25], and  echo car dio graphic examinations [26].  

Between 1990 and 1999, cohort follow-up occurred semi-annually, alternating between  clinical examinations and telephone contacts. Since 1999, potential events were identified by  two phone calls per year to participants. Relatives were asked to report all hospitalizations to  the CHS Field Center. All subjects gave written informed consent for participation in the  study and all procedures were conducted under institution ally approved protocols at each  center.  

# Laboratory Methods  

Citrated plasma from the 1992-93 CHS examination was used for evaluation of FVIIa and  FVIIa-AT (  $\scriptstyle{\mathit{n}}=3,486$  ). Technicians who completed centralized training programs collected  blood using standardized protocols [27]. Plasma was processed and aliquoted at room  temperature to limit the cold-activation of FVII [28] using standardized times for plasma  processing (  $\leq\!15$   minutes) and aliquot storage at  $-70^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   (  ${\le}10$   minutes) [27].  

FVIIa was measured using the Staclot VIIa-rTF assay run on a Stago STA-R Evolution  according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Diagnostic a Stago, Inc., Mount Olive, NJ);  inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV)   $8.7\%$  . The assay used recombinant soluble tissue  factor (rsTF), phospholipids, and  $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$   to initiate coagulation; rsTF retained FVIIa cofactor  function but was deficient in promoting activation of FVII to FVIIa [1, 29].  

FVIIa-AT was measured using the As sera ch rom VIIa-AT ELISA (Diagnostic a Stago, Inc.).  The assay captures FVIIa-AT with a mouse monoclonal anti-human FVIIa antibody and a  peroxidase-coupled monoclonal anti-AT antibody. The assay’s lower detection limit is 40  pM. Samples were run in duplicate   $(\mathbf{CV}\;8.0\%)$  ). FVIIa / FVIIa-AT assay standardization and  quality control were performed using controls provided with the assays and pooled normal  plasma samples (George King Bio-Medical, Inc., Overland Park, KS).  

Unless noted otherwise, biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation were measured at the  1992-93 CHS examination as previously described [27, 30, 31]. FVIIc was measured in  citrated plasma on a Coag-A-Mate X2 (Organon-Teknika, Durham, NC)   $(\mathrm{CV}\,5.9\%)$  ) [6]. The  coagulation inhibitor proteins, AT and TFPI, were measured at the CHS baseline  examination (1989-1990) by in-house assays among a randomly selected subgroup   $(n{=}400)$  )  without CVD [32]. Soluble EPCR (sEPCR) was measured among a subset of participants   $(m{=}577)$  ) at baseline using an in-house ELISA (CV  $3.1\%$  ) [33].  

# Genotyping  

Genotyping was performed using the Illumina 370CNV platform on 3,208 EuropeanAmerican (EA) participants at baseline (1989-90) who had available DNA samples and  provided informed consent for participation in DNA studies. Genotype data for 330,189  SNPs were used to impute to the 2.5 million SNPs from HapMap’s Phase 2 Centre d’Etude  du Polymorphism e Humain (CEU) reference samples using MaCH [34]. SNPs were not  included in the imputation target panel when   $\mathbf{R}^{2}$   values were   $<3$  , the minor allele frequency  (MAF) was   $\mathord{<\!0.5\%}$  , the missing rate across subjects  ${\tt>}5\%$  , or when the respective genotype  distribution significantly departed from expected Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium proportions   $(\mathsf{p}\!<1.0\!\times\!10^{-5})$  .  

# Event Ascertainment  

The primary clinical endpoints for this study were incident CVD events and mortality.  Events included adjudicated fatal or non-fatal MI, CHD (defined as MI, coronary artery  angioplasty or bypass grafting, or angina), and ischemic stroke. Mortality included from allcauses or from CVD, defined as adjudicated fatal events due to definite or probable MI,  CHD, or stroke. Incident events were reported at clinical visits or during semiannual  

telephone contacts by participants or proxies. Events were adjudicated by a physician review  panel using hospital and out-patient medical records, including when available copies of  ECGs, CT scans, MRI scans, death certificates, autopsy reports, and coroner reports [35– 37]. Censoring dates were defined as death, loss to follow-up, study drop out, or event date,  occurring through December 31, 2011. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure   ${>}140\;\mathrm{mmHg}$  , diastolic blood pressure  ${>}90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$  , or current use of anti hypertensive  medication. Diabetes was defined as the use of insulin, oral hypoglycemic medications, or a  fasting glucose level   ${\ge}126~\mathrm{mg/GL}$  .  

# Statistical Analysis  

Cross-sectional associations of FVIIa and FVIIa-AT with demographic variables and  cardiovascular-related biomarkers were evaluated using linear regression models adjusted  for age, sex, and race; models stratified by age, sex, or race were adjusted only for the 2  remaining variables. Models evaluating diabetes were adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking,  BMI, total-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. Models evaluating carotid artery  intima medial thickness (IMT) included these variables plus hypertension and systolic blood  pressure. FVII phenotypes were modeled as outcome variables with independent variables  modeled per standard deviation (SD) increment higher. Triglycerides, C-reactive protein  (CRP), and IMT phenotypes had non-normal distributions and were natural log-transformed.  To correct for multiple testing, results were considered significant if   $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.003$   (using a  Bonferonni correction for 20 tests). Pearson correlation was used to estimate associations  among FVII phenotypes, AT, and TFPI.  

We used linear regression models implemented in Mach2qtl [34] to test for genetic  associations between FVII phenotypes and imputed SNPs (  $\mathbf{\sigma}_{n=2,410}$   participants with  genotype and phenotype measures), with imputation data analyzed as continuous dosage  values (i.e., expected number of copies of the minor alleles). We adjusted for age, sex, and  the first two principal components (PCs) estimated using Eigensoft to control for global  ancestry [38]. The threshold for genome-wide statistical significance was set at  $5.0{\times}10^{-8}$  . To  assess for heterogeneity by disease status, we ran a sensitivity analysis evaluating SNP  relationships with FVII phenotypes stratified by CVD status (i.e., no prevalent CVD,  prevalent CHD, and prevalent stroke).  

Targeted conditional analyses in the   $F7$  and PROCR gene regions were performed to assess  whether multiple SNPs within these regions independently contributed to the signals. We  also assessed whether SNP associations were mediated by FVIIc, FVIIa, or sEPCR levels,  respectively, by including these phenotypes as covariates in linear regression models.  

Relationships between FVII phenotypes and incident CVD events and mortality were  evaluated using Cox proportional hazards ratios, modeled per SD increment higher FVII or  by tertiles of the distributions. To allow comparisons among the different FVII phenotypes,  only participants with measures of FVIIa, FVIIa-AT, and FVIIc were included in the  analyses   $\scriptstyle{\mathit{n}}=3,427$  ). We also performed a sensitivity analyses that included participants with  missing information for any one of the FVII phenotypes.  

Participants with adjudicated CVD at the 1992-93 examination were excluded from analyses  for the relevant outcome (  $\scriptstyle{m=382}$   participants with MI;  $\scriptstyle{n=762}$   with CHD; and,  $\scriptstyle{m=181}$   with  stroke). Incident hemorrhagic strokes   $(n{=}67)$  ) and strokes of unknown subtype   $(n{=}35)$  ) were  excluded from stroke analyses. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and race (demographic  model), with subsequent adjustment for LDL-cholesterol, smoking status, systolic blood  pressure, hypertension status, and diabetes status (risk factor model). Mortality analyses  included adjustment for prevalent MI, CHD, and stroke at the 1992-93 examination. We  evaluated genotype associations with incident ischemic stroke risk by including the most  significant  $F7$  or PROCR SNPs in risk factor-adjusted models.  

# Genetic Analyses in CHARGE  

A candidate SNP look-up for rs1755685 with stroke risk was assessed within 18  community-based prospective cohort studies, including CHS, participating in the Cohorts for  Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium [39, 40].  Analyses included 75,508 white participants free of stroke at baseline; expert committees in  the participating studies performed stroke adjudication and classification. We evaluated  associations with ischemic stroke type and card i oem boli c and non-card i oem boli c ischemic  stroke subtypes using Cox regression models with adjustment for age, sex, principal  components accounting for population stratification, and study site [40]. We had  ${\tt>}80\%$    power to detect an ischemic stroke HR of approximately 1.11 per copy of the rs1755685  minor allele with an alpha of 0.05.  

# Results  

# Cross-sectional associations of FVIIa and FVIIa-AT  

Characteristics of CHS participants with FVII measurements at the 1992-93 CHS clinical  examination are presented in Table S1. Mean FVIIa (SD) was   $52.7\;\mathrm{mU/mL}$     $(25.2\,\mathrm{mU/mL})$  );  mean FVIIa-AT (SD) was   $141.1\ \mathrm{pM}$     $(56.1~\mathrm{pmM})$  ). Both phenotypes were approximately  normally distributed (Fig S1). FVIIa was moderately correlated with FVIIa-AT (  $r^{2}{=}0.44)$    and FVIIc (  $(r^{2}{=}0.44)$  , and FVII-AT was less so with FVIIc   $r^{2}{=}0.26)$  . AT weakly correlated  with FVIIc   $(r^{2}{=}0.06)$   and FVIIa-AT (  $(r^{2}{=}0.03)$   but not FVIIa   $(r^{2}{=}0.01]$  ). FVII phenotypes  were not correlated with TFPI (Table S2).  

Table 1 presents age, sex, and race-adjusted associations of FVIIa and FVIIa-AT with CVD  risk factors and inflammation biomarkers. The correlates of FVIIc in CHS were previously  published [41]. Compared with men, women had significantly higher FVIIa (  $11.8\;\mathrm{mU/mL}$    higher) and FVIIa-AT (  $25.1\,\mathrm{pmM}$   higher) levels. Compared with AAs, EAs had significantly  higher FVIIa-AT (  $19.4\,\mathrm{pM}$   higher). Higher FVIIa was associated with moderately higher  systolic blood pressure, total and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, CRP, and platelet count.  Higher FVIIa-AT was strongly associated with current smoking and moderately associated  with higher systolic blood pressure, hypertension, total and HDL-cholesterol, CRP, common  carotid IMT, and lower BMI (Table 2).  

# Genome-wide associations of FVIIa and FVIIa-AT in European-Americans  

In a GWAS of FVIIa performed among 2,391 EAs, 2 regions, located on chromosomes 13  and 20, reached genome-wide significance   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!5\!\!\times\!\!10^{-8})$   (Table 2). On chromosome 13, 35  SNPs located within the F7/F10 and MCF2L (MCF.2 cell line derived transforming  sequence-like) loci exceeded significance (Table 2; Figure 1A). The most significant  genome-wide SNP was rs1755685   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!1.2\!\times\!\!10^{-122})$  ) located within the   $5^{\prime}$    flanking/promoter  region of  $F7.$   Each copy of the rs1755685 minor allele   $\mathrm{MAF}{=}0.12)$  ) was associated with   $25.9\,\mathrm{muU}/\mathrm{mL}$   (standard error   $\mathrm{(SE)}=1.2\;\mathrm{mU/mL}$  ) lower FVIIa.  

On chromosome 20, 29 SNPs attained genome-wide significance (Table 2; Figure 1B). The  most significant SNP was rs867186   $(\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!6.6\!\times\!\!10^{-12})$  ) located in exon 4 of the PROCR gene.  Each minor allele copy of rs867186   $\mathrm{MAF}{=}0.096$  ) was associated with   $7.8\;\mathrm{mU/mL}$     $\mathrm{SE}{=1.1}$   $\mathrm{{mU/mL}}$  ) higher FVIIa. SNPs located near 3 additional genes on chromosome 20 also  reached genome-wide significance: EDEM2 (endoplasmic reticulum degradation-enhancing  alpha-mannos ida se-like 2); MYH7B (myosin heavy chain 7B, cardiac muscle, beta); and,   $T R P C4A P$  (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 4 associated  protein). These SNPs were in strong linkage d is equilibrium (LD) with rs867186 [13].  

In the FVIIa-AT GWAS   $(m{=}2{,}410\,\mathrm{EAs})$  ), signals on chromosomes 13 and 20 again exceeded  genome-wide significance (Table 2). The strongest signal was also rs1755685   $\upbeta\!\!=\!-26.6$    pM,  $\mathrm{SE}{=}1.7$  ;  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!6.2\!\times\!\!10^{-55}.$  ) in the   $F7$  locus. The signal on chromosome 13 encompassed 24  additional SNPs located within the  $F7\!/F1O$  and MCF2L loci (Figure 1C). On chromosome  20, 9 SNPs located within the PROCR and   $E D E M2$  genes exceeded significance; the most  significant association was again rs867186 (  $\mathrm{\upbeta}\mathrm{=}\,9.9\:\mathrm{pM}$  ,   $\mathrm{SE}{=}1.7$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!4.7\!\times\!\!10^{-9}\!\!)$  ) in PROCR  (Figure 1D). SNP associations with both FVII phenotypes were essentially the same when  stratified by prevalent CVD status.  

Genome-wide significance for associations between FVIIc and variants in the  $F7$  locus (lead  variant rs488703) were previously reported by the CHARGE Consortium (which includes  CHS) [13]. We assessed associations of rs1755685 and rs867186 with FVIIc. Each copy of  the rs1755685 minor allele was associated with an estimated  $20.9\%$     $\mathrm{(SE=1.3\%}$  ;  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!6.7$     $\times10^{-56})$   lower FVIIc, and each minor allele copy of rs867186 was associated with an  estimated  $9.9\%$   (  $\mathrm{SE}{=}\,1.3\%$  ;  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!4.9\times\!\!10^{-14}\!\!\!$  ) higher FVIIc.  

# Conditional genetic analysis  

We performed an iterative, forward-selection analysis that conditioned on the top  $F7$  (rs1755685) and PROCR (rs867186) SNPs. In FVIIa analyses, no SNPs reached genomewide significance on chromosome 13 after conditioning on rs1755685 (Figure 2A), although  nominal evidence for association with rs555212 remained   $\scriptstyle(\mathfrak{p}=1.7\times10^{-5})$  ). After conditioning  on rs867186, no additional SNPs on chromosome 20 remained significantly associated with  FVIIa (Figure 2B). Together, these 2 SNPs explained  $24.2\%$   of the variance in FVIIa levels  (rs1755685,  $r^{2}{=}0.220$  ; rs867186,  $r^{2}{=}0.022)$  ). Similarly, no additional SNPs remained  significantly associated with FVIIa-AT after conditioning on rs1755685 or rs867186 (Figure  2C & D). Rs1755685 explained  $7.2\%$   of the variance in FVIIa-AT and rs867186 explained   $1.3\%$   of the variance.  

We evaluated whether relationships between rs1755685 or rs867186 and FVIIa were  mediated by FVIIc or sEPCR levels, respectively, by adding these phenotypes as covariates  in linear regression models that included age, sex, clinical site, and rs1755685 or rs867186.  With FVIIc in the model the association of rs1755685 with FVIIa was moderately attenuated   $(\upbeta{=}\,{-}15.8\mathrm{\mU/mL}$  ;  $\mathsf{p{=}8.5{\times}10^{-59}}$  ). In participants with sEPCR measured   $\scriptstyle{\left(m=577\right)}$  ),  adjustment completely attenuated the association of rs867186 with FVIIa (without sEPCR  adjustment:   $\upbeta{=}8.7\:\mathrm{muU/mL}$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!5.0\!\!\times\!\!10^{-5}$  ; with sEPCR adjustment:  $\upbeta{=}1.3\;\mathrm{muU/mL}$  ,  $\mathtt{p=0.54})$  ).  We also assessed whether associations of rs1755685 with FVIIa-AT were mediated by  FVIIa. In models adjusted for age, sex, clinical site, and FVIIa, the association between  rs1755685 and FVIIa-AT was attenuated (  $\upbeta{=}3.7$   (  $\mathrm{SE}{=}2.2\$  ),  $\tt p{=}0.10$  ).  

# Relationships of FVII phenotypes with incident CVD events and mortality  

Among the 3,427 CHS participants with measures of FVIIa, FVIIa-AT, and FVIIc at the  1992-93 CHS clinical examination, incident events comprised 576 MIs, 945 CHD events,  and 470 ischemic strokes over a maximum possible 19.5-years of follow-up (median 11.5  years). Of the 2,035 deaths over this period from all-causes, 1,027 were attributed to  cardiovascular causes. The relationships between FVII phenotypes, modeled per SD units,  with events are shown in Table 3. Table S3 presents associations with CVD events stratified  by FVII tertiles.  

In demographic-adjusted models, higher FVIIa and FVIIa-AT were each associated with  increased ischemic stroke risk. After adjustment for CVD risk factors, FVIIa remained  associated with ischemic stroke (hazard ratio (HR): 1.12,  $95\%$   confidence interval (CI): 

 1.01, 1.23) and results for FVIIa-AT were slightly attenuated (HR: 1.09,  $95\%$   CI: 0.99, 

 1.19). FVIIa-AT was associated with cardiovascular- and all-cause-mortality in  demographic-adjusted models. After adjustment for other risk factors, evidence for  association with CVD-mortality was no longer observed while results for all-cause mortality  were essentially unchanged (HR: 1.08,  $95\%$   CI: 1.03, 1.12). FVIIc was not associated with  incident events or mortality (Table 3). In sensitivity analyses that evaluated participants with  measurements for any one of the FVII phenotypes (  $\it{m=3,486}$   for FVIIa and FVIIa-AT and   $\it{n}\!\!=\!\!4,\!669$   for FVIIc) results were similar.  

# SNP associations with ischemic stroke  

Among EA CHS participants   $(n{=}2,794)$  ), each additional copy of the rs1755685 minor allele  was associated with a decrease in the estimated ischemic stroke HR of 0.69 (  $95\%$   CI: 0.54,  0.88) in risk-factor-adjusted models. With the inclusion of FVIIa in the model   $\scriptstyle{n=2,079}$  ), the  relationship was attenuated towards the null   $\mathrm{{HR}}{=}0.73$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.53, 1.02). Relationships  were more robust to inclusion of FVIIa-AT in the model in place of FVIIa (  $\mathrm{{HR}}{=}0.70$  ,  $95\%$    CI: 0.51, 0.96). The rs867186 genotype was not associated with ischemic stroke   $(\mathrm{{HR}}{=}0.99\$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.79, 1.23).  

We performed a candidate SNP look-up in CHARGE [40]. Among 66,023 white participants  with 2,842 ischemic stroke events, rs1755685 was not associated with ischemic stroke type   $\upbeta\!\!=\!-0.018$  ;  $\mathrm{SE=}0.04$  ;  $\mathrm{\p{=}0.67]}$  ) or card i oem boli c (  $_{n}$  total= 47,075; n event= 537) (  $(\upbeta\!\!=0.12$  ;  

$\mathrm{SE=}0.09$  ;  $\tt p{=}0.19$  ) and non-card i oem boli c (n total= 55,070; n event  $=$   1,735)   $(\upbeta\mathrm{=-0.016}$  ; 

  $\mathrm{SE=}0.05$  ;  $\mathrm{{p}{=}0.76}$  ) ischemic stroke subtypes.  

# Discussion  

In a prospective cohort of older adults, we identified associations of higher FVIIa with  increased risk of incident ischemic stroke and relationships of higher FVIIa-AT with  mortality from all-causes. We also confirmed the importance of the  $F7$  and PROCR loci on  variation in FVIIa levels.  

# Associations of FVII with CVD events and mortality  

In epidemiological studies, FVII has predominantly been evaluated by FVIIc assays and  relationships with incident CHD or ischemic stroke have been inconsistent [5, 6, 8–10, 42,  43]. FVIIc assays are influenced by levels of both FVII antigen and FVIIa, as highlighted in  our correlation analysis whereby FVIIa explained approximately half of the variation in  FVIIc. FVIIc assay sensitivity to FVIIa is variable, influenced by the source of  th rom bop last in and presence or absence of plasma protein C [44].  

Our study is among only a few to evaluate circulating FVIIa or FVIIa-AT with incident CVD  events [45, 46]. We did not observe relationships of FVIIa or FVIIa-AT with MI or CHD,  consistent with several reports [6, 9, 19, 47], but not all [21, 48, 49], for FVIIc or   $F7\,\mathrm{{SNPS}}$  .  In contrast, we identified associations of higher FVIIa, but not FVIIc, with ischemic stroke  after adjustment for risk factors. These results suggest FVIIa may be a more sensitive risk  marker of ischemic stroke compared with FVIIc; the FVIIa and FVIIa-AT HRs and CIs for  ischemic stroke were similar indicating similar sensitivity of the assays. An earlier study in  CHS [10] reported higher FVIIc measured at the baseline examination (1989-90) was  associated with increased ischemic stroke risk. Differences in follow-up times, or fewer  FVIIc measurements available at the 1992-1993 CHS examination, may account for these  differences.  

The minor allele of rs1755685, associated with lower FVII levels, was associated with lower  ischemic stroke risk in our study, and these associations were partly mediated by FVIIa and  its correlated phenotype FVIIa-AT. Previous results in CHS demonstrated associations of  rs6046, in strong LD with rs1755685, with lower ischemic stroke risk, consistent with our  results [10]. Our analyses in the CHARGE Consortium, however, showed rs1755685 was  not associated with the ischemic stroke type or its subtypes. This suggests relationship  between FVIIa and stroke may not be causal or rs1755685 has only a small effect size.  Several other studies also reported null associations of  $F7$  polymorphisms with stroke  (summarized in Table S4). CHARGE represents several heterogeneous cohorts whose  susceptibility towards stroke risk may vary depending on the influence of additional factors,  such as age [50]. Collectively, our results, along with prior findings in CHS [10], suggest the  importance of FVII as a risk factor for ischemic stroke among older adults.  

FVIIa-AT complexes may be a biomarker of activated coagulation [4] and may reflect  vascular injury or underlying chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis [51].  Our results identified associations of FVIIa-AT with mortality attributed to all-causes.  

Findings were consistent with previous studies reporting higher FVIIa-AT levels predicted  total- and cardiovascular-mortality in patients with clinically stable CAD [51] but not  incident cardiovascular events [46].  

# Genetic associations of FVIIa and FVIIa-AT  

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate genome-wide associations of  FVIIa or FVIIa-AT. Our results confirmed the importance of the  $F7$  and PROCR loci on  variation in FVII levels [13–16, 52, 53]. The strongest association for both FVIIa and FVIIaAT was with rs1755685 located within the  $5^{\prime}$    flanking / promoter region of  $F7.$  These  findings are consistent with a previous study reporting independent associations of  rs1755685 with FVIIc [20]. Associations of rs1755685 with FVIIa-AT are consistent with  the importance of FVIIa levels on FVIIa-AT [3]. After iterative conditional analyses, no  additional SNPs in the chromosome  $13\;F7$  locus remained significantly associated with  either FVII phenotype.  

Several known  $F7$  promoter variants are in strong LD in European-ancestry populations, and  whether rs1755685 plays a functional role is unclear. An in vitro site-directed mutagen es is  study demonstrated allelic variants in rs1755685 increased  $F7$  gene expression, but these  effects were offset by the   $-323\mathrm{ins}10$   polymorphisms in LD with rs1755685 [54]. This study  suggested  $-323\mathrm{ins}10$   was the major haplotype variant responsible for lower FVII levels in a  Spanish population [54]. The   $-323\mathrm{ins}10$   variant is also in strong LD with the R353Q  polymorphisms [12]. Whether the effects of R353Q are due to  $-323\mathrm{ins}10$   are controversial  [55, 56]. The minor allele of the R353Q variant was associated with statistically significantly  lower levels of FVIIa and FVIIa-AT in our study, with effect sizes comparable to rs1755685,  but these associations were no longer significant after conditioning on rs1755685. We did  not have information for   $-323\mathrm{ins}10$  .  

The rs867186 (Ser219Gly) polymorphism tags a common PROCR haplotype and is  associated with higher sEPCR levels [17]. Approximately  $70\%$   of the variance in sEPCR  levels are explained by the Ser219Gly mutation and increased EPCR shedding has been  confirmed in carriers of the Gly allele [16, 57]. Associations of rs867186 with higher FVIIa,  FVIIc, FVIIag and other coagulation biomarkers were reported previously [16] and EPCRdependent endocytosis was proposed as a FVII clearance mechanism [58]. Our results did  not indicate a role for rs867186 with ischemic stroke, consistent with previous results in  CHS [33].  

# Physiological correlates of FVIIa and FVIIa-AT  

Consistent with known relationships of FVII with hormonal status [59], FVIIa and FVIIa-AT  were significantly higher among post-menopausal women than men. Modest relationships  between lipids and FVIIa in our study and others [47, 59] suggest plasma lipid levels are  more closely related to FVII protein production than activation. Our results showed the  strongest correlate of FVIIa-AT was FVIIa, confirming previous findings [3, 51]. Crosssectional relationships of higher FVIIa-AT with CRP, smoking status, and common carotid  IMT are consistent with interactions between inflammatory pathways and TF expression /  exposure.  

# Limitations and conclusions  

Our study was limited by sample availability which precluded FVII measurements in the  entire cohort and restricted power. Our genetic analyses were limited to EAs and a previous  study demonstrated lower LD and greater haplotype diversity for FVII-associated SNPs  among AAs compared with EAs [52]. We only evaluated common SNPs; rare and lowfrequency variants were also associated with FVII [53]. FVII measurements were performed  among a cohort of older adults and relationships of FVII phenotypes, or associated SNPs,  with stroke may differ among younger populations. Although these FVII assays may be  useful in evaluating hemostatic activation, their clinical utility is currently unclear.  

In conclusion, our results support the importance of   $F7$  and PROCR SNPs on variation in  circulating FVIIa and FVIIa-AT. Findings suggest higher FVIIa is a risk factor for ischemic  stroke in older adults while FVIIa-AT may reflect mortality risk.

FVIIa and FVIIa-AT regional association plots for chromosome 13 and chromosome 20 in  European-Americans. FVIIa (A & B) and FVIIa-AT (C & D) regional association plots for  the chromosome 13q34 (A & C) and chromosome 20q11.2 (B & D) loci are presented. The  colors of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) indicate pairwise linkage  d is equilibrium (LD) relative to the lead SNP in the region. SNPs with missing LD  information are shown in gray. LD was based on r-squared values calculated using 1000  Genomes (March 2012 EUR) LD for European-Americans. Plots were generated using  LocusZoom [60].

Associations between FVII phenotypes and biomarkers were estimated in separate linear regression models with FVII as the outcome variable,  adjusted for age, sex, and race. Independent variables were modeled per 1-SD increase (values shown in parenthesis);  $\upbeta$  -coefficients (standard  errors) and  $\mathfrak{p}$  -values are presented. Triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), and intima medial thickness (IMT) phenotypes were natural logtransformed. In models of age, sex, and race, the estimates were adjusted only for the 2 remaining variables.  

Diabetes models were adjusted for age, sex, race, smoking, BMI, total-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Analyses using Cox proportional hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) modeled per 1-SD higher FVII phenotype value among participants with each of the FVII phenotypes measured  (n=3,427). Demographic Model: Age, sex, and race. Risk Factor Model: Age, sex, race, smoking status, diabetes status, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol; mortality models also included adjustment for prevalent MI, CHD, and stroke  at the 1992-93 CHS examination. CHD, coronary heart disease; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; MI, myocardial infarction.
