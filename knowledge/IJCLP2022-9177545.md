Objectives . Te collateral circulation near the cerebral artery occlusion can contribute to the relief of the symptoms and signs of stroke. Genetic factors play a decisive role in the diﬀerence in collateral circulation. Survivin, encoded by the b acul o viral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat-containing 5 gene (BIRC5), plays an important role in maintaining long-term endo the li al integrity and homeostasis and as an angiogenic factor in the treatment of vascular diseases. We hypothesized that genetic variations in the BIRC5 gene may contribute to severity by inﬂuencing the collateral circulation. Tis study aimed at examining how the polymorphism of the BIRC5 gene correlated with the collateral circulation and severity of large artery at hero sclerotic stroke. Methods . Tis study enrolled 428 patients with large artery at hero sclerotic stroke. Tere are no statistical diﬀerences in age, sex, social behavior, such as smoking and drinking, between the groups classiﬁed by the collateral circulation and by the severity of stroke   $\left(P>0.01\right)$  ). Direct sequencing was performed for the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of BIRC5 (rs2071214). Te enrolled patients were divided into several subgroups based on the collateral ﬂow grading system from the American Society of Interventional and Terapeutic Neuro radiology/Society of Interventional Radiology (ASITN/SIR), the results of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Survey (NIHSS) (6 as a threshold), and the score of the modiﬁed Rankin scale (mRS) (for the prediction of prognosis, 2 as a threshold). Diﬀerences among subgroups were identiﬁed through logistic regression. Results . Te analysis of collateral circulation revealed the signiﬁcant correlation of SNP of rs2071214 with the development of poor collateral circulation of large artery at hero sclerotic stroke in the additive model (GG vs. AA, odds ratio   $\mathrm{(OR)}=3.592$  ,   $95\%$  conﬁdence interval   $(\mathrm{CI})=1.410–9.150$  , and    $P=0.007.$  ) and the recessive model (GG vs. AA/GA,   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,3.313$  ,   $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=1.420–7.727$  , and  $P=0.006)$  ). Te analysis of stroke severity exp le of  f rs2071214 in increasing stroke severity in the dominant model (GA/GG vs. AA,  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.658$   $95\%\operatorname{CI}=1.017{-}2.703$     1.017–2.703, and  $P=0.043$    043) and the additive model (GA vs. AA,   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.717$  ,  $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}=1.021{-}2.888$  , and    $P=0.042$  ). However, the analysis of the short-te me indicated that three genetic models were not associated with short-term  in the additive model (GA vs. AA,  $P=0.815$    815, GG vs. AA, and  $P=0.336)$  ), the dominant model (GA/GG vs. AA and  $P=0.589)$    589), and the recessive model (GG vs. AA/GA and    $P=0.342)$  ). Conclusion . Our ﬁndings identiﬁed the SNP of rs2071214 of the BIRC5 gene as a risk factor for the poor compensatory ability of collateral circulation and a predictor of stroke severity in large artery at hero sclerotic stroke, which suggested that the SNP of rs2071214 can serve as an innovative therapeutic target for patients with acute ischemic stroke.  

# 1. Introduction  

Stroke has caused the most deaths in China and contributed a lot to adult disability in recent years [1]. It not only reduces patients’ life quality but also increases the burden on the family and society. Ischemic stroke is the main subtype of stroke with a proportion of over  $80\%$  . Its major risk factor is intra cranial at hero sclerotic stenosis or extra cranial carotid stenosis [2]. However, no signiﬁcant correlation between artery stenosis size and stroke severity in some cases of stroke has been found [3]. Our previous research concluded that the condition of collateral circulation aﬀected the severity of clinical symptoms and signs of stroke [4]. Compared to patients with poor collateral circulation, those with good collateral circulation usually presented better results in response to therapy and stroke severity, as well as better clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke [5]. Terefore, further research of the factors that aﬀect the collateral circulation of ischemic stroke is of great sign i can ce.  

Te vascular endo the li al cells (VECs) play a role in regulating vascular permeability, vascular tone, and blood ﬂow [6]. Its mechanisms include forming new blood vessels by proliferating, migrating, di e rent i a ting, and maintaining micro vascular integrity and blood ﬂow via anti-inﬂammatory, anti thr ombo tic, and va so dilatory activities [7, 8]. Nonetheless, mature VECs are limited by such defects as low activity, slow growth, and renewal. Survivin, encoded by the BIRC5 gene, has the lowest molecular weight in the IAP protein family [9]. It is involved in protecting the cells by inhibiting apoptosis, regulating cell mitosis, and adapting cells to an unfavorable environment [10]. As found from a mouse model, the BIRC5 gene-trans fec ted cells presented signiﬁcant increases in the expression of cell cycle proteins, mRNA and protein expressions of survivin, cell proliferation, and invasive ness and migration activities [11]. Previous literature identiﬁes the lack of VECs survivin as a cause of embryonic defects in ang io genesis, car diogenes is, and neural tube closure [12]. As found from  in vivo  and  in vitro  experiments, survivin has pleiotropic eﬀects, including enhancing cell viability and migratory capability, reducing apoptosis, and stimulating ang io genesis [13]. Moreover, the total in activation of the BIRC5 gene was found to result in early embryonic lethality in the mouse model [13, 14]. Tese studies indicate the possible correlation of BIRC5 gene mutations with the integrity and homeostasis of collateral circulation.  

Te correlation between the SNP of BIRC5 rs2071214 and susceptibility to ischemic stroke was reported previously [15]. Te close correlation of collateral circulation with the susceptibility and severity of an ischemic stroke is worth exploring in terms of its clinical sign i can ce. Nevertheless, whether the relationship of the SNP of rs2071214 with collateral circulation and severity is eﬀective among ischemic stroke patients remains unclear. Herein, the potential association of the allelic variation of BIRC5 rs2071214 with the collateral circulation and severity of patients with ischemic stroke was explored deeply to examine the possible mechanism.  

# 2. Materials and Methods  

2.1. Study Subjects.  Herein, 428 patients of acute ischemic stroke, who had disease onset from January 2019 to May 2021, were collected from the Neurology Department of the aﬃliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nation ali ties. Te patients enrolled met the following criteria: (1) meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic standard of acute ischemic stroke; (2) suﬀering from the ﬁrst-onset cerebral infarction within 7 days; (3) receiving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to detect new lesions; (4) having digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination results that showed the occlusion or severe stenosis of the common, internal, or middle cerebral artery, i.e., the responsible vessel; (5) aged between 50 years and 80 years; (6) providing consent to take part in this clinical research; (7) having the large artery-involved ischemic stroke as the cerebral infarction subtype according to the cerebral infarction class i cation of the Trial of   $\mathrm{Arg}\,10172$   in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) [16]. No patients enrolled died in this study. Patients were excluded because of the following criteria: (1) 16 patients being diagnosed with car dio geni c cerebral embolism; (2) 21 patients suﬀering from intra cranial hemorrhage, transient cerebral ischemia, and cerebral embolism of vasculitis; (3) 17 patients having nervous system damage that was not caused by acute cerebral infarction; (4) 26 patients having inherited metabolic disease or hereditary neuro degenerative disease; (5) 3 patients being diagnosed with serious diseases, such as a malignant tumor, abnormal liver function, severe infection, or autoimmune disorder. Te whole study was summarized in the supplementary ﬁgure. Tis study was compiled following the relevant regulations of the Ethics Committee established by the aﬃliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities.  

2.2. Clinical Data Collection.  Te basic data of all enrolled participants were collected, including (1) demographics, such as age, sex, height, and body mass index; (2) the medical   history, including hypertension history (diastolic pressure  ${\geq}90\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   or systolic pressure  ${\geq}140\,\mathrm{mmHg}$   measured more than 3 times during hospital iz a tio or an existing treatment   ≥ by anti hypertensive drugs), diabetes mellitus history (ran glucose  $\geq\!11.1\,\mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{l}$  , fasting bl lucose 7.0 mmol/l, or the use of anti diabetic drugs for treatment), smoking/drinking history (over 10 cigarettes/50 ml of alcohol per day for ﬁve consecutive years); (3) family history of cerebro vascular disease; (4) the NIHSS score on admission     (minor and moderate-to-severe stroke deﬁned by the NIHSS score of  ${<}6$   and  $\geq\,6.$  , respectively); (5) the mRS score 3 months after the stroke onset (patients with   $\mathrm{mRS}\leq2$   > deﬁned as favorable outcomes, and patients with mRS  $\mathrm{mRS}>2$  were deﬁned as unfavorable outcomes) [17].  

2.3. Biochemical Examination.  From the elbow vein of fasting patients in the second morning after admission, peripheral blood was collected for diagnosis. Te residual blood will be processed for DNA isolation and sequencing. Te related biochemical indicators were examined to obtain the concentrations of triglyceride, apo lipoprotein B/A1, cholesterol, very low-/low-/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and homo cyst eine.  

2.4. Detection of Survivin Level.  Serum was stored at    $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  till testing. Te content of survivin in the sample was detected by ELISA. Te recombinant survivin in the kit (purchased from Shanghai Xitang Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) was diluted   $(4000{\sim}62.5\,\mathrm{ng/L})$  , and the standard curve was used to calculate the content of survivin in the sample. All procedures were performed strictly according to manufacturers’ instructions.  

2.5. Cerebral Collateral Circulation Was Evaluated by DSA. Within 7days of onset, the whole of cerebral vessels was detected by DSA, and the endo vascular procedure was performed by experienced interventional neurologists. Two experienced neurologists judged the results of the angiography with disagreements resolved by a third neurologist. Te WarfarinAspirin Symptomatic Intra cranial Disease (WASID) method was applied to the estimation of the intra cranial arterial stenosis level [18]. Te North American Symptomatic Carotid End art erect o my Trial (NASCET) standard was applied to the   estimation of the extra cranial arterial stenosis level [19]. Te stenosis degree  ${\geq}70\%$   indicated severe stenosis or occlusion. Te collateral ﬂow grading system from the ASITN/SIR was adopted for assessing collateral circulation class i cation [20]. Patients with grades 0 to 2 and 3 to 4 were classiﬁed into two collateral circulation groups, poor, and good, respectively. Te whole process was double-blinded.  

2.6. SNP Selection and Genotyping.  From the NCBI SNP database and previous studies on the relationship between the BIRC5  gene and ischemic stroke, the SNP of rs2071214 was selected. Following the operation manual, we extracted the total DNA from the leukocytes from the peripheral venous blood by the Tiangen DNA kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). Te target DNA fragment was ampliﬁed using the PCR technique. Electrophoresis was conducted to conﬁrm PCR products. Genotyping was completed by direct sequencing of Shanghai Tianhao biotechnology company (Shanghai, China). For quality control, a random   $5\%$   of the sample was selected for repeat genotyping, which presented completely consistent results.  

2.7. Statistical Analysis.  We used the SPSS 21.0 software

 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) for statistical analyses. Medians (quartiles) and mean  $\pm$   standard deviation (SD) were used to express continuous variables. Two-group comparisons were performed by Mann–Whitney test or student’s    $t.$  - test after Gaussian distribution testing. Te percentage   $(\%)$  was used as an expression of categorical variables. A proportion comparison was performed using the Chi-square test. With the use of OR and   $95\%$   CI, we performed multivariate logistic regression analysis and estimated the association of genotypes with AIS collateral circulation, severity, and shortterm outcome, and the relevant indicators were adjusted. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the diﬀerences among   three groups, followed by the LSD test. Statistical sign i can ce was embodied in the    $P$  -value  ${<}0.05$  .  

# 3. Results  

3.1. Distribution of the Intra cranial and Extra cranial Vascular   Stenosis.  DSA examination conﬁrmed the degree of vascular stenosis at  ${\geq}70\%$  ng all patients. Te proportions of MCA stenosis (41.76%) were the most frequent type, and the CCA stenosis (6.50%) was the least one. EC-ICA stenosis and IC-ICA stenosis occupied about   $30\%$   and   $20\%$  , respectively. Details are in Table 1.  

3.2. Correlation between Collateral Circulation and Stenosis. Here, 428 patients were divided by the result of DSA examination into two collateral circulation groups, namely poor (250,   $58.41\%$  ) and good (178,   $41.59\%$  ), according to the ASITN/SIR collateral ﬂow grading system. A larger proportion of patients with occluded blood vessels were in the good group (162,   $91.01\%.$  ), compared with the poor group

 ≤  $(38{,}15.20\%)$    . In addition, in contrast to the poor group (212,

  $84.80\%)$  , the good group has much fewer patients with   $70\%$  Stenosis  ${<}100\%$   (16,   $8.99\%$  ) rt  ≤ scular stenosis was sign i cant ly diﬀerent among the good and poor collateral circulation groups (  $(\chi^{2}\!=\!240.{\overset{\cdot}{05}}2$      P  $P\!\le\!0.001\big)$  001). Te speciﬁc information is shown in Table 2.  

3.3. Comparison of Survivin Level.  According to the BIRC5 SNP of rs2071214 sequencing results, 428 patients were divided into an AA genotype group (155,   $36.21\%$  ), a GA genotype group (200,   $46.73\%$  ), and a GG genotype group

 (73,   $17.06\%$   ± ). Tere was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in survivin  ±  the AA group   $(57.06\pm8.61)$   

  $(55.81\pm9.12)$   9.12), and the GG group (56.23  $(56.23\pm9.58)$   9.58) (  $\dot{F}\!=\!0.842$     $P=0.423)$    423), as shown in Figure 1.  

3.4. Association between BIRC5 SNP of rs2071214 and the Capacity of Collateral Circulation.  Te basic information of patients in the two groups is shown in Table 3. Compared with the good collateral circulation group, the poor group had a lower proportion of patients with hypertension  ≤

  $(64.40\%$   vs.   $76.40\%$  ,    $P=0.008)$  and a higher HDL-C

 (  $\phantom{-}1.11\pm0.29$   vs.   $0.99\pm0.31$  ,  $P\le0.001$  001). Table 4 illustrates the association between the BIRC5 SNP of rs2071214 and the capacity of collateral circulation. As found by multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, HDL-C, and vascular stenosis degree, the GG

Te association between the BIRC5 SNP of rs2071214 and stroke severity is shown in Table 6. From the multivariate logistic regression analysis after the adjustment for age, smoking, HDL-C, collateral circulation, and vascular stenosis degree, we found the correlation of rs2071214 mutation with a higher risk of stroke severity (additive A vs. AA,   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.717$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=1.021–2.888,$   $P=0.042$   mod  vs. AA, OR  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.658,$    95% CI    1.017–2.703, and  $P=0.043$    043) (Table 6).  

3.6. Association between BIRC5 SNP of rs2071214 and ShortTerm Outcome.  Te baseline characteristics of 428 patients grouped by mRS are shown in Table 7. Of these patients, 176 patients   $(41.12\%)$   achieved a favorable outcome (mRS of 0–2). Compared with the patients with a favorable outcome, the patients with an unfavorable outcome (mRS of 3–6) had ±  ± a higher HDL-C  $(1.09\pm0.32$   vs.  $1.03\pm0.29$   and  $P=0.049)$   ≥ -  $'2.93\pm0.98$   $2.65\pm0.98$   ≤  $P=0.004\$    004), and a higher proportion of patients with severe stroke  $(\mathrm{NHSS}\geq6)$  6) (68.65% vs.38.80%, and  $P\!\le\!0.001\!,$  001). Te genotypes of BIRC5 SNP of rs2071214 and their association with the short-term outcome are shown in Table 8. From the multivariate logistic regression analysis after the adjustment for HDL-C, LDL-C, and NIHSS scores, we found three genotypes were not associated with the short-term outcome (additive model: GA vs. AA,    $P=0.815$  , GG vs. A  $P=$  0 . 336 ; dominant model: GA/GG vs  P  $P=0.589$    recessive model: GG vs. AA/GA and  $P=0.342$    342) (Table 8).  

# 4. Discussion  

Te collateral circulation near the cerebral artery occlusion plays a major role in reducing ischemia in the penumbra area [21]. Te blood ﬂow redistribution capacity of the collateral circulation is determined by the number and diameter of native collateral s [22]. Recent studies have conﬁrmed the determinant role of genetic factors in the diﬀerence of native collateral circulation among mice samples [23]. Herein, a sign i cant ly higher percentage of patients with GG genotype was found from the poor collateral circulation group than in the good group. It reveals that for the poor compensatory collateral circulation, the BIRC5 SNP of rs2071214 is a risk factor. Moreover, compared with the patients with   $\mathrm{NHSS}\geq6.$   the patients with a GG genotype had a sign i cant ly higher percentage, suggesting that the BIRC5 GG genotype of rs2071214 was negatively correlated with stroke severity. In other words, it could predict the stroke severity of patients with acute ischemic stroke.  

VECs regulate leukocyte traﬃcking, blood coagulationbri no ly tic system, and vascular tone, thereby preventing vascular disorders and maintaining vascular homeostasis [24]. VEC damage and in amma tion are more likely to increase vascular permeability and disrupt vascular integrity. Te development of collateral circulation is found by previous literature to correlate with the complex physiological process of VECs. Nonetheless, mature VECs are subject to the defects of low activity, slow growth, and slow renewal under pathological conditions. A key factor in ang io genesis is the persistence of VECs viability, a complex pathophysiological process covering specialized anti a pop to tic genes’ expressions and cell mitosis regulation [25]. Cell mitosis is a complex cell cycle, transiting cell cycle-related proteins from the G0/G1, S phase to the G2-M phase. Its regulation is achieved by a complex network of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), promoting cell cycle progression by formation and activation [26]. Apoptosis means cells’ spontaneous and orderly death under the control of genes, which was induced by the activation of cysteine proteases. Studies have demonstrated the necessity of preventing VECs apoptosis and promoting VECs migration and invasion for ang io genesis [27]. Terefore, how to endow VECs with anti apoptosis and promote proliferation and easy migration becomes the key challenge to maintain good collateral circulation.  

Recently, the importance of survivin in vascular endothelial biology has been demonstrated. During the metaphase and anaphase of mitosis, survivin regulates the aggregation and movement of spindle microtubules and

cytokinesis [28, 29]. Some studies conﬁrmed the partici- pation of survivin in the progression of the cell cycle from the ﬁnding that the expression of survivin increased in the G1 phase and reached the peak in the G2/M phase [30]. In the BIRC5 gene-trans fec ted cells, the sign i cant ly increased expressions of survivin at mRNA and protein levels, signiﬁcantly reduced apoptotic cells, down regulated expressions of cleaved-caspases 8, 3, and 9, and the cell viability and proliferation promoted by survivin overexpression were identiﬁed [11]. In addition, the increased migrating and invasive cells and the up regulated expressions of MMP-2, -7, and -9 in the BIRC5 gene-trans fec ted cells at a signiﬁcant level suggested that the BIRC5 gene transfection promoted the invasion of VECs by increasing MMP

expression [31]. By rat experiments, after cerebral ischemia, the higher expressions of survivin protein in microvasculature were observed, revealing the protein’s important biological and therapeutic sign i can ce in cerebral ischemia [14]. Additionally, the possible roles of survivin in maintaining long-term endo the li al integrity and homeostasis and as an angiogenic factor for therapeutic ang io genesis of vascular diseases were revealed by previous experiments.  

Genetic studies have conﬁrmed that gene expression is aﬀected by gene polymorphism within the promoter and/or the gene’s other regulatory regions. It means, the polymorphisms of the BIRC5 gene have a possible inﬂuence on the structure and function of survivin, thus regulating the occurrence and development of various diseases by changing the survivin activity. Moreover, rs2071214 located in the exon 4 of the BIRC5 gene is identiﬁed as a risk factor of tumor pathogen es is [29]. Te association between the BIRC5 gene polymorphism and diseases has been repeatedly reported. Previous studies have found that rs2071214 mutation could lead to the change of amino acid from Lys to Glu at codon 129 of exon 4. Homo dimer iz ation is induced by the acetyl ation of lysine 129 position of survivin, while de acetyl ation promotes the formation of survivin monomers he ter odi meri zing with CRM1. Moreover, it also facilitates nuclear export [32]. As a gene target of STAT3, survivin is of sign i can ce to the neuro protection of estradiol, as evidenced by the ﬁnding that the shRNA of survivin reversed the neuro protection in the rat models of cerebral ischemia [33]. Te mutation of rs2071214 in the neuroblastoma cell lines was found to down regulate survivin synthesis in the nucleus [34]. For patients suﬀering from non-small cell lung cancer, rs3764383 polymorphism has been proved to be a negative factor of poor prognosis [35]. It is eﬀective to help patients with ischemic stroke lower the risk of hemorrhagic transformation [36]. Survivin was up regulated when angiogenic growth factors, such as VEGF and ang io poi etin-1 were released in the vascular endo the li al cells [14]. Whether the biologic role of amino acid alterations correlated with BIRC5 polymorphism in collateral circulation remains unclear. Te functional consequences of the BIRC5 mutation may play a critical role in collateral circulation integrity and homeostasis by inhibiting VEC apoptosis, altering enzymatic activity, and modifying the characteristics of Ang-1, VEGF, and other angiogenic growth factors. Te ident i cation of the factors that promote stroke will help prevent and control this disease, [37] while this study provides the clinical evidence that the polymorphism of BIRC5 could potentially serve as a biomarker to evaluate the severity of stroke.  

4.1. Limitations.  Te limitations of the present study are listed below. Firstly, the research objects were the small case number and the inherent defects of its retrospective study nature. Terefore, a larger sample size is needed for further studies. Secondly, only one site of rs2071214 was considered, failing to completely represent the polymorphism of other loci. Moreover, the mechanism of rs2071214 polymorphism aﬀecting collateral circulation was not investigated.  

# 5. Conclusions  

In conclusion, our results conﬁrm that BIRC5 polymorphism is associated with the collateral circulation and severity of large artery at hero sclerotic stroke. Furthermore, patients with rs2071214 variant genotype presented poor collateral circulation and stroke severity. Further exploration is still needed to examine the mechanism of the SNP of rs2071214 on collateral circulation.
