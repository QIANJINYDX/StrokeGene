Abstract The dose required for the anticoagulant effect of warfarin exhibits large inter-individual variations. This study sought to determine the contribution of four genes, vitamin K epoxide reductase ( VKORC1 ),    $\upgamma$  -glutamyl carboxyl as e ( GGCX ), calumenin ( CALU ), and cytochrome P450 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ) to the warfarin maintenance dose required in Japanese patients following ischemic stroke. We recruited 93 patients on stable anti coagulation with a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 1.6 – 2.6. We genotyped eleven representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the three genes involved in vitamin K cycle and the   $42613\mathsf{A}{>}\mathsf{C}$   SNP in CYP2C9 , known as    $C Y P2C g*_{3}$  , and then examined an association of these genotypes with warfarin maintenance doses (mean  $\pm\,\mathsf{S}\mathsf{D}\!=\!2.96\pm1.06$   mg/day). We found an association of effective warfarin dose with the  $\mathrm{-}1639\mathsf{G}\mathrm{>}\mathsf{A}$     $(p\!=\!0.004)$   and   $3730\mathsf{G}\!\!>\!\!\mathsf{A}$  genotypes   $(p\!=\!0.006)$   in  VKORC1 , the   $8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$   genotype in  GGCX    $(p\!=\!0.022)$  , and the  $42613\mathsf{A}{>}\mathsf{C}$   genotype in  CYP2C9    $(p\!=\!0.015)$  ). The model using the multiple regression analysis including age, sex, weight, and three genetic polymorphisms accounted for  $33.3\%$   of total variations in warfarin dose. The contribution to inter-individual variation in warfarin dose was   $5.9\%$   for  VKORC1    $-\,1639\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$  ,   $5.2\%$   for  CYP2C9  $42613\mathsf{A}{>}\mathsf{C}$  , and   $4.6\%$   for  GGCX  8016G N A. In addition to polymorphisms in  VKORC1  and CYP2C9 , we identified  $G G C X\,8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$  , resulting in the missense mutation R325Q, as a genetic determinant of warfarin maintenance dose in Japanese patients.  $\copyright$   2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Warfarin is the most widely prescribed anticoagulant for long-term prevention of thromboembolic events. The dose of warfarin required to achieve target levels of anti coagulation varies dependent on dietary intake and individual variations in p harm a co kinetics. Management of warfarin therapy is difficult because of significant inter-individual and intra-individual variability and the narrow therapeutic range. The effectiveness and safety of warfarin must be monitored by serial determinations of prothrombin time using the standardized international normalized ratio (INR).  

Warfarin exerts an anticoagulant effect by interfering with the regeneration of reduced vitamin K from the epoxide form, which is required for the enzymatic activity of vitamin K epoxide reductase subunit 1 (VKORC1)  [1,2] .  $\upgamma$  -Carboxyl ation of a wide variety of proteins, including numbers of factors in the clotting cascade, is catalyzed by    $\upgamma$  -glutamyl carboxyl as e (GGCX), a vitamin K-dependent enzyme. This reaction incorporates a carbon dioxide molecule into specific glutamic acid residues with the help of the reduced form of vitamin K and oxygen, generating    $\upgamma$  -carboxyl glutamic acid and vitamin K 2,3-epoxide. When reduced vitamin K cannot be regenerated, the biosynthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation/anti coagulation factors, including pro thro mb in, factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C and S, is suppressed. The endoplasmic reticulum resident protein calumenin (CALU) associates with    $\upgamma$  -glutamyl carboxyl as e, inhibiting its activity  [3] . Recent studies on the genetic aspects of the inter-individual variability of warfarin have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  VKORC1  gene influence warfarin responses  [4 – 15] . Haplotype analysis demonstrated that individuals who can be controlled by the low dose of warfarin showed the low hepatic expression of  VKORC1  mRNA  [6] .  

The inter-individual variability of warfarin can also be explained by the genetic variability of the warfarin metabolizing enzyme,  CYP2C9 . The missense mutations R144C and I359L in the  CYP2C9  gene known as  $C Y P2C g^{*}2$   and    $C Y P2C g*_{3}$   are known to associate with warfarin dose  [16] . These two genetic variations exhibited ethnic specificity. Asian population does not have the    $C Y P2C g^{*}2$   allele but carries the  $C Y P2C g*_{3}$   allele  [17] .  

In this study, we investigated the influence of SNPs in four genes controlling    $\upgamma$  -carboxyl ation ( VKORC1 ,  GGCX ,  CALU , and  CYP2C9 ) on the interindividual variability of warfarin dose requirements in Japanese patients. We identified SNPs in VKORC1 ,  GGCX , and  CYP2C9  associated with the inter-individual differences in warfarin dosage.  

# Materials and methods  

# Subjects  

The study population consisted of 93 unrelated Japanese patients admitted to the Cerebro vascular Division of the National Cardiovascular Center between November 2003 and March 2004. The patients had all experienced an ischemic stroke within the 7 days prior to admission. Stroke subtype consisted of card i oem boli c infarction   $(n\!=\!48)$   and the embolic infarction of unknown origin with non-valvular atrial fibrillation   $(n\!=\!45)$  . Anti coagulation of all patients was stably controlled with a target INR of 1.6 – 2.6 for the prevention of stroke recurrence  [18,19] . Inclusion criteria were a confirmed date of initial exposure to warfarin, and current anti coagulation therapy. Data collection consisted of inpatient and outpatient medical records. The anticoagulant database was used to obtain information on daily warfarin doses. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the National Cardiovascular Center. All patients who participated in the study provided written informed consent for genetic analysis.  

# DNA analyses  

We previously performed DNA sequence analyses of 3 genes ( VKORC1 ,  GGCX , and  CALU ) involved in vitamin K cycling in 96 Japanese stroke patients; that study identified genetic polymorphisms and pair-wise linkage d is equilibrium (LD)  [20] . Using the minor allele frequency (over  $4\%$  ), LD (  $\cdot r^{2}$    more than 0.5), and possible functional change (missense mutation) as guidance, we selected nine representative SNPs for genotyping:  $523\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$  ,   $1338\mathsf{A\!\!>\!G}$   (H68R), and   $3730\mathsf{G}\!\!>\!\!\mathsf{A}$  in  VKORC1 ,  $412\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$  ,  $8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$   (R325Q), and   $8445\mathsf{C}\!>\!\mathsf{T}$  in GGCX, and  $\uparrow\uparrow\tt G>>A$  (R4Q),  $3446{>}\mathsf{A}$ , and  $20943\mathsf{T}\!\!>\!\!\mathsf{A}$  inCALU . In  CYP2C9 , only the   $42613\mathsf{A}\!\!>\!\mathsf{C}$   (I359L) SNP, known as the    $C Y P2C g*_{3}$   genotype, was analyzed. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated the significant association of the  VKORC1  polymorphisms  $\scriptstyle-1639\mathsf{G}>\mathsf{A}$   and   $1173\mathsf{C}{>}\mathsf{T}$   with warf polymorphisms. We adopted the numbering standards of the Nomenclature Working Group, wherein the A of the initiator Met codon (ATG) is denoted nucleotide   $+\,1$   [21] .  

The genotypes of the 12 SNPs in our subjects were identified by the TaqMan-PCR system. TaqMan genotyping methodology has been described previously [22] . The PCR primers and probes used for the TaqMan system are available on request.  

# Statistical analysis  

The significance level for all statistical tests was set at  $P{<}0.05$  . Pair-wise LD between two polymorphisms was evaluated by    $r^{2}$    using SNPAlyze v4.0 software (DYNACOM, Kanagawa, Japan). Statistical analyses were performed using JMP v 5.1 software and the SAS release 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Associations between genotypes and warfarin daily doses were examined by one-way analysis of variance or univariate regression analysis. In addition, the relative contributions of age, sex, weight, and selected genetic variations to inter-individual variations in warfarin dose were estimated by using the multiple regression analysis. An index  $P_{i}$  , for estimating the relative contribution of a specific independent variable,  $x_{i}$  , was employed and given by  

$$
P_{i}=R^{2}{-}R_{-j}^{2},
$$  

where    $R$   was the multiple correlation coefficient from the model with all of the selected independent variables   $(x_{1},\ x_{2},...,\ x_{p})$   and    $R_{\mathrm{~-}j}^{2}$   was that of the model excluding    $x_{i}$   from the independent variables.  

# Results  

We analyzed the frequency of 11 SNPs in three genes involved in the vitamin K cycle and one polymorphism in  CYP2C9  42613A N C   $(C Y P2C g^{*}3)$   in 93 stroke patients under stable anti coagulation with warfarin. Characteristics of the patients are summarized

Age, weight, and warfarin dose are shown as mean  $\pm\,\mathsf{S}\mathsf{D}$  .

$P$   values were calculated by one-way ANOVA.  ⁎ These SNPs were in linkage d is equilibrium. Rieder et al. reported that the hepatic expression levels of  VKORC1  mRNA were significantly decreased in the carriers with the  VKORC1  − 1639A allele  [6] . As for the  GGCX  R325Q mutation, there were no available data on its function. CYP2C9 mutant carrying the missense mutation, I359L   $(C Y P2C g^{*}3)$  , showed a markedly high  K m for the 7-hydroxyl ation of  S -warfarin  [28] .  

in  Table 1 . The mean  $\pm\,\mathsf{S}\mathsf{D}$   daily warfarin dose was  $2.96\pm1.06\ \mathsf{m g}/$  day   $(1.00{-}5.50\;\mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{d a y})$  .  

We examined the association of the genotype data with maintenance warfarin doses by oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA). Of the 12 SNPs examined, five SNPs,    $\mathrm{-}\,1639\mathsf{G}\mathrm{>}\mathsf{A}$  ,   $1173\mathsf{C}\mathrm{>}\mathsf{T},$  , and  $3730\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$  in VKORC1,  $8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$  (R375Q) in GGCX,and    $C Y P2C g*_{3}$   exhibited a significant association with daily warfarin dose ( Table 2 ). The  VKORC1  $1338\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$   allele could not be evaluated due to the low minor allele frequency. None of the other SNPs demonstrated a significant association with warfarin dosage.  

The mean warfarin dose was higher (  $(p\!=\!0.004)$  ) in patients with the  VKORC1  − 1639GA or 1173CT genotypes   $(3.70\,\mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{d a y})$   than in those with the  − 1639AA or 1173TT genotypes   $(2.83\,\mathrm{\meg/d a y})$  . The mean warfarin dose was higher   $(p\!=\!0.006)$  ) in patients with the  VKORC1  3730GA genotype (  $3.68\ \mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{d a y})$   than in those with the 3730GG genotype   $(2.84\,\mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{d a y})$  . For  CYP2C9 , the mean warfarin dose was higher  $(p\!=\!0.015)$   in patients with the    $C Y P2C g^{*}\mathcal{I}^{*}\mathcal{I}$   ( CYP2C9 42613AA) genotype   $(3.06~\mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{d a y})$   than in those with the  $^{*}\!\uparrow^{*}\!3$   (42613AC) genotype (2.17 mg/day).  

A significant association was observed between warfarin dosage and the   $8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$   SNP of  GGCX . The mean warfarin dose was higher   $\scriptstyle(p\,=\,0.022)$  ) among patients with the  GGCX  8016GG genotype   $(3.25\,\mathsf{m g}/$  day) than in those with the GA   $(2.84\,\mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{d a y})$  ) or AA (2.79 mg/day) genotypes. The  GG  $C X\,8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$  SNP, rs699664, leads to the substitution of Gln for Arg at amino acid 325.  

We previously genotyped three SNPs,    ${}-1639\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A},$  ,  $1173\mathsf{C}\mathrm{>}\mathsf{T},$   and   $3730\mathsf{G}\!\!>\!\!\mathsf{A}$   in  VKORC1 , in 3652 population-based individuals  [20] . This analysis obtained a minor allele frequency of 0.086 for all SNPs. Three SNPs were in tight LD with a pair-wise    $r^{2}$    value of 0.98. Two SNPs in particular,    $\mathrm{-}\,1639\mathsf{G}\mathrm{>}\mathsf{A}$   and  $1173\mathsf{C}\mathrm{>}\mathsf{T},$   were in complete LD in the study population. Therefore,    $\tt-1639G{>}\tt{A}$   and  $3730\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$   were used for additional analysis to estimate the influence of VKORC1  genotypes of warfarin dosage.  

To estimate the contribution of each SNP to variabilities in warfarin dosages, we performed univariate regression analyses for four SNPs,  VKORC1  − 1639G N A and  $3730\mathsf{G}\!\!>\!\!\mathsf{A}$  ,  GGCX  8016G N A, and  CYP2C9  42613A N C  $(C Y P2C g^{*}3)$   ( Table 3 ). The  $R^{2}$    values determined for VKORC1    $\scriptstyle-1639\mathsf{G}>\mathsf{A}$   and   $3730\mathsf{G}\!\!>\!\!\mathsf{A}$   were 0.086 and 0.082, respectively. The equivalent  $R^{2}$    value observed in the model of  $G G C X\,8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$     $(R^{2}{=}0.081)$  ) was higher than that of    $C Y P2C9\,42613\mathbb{A}{>}0$   (  $(R^{2}\!=\!0.064)$  .  

Multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative contributions of age, sex, weight, and three genetic polymorphisms to the inter-individual variations in warfarin dose. These results were shown in  Table 4 . The model included age, sex, weight, and three genetic polymorphisms, 6 variables in total, as the independent variables and accounted for   $33.3\%$   of total variations in warfarin dose. The contribution,    $P_{i}$  , to interindividual variation in warfarin dose was   $5.9\%$   for VKORC1    $-\,1639\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$  ,   $5.2\%$   for  CYP2C9    $42613\mathsf{A}\!\!>\!\mathsf{C}$  , and   $4.6\%$   for    $G G C X\,8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$  .  

# Discussion  

In this study, we have examined the contribution of four genes to the warfarin maintenance dose required in Japanese patients following ischemic stroke. The patients were controlled in the target INR of 1.6 – 2.6. A previous study on the optimal intensity of warfarin therapy for secondary prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation showed that the low-intensity warfarin (INR 1.5 to 2.1) treatment seemed to be safer than the conven

 $R^{2}$    and    $P$   values were calculated by univariate regression analyses.  ⁎ These two SNPs were in linkage d is equilibrium.

tional-intensity (INR 2.2 to 3.5) treatment  [18] . The annual rate of ischemic stroke was low in both groups (  $1.1\%$   per year in the conventional-intensity group and  $1.7\%$   per year in the low-intensity group) and did not differ significantly. Based on this result and the guideline of the Japanese Circulation Society for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, we adopted the target INR of 1.6 – 2.6. Daily warfarin dose of each patient was properly controlled to meet target INR. As a result, the range of the warfarin dose was between 1 and   $10\,{\sf m g}$  .  

Warfarin is the most prescribed oral anticoagulant. Warfarin targets VKORC1 and antagonizes vitamin K, an essential cofactor for the modification of specific glutamic acid to    $\upgamma$  -carbo xy glutamic acid in coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X. Warfarin is metabolized by CYP2C9. Patients with    $C Y P2C g*_{2}$  and    $C Y P2C g^{*}3$   alleles have lower mean daily warfarin doses and a greater risk of bleeding [16,23] . Recent studies on  VKORC1  showed that SNPs in  VKORC1  have a more important function than the  CYP2C9  variations in terms of inter-individual variability of warfarin. It has been reported that the VKORC1  haplotype accounted for   $21\%$   of inter-individual variability of warfarin and the  CYP2C9  genotype explained  $6\%$   [6] . Subsequent studies reached the similar conclusion that the  VKORC1  genotype affects inter-individual variability of warfarin more greatly than the  CYP2C9  genotype  [5,8 – 11] . Inclusion of non-genetic factors such as age, sex, body surface area, body weight, and drug interaction with genotype information accounted for up to   $60\%$   of inter-individual variability of warfarin  [5,8 – 11] . The remaining  $40\%$   of warfarin dosing variability remains unexplained.  

In our study,  VKORC1  − 1639G N A explained  $5.9\%$   of the inter-individual var i abilities in warfarin dose, while   $\mathsf{C Y P2C9}^{*}3$   explained   $5.2\%$   ( Table 4 ). We also detected a significant association between  GGCX  $8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$   (R325Q) and warfarin dosage, which explained   $4.6\%$   of the variability seen in our subjects ( Table 4 ). We have recently reported that  GGCX  $8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$   influences the inter-individual variations in protein C activity in the general population of Japan; women with the GG genotype exhibit approximately  $5\%$   higher plasma protein C activity   $(p\!=\!0.002)$   than those with either the GA or AA genotypes  [20] . The R325Q mutation is predicted by the topological model to reside within the cytoplasmic domain of GGCX [24] . In this domain, amino acids 343 – 355 mediate GGCX enzyme/substrate interactions; residues 343 – 345 of CVY are necessary for both substrate binding and    $\upgamma$  -carboxyl as e activity  [25] .  

Recent studies reported the association of a micro satellite marker in intron 6 of  GGCX  with warfarin dose  [26,27] . In 45 warfarin-treated Japanese patients, 10, 11, and 13 CAA repeats were detected. Three individuals heterozygous for the 13 repeat allele required higher maintenance doses than patients with fewer repeats  [26] . In 183 warfarin-treated Swedes, a group of individuals bearing both alleles with 13 repeats or those with 14 – 16 repeats required significantly higher maintenance doses than patients with fewer repeats. Taken together, GGCX is a promising candidate influencing warfarin maintenance doses significantly. Further studies with larger populations and additional ethnic groups are required to elucidate the association between variations in warfarin dosages and the    $G G C X\,8016\mathsf{G}{>}\mathsf{A}$   genotype.
