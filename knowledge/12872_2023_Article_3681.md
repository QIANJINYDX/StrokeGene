# Abstract  

Background   Several studies have investigated the correlation between ph os ph odi est erase 4D ( PDE4D ) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs918592 and the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in Chinese populations. But the results were  inconsistent and inconclusive. Therefore, to resolve this conflict, we conducted a meta-analysis to further elucidate  their relationship in Chinese populations.  

Methods   Studies focused on SNP rs918592 and IS risk were electronic searched in the databases of PubMed,  Embase, ISI Web of Science, Weipu, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical (CBM)  and Wanfang. The association between SNP rs918592 and IS risk was expressed by odds ratio (OR) with its confidence interval (CI). Begg’s and Egger’s linear regression tests were used to assess publication bias. The meta-analysis  was performed with STATA 11.0 statistical software. Two online prediction websites (HaploReg and RegulomeDB) were  adopted to explore the functions of SNP rs918592.  

Results   The meta-analysis ultimately included 10 studies involving 2,348 cases and 2,289 controls. The results  showed that there was a significant correlation between SNP rs918592 and IS risk in Chinese individuals. The G allele  had reduced risk of developing IS compared to the A allele (OR 0.83,   $95\%$   CI 0.74–0.95,   $P\!=\!0.005,$  ). HaploReg and RegulomeDB analyses suggested that SNP rs918592 and its strongly linked SNPs (e.g. rs34168777) might have regulatory  functions.  

Conclusion   This study shows that SNP rs918592 in  PDE4D  may be a contributor of IS risk in Chinese populations. It  offers a good answer for the association of  PDE4D  SNP rs918592 with IS risk in Chinese populations for the first time.

# Introduction  

Stroke is one of the most frequent contributors to disability and mortality in the world, including China. In China,  according to a cross-sectional survey of stroke burden in  155 urban and rural centers in 31 provinces, the crude  stroke incidence rate was 345.1/100,000 person-years [ 1 ].  Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most common type of stroke,  which makes up approximately   $80\%$   of all stroke cases.  The occurrence and development of most IS is the result  of the interaction between genetic and environmental  risk factors.  

Ph os ph odi est erase 4D (PDE4D), which can specifically degrade cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP), has been implicated in the pathogeny of IS. It  is expressed in many cells such as immune cells (T lymphocytes, macrophages, and monocytes), endo the li al  cells, smooth muscle cells, and atrial myocytes [ 2 – 4 ].  A decrease in the cAMP concentration promotes vascular smooth muscle proliferation [ 5 ]. Conversely, an  increase in cAMP attenuates the formation of neointima and suppresses vascular smooth muscle proliferation after arterial injury [ 6 ]. PDE4, including PDE4D,  are the major enzymes of cAMP signal transduction  pathway in inflammatory cells. A decline in cAMP  leads to inflammation [ 7 ]. Inflammation may contribute  to atrial fibrillation and atherosclerosis, both of which  are risk factors for IS.  

In 2002 and 2003, the deCODE Genetics group conducted linkage and association analyses in the Icelandic  population and identified  PDE4D  as a susceptible gene of  IS [ 8 ,  9 ]. Since then, whether the genetic variants of this  gene are related to stroke has become a research hotspot.  In Chinese populations, single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP) rs918592, lying in an intron near the   $5'$   end of  PDE4D , has been investigated whether it was associated  with IS risk. But the results of different studies were discordant. For instance, Tang (2007) [ 10 ] reported a negative result, while Xu et al. (2008) [ 11 ] and He et al. (2012)  [ 12 ] reported positive results. Therefore, in order to further elucidate the correlation between SNP rs918592 and  the risk of IS in Chinese populations, we carried out the  present meta-analysis. No studies have explored the functions of SNP rs918592 to date, so we preliminarily ana- lyzed it using bioinformatics approaches.  

# Methods  

The present study was conducted following the Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement [ 13 ]. The PRISMA checklist can be found in Additional file  1 .  

# Search strategy  

We searched the PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, Weipu, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical (CBM) and Wanfang  databases from inception to November 30, 2023, using  the following items: “ph os ph odi est erase 4D”, “PDE4D”,  “rs918592”, “polymorphism”, “stroke”, “cerebral infarction”, “ischemic stroke”, “cerebro vascular disease”, and  their synonyms. The references of the identified articles, as well as relevant reviews and meta-analyses,  were also manually scanned for other potentially eligible studies.  

# Study selection  

The selection of studies should be based on the following criteria: (a) case-control, nested case-control, or  cohort studies; (b) assessment of the correlation between  SNP rs918592 and IS risk in Chinese populations; and (c)

using validated techniques to detect SNP rs918592. Articles were excluded if they (a) had no primary findings, (b)  were reviews, editorials, case reports, case-only studies,  or family-based studies, or (c) were duplicate studies.  

# Data extraction  

The following information was collected from each qualified study: first author’s name, year of publication, ethnicity of participants, number of cases and controls, mean  age of cases and controls, methods for detecting SNP  rs918592, matching variables of controls, IS subtypes (if  mentioned in the article), as well as number of alleles and  genotypes.  

Literature screening, data collection, and assessment of study quality were conducted independently by  two researchers (X.Y. and G. Z.). The divergences that  occurred through the process were settled by discussing  with the corresponding author (R. L.).  

# Statistical analyses  

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was evaluated by a  Chi-square test in the controls. Statistical analyses were  performed using STATA 11.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). The strength of association  between SNP rs918592 and IS risk was calculated using  pooled odds ratios (ORs) with   $95\%$   confidence intervals 

 (CIs) for two comparisons between different genotypes 

 (AG vs. AA, and GG vs. AA), as well as under dominant 

 (  $\cdot G G+{\mathrm{AC}}$   vs. AA), additive (G vs. A), and recessive (GG  vs.   $\mathrm{AC}\!+\!\mathrm{AA},$  ) genetic models.  

The heterogeneity between studies was assessed with  chi-square-based   $\mathrm{Q}.$  -test and   $I^{2}$   test. When   $P$   value was  above 0.10, a fixed-effects model using the Mantel-Haenszel method was selected for data analysis; otherwise,  a random-effects model using the Der Simoni an-Laird  method was conducted.   $I^{2}$   metric was used to show the  degree of heterogeneity, where   $0{-}25\%$  ,   $25{-}50\%$  ,   $50{-}75\%$  and   $75{-}100\%$   meant no, moderate, large, and extreme  heterogeneity, respectively. The underlying factors

Fig. 3   Forest plot for the relationship between the risk of ischemic stroke and SNP rs918592 (GG vs AA) (random effects)  

causing heterogeneity were explored by meta-regression  analysis.  

Sensitivity analyses by sequentially removing each  study at a time were performed to test the stability of the  results. Publication bias was estimated by Begg’s test with  funnel plot and Egger’s linear regression test with publication bias plot.  

# In Silico bioinformatics analysis  

To explore the functions of SNP rs918592, two online  prediction websites were used for bioinformatics analysis: HaploReg ( http://​pubs.​broad​insti​tute.​org/​mamma​ls/​ haplo​reg/​haplo​reg.​php ) and RegulomeDB ( http://​regul​ omedb.​org/ ). HaploReg was applied to discover noncoding genomic annotations for variants and determine their  underlying causal correlations with disease pathogen es is.  RegulomeDB was utilized for the annotation of variants  with regulatory elements by giving ranks. The lower the  rank, the more likely it is to have a regulatory function.  

# Results  

# Eligible studies  

After literature search and further screening, 12 articles  in total met the inclusive criteria (Fig.  1 ). Four were subsequently excluded by careful reading of the full text. Xu’s  (2008) [ 14 ], Bai’s (2011) [ 15 ] and Sun’s (2013) [ 16 ] studies overlapped with Xu’s (2008) [ 11 ], He’s (2012) [ 12 ]  and Ma’s (2014) [ 17 ] studies, respectively, and then were  excluded. In Zhang’s (2019) study, SNP87 was incorrectly labeled as rs918592 and actually rs2910829 [ 18 ].  Two articles investigated the association in independent populations, so each article was considered as two  independent studies [ 17 ,  19 ]. Finally, 10 studies (in 8  articles involving 2,348 IS cases and 2,289 controls) were  enrolled in the meta-analysis of the correlation between  SNP rs918592 and IS risk (Table  1  and Additional file  2 :  Table  S1) [ 10 – 12 ,  17 ,  19 – 22 ]. Each study design was  case-control. The genotypic distribution of one study [ 22 ]  deviated from HWE expectation in controls (Additional  file 2: Table S2).

# SNP rs918592 and ischemic Stroke risk  

Significant association of SNP rs918592 with IS risk was  observed in two comparisons and all the three genetic  models (Table  2 ; Figs.  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5  and  6 ). The G allele was  related to reduced risk of IS (G vs. A: OR 0.83,   $95\%$   CI   $0.74{-}0.95$  ,   $\scriptstyle P=0.005.$  ). Among the three genetic models,  the dominant model had the smallest OR   $(G G+\mathrm{AC}$   vs.  AA: 0.74,   $95\%$   CI 0.61–0.90) and   $P$   value (0.003), and  it might be the best-fitting model. Moderate or large  heterogeneity was identified across all studies in the  comparison between GG and AA, as well as under the  dominant and additive models. Ethnicity, genotyping  method, mean age, sample size, and HWE were not the  main factors causing heterogeneity, while Song’s (2015)  study [ 21 ] might be one of the factors causing heterogeneity. After excluding Song’s (2015) study, there was  no heterogeneity between studies under the dominant  and additive models (Table  2  and Additional file  2 : Figs.  S1-S5). Notably, all of the patients included in Song’s  (2015) study had hypertension, which was markedly  different from other studies. All the pooled OR values  were not substantially altered after excluding Song’s 

 (2015) study.  

# Sensitivity analyses and publication bias  

When any single study was removed, the pooled OR  value was not significantly affected (Additional file   2 :  Figs. S6-S10), suggesting good stability of the results in  the present study. Moreover, the results of Begg’s and  Egger’s linear regression tests displayed no significant  publication bias (Figs.  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10  and  11 ).  

# Functional annotation  

We analyzed the functional roles of SNP rs918592 and  variants in strong linkage d is equilibrium (LD) with  it (defined as   $r^{2}\!\geq\!0.8$   with rs918592 in the East Asian 

 (CHB, JPT, and CHS) population) using HaploReg v4.1 

 (Additional file   2 : Table  S2). The results showed that  SNP rs918592 and the correlated 20 variants mapped  to  PDE4D  intronic regions. All of them might affect  transcriptional regulatory element activity and be  identified as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)

Among the correlated variants, two might  be located within the histone modification regions of  enhancers and one in promoters; two were in DNase  I-hypersensitive regions; two had the alteration in  transcription factor (TF) binding; one (rs918590)

was related to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 E1  ( UBE2E1 ) expression in peripheral blood monocytes;  and two were located in evolutionarily conserved  regions predicted to be functionally constrained  according to SiPhy or GERP analysis. As a whole, SNP  rs34168777   $(r^{2}\!=\!0.99)$   (with evidence of conserved  region, enhancer histone mark, DNase I-hypersensitive  region, TF-binding, any TF motif, and eQTL hit) might  be worthiest of further functional study. The results of  RegulomeDB   $\mathrm{v}2.1$   also showed that rs34168777 had a  rank of 1b   $(\mathrm{eQTL+TF}$   binding  $+$   any motif  $^+$   DNase  Footprint  $^+$   DNase peak), which was the best ranking  among the 21 SNPs (Additional file  2 : Table S3). The  rank of SNP rs918592 was 1f.

# Discussion  

The present meta-analysis revealed that SNP rs918592  was related to the risk of IS in Chinese populations.  Although the sample size of the present study was not  large, the results were stable in various comparisons and  models. So far as we know, this study is the first metaanalysis of the relationship between SNP rs918592 and IS  risk in Chinese populations.  

In fact, we found only one (Song’s (2006)) study [ 23 ]  on the correlation between SNP rs918592 and IS risk  outside the Chinese populations during literature search.  This study focused on early-onset IS in a female population, which showed the A allele of SNP rs918592 was the  risk allele in African-Americans and Caucasians, similar  to the present study. They also pointed out linkage disequilibrium existed between SNPs rs918592 and rs152312

(SNP 41, related to IS in Icelanders) among Caucasians   $(\mathrm{LD}\!=\!0.66)$   and African-Americans (  $(\mathrm{LD}\!=\!1.0)$  ).  But the deCODE Genetics group incorrectly labeled  SNP41 as rs152312 in 2003 [ 9 ], which was corrected to  rs12153798 in 2005. That is, actually, rs12153798, rather  than rs152312, was associated with IS risk in the Icelandic population. Since both Song’s (2006) study and our  meta-analysis suggest that SNP rs918592 is associated  with IS risk, we suggest that future studies should be  extended not only in the Chinese populations but also in  others.  

The deCODE Genetics group revealed the association of  PDE4D  variants with IS risk, particularly strong  with the risk of card i oem boli c (CE) and large artery  atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke [ 9 ]. We tried to perform the analysis in IS subtypes. There were only two

studies for LAA stroke (402 cases and 420 controls)  and two studies for small vessel stroke (295 cases and  420 controls) (Additional file  2 : Tables S4, S5). Therefore, there were not enough data for meta-analyses  of IS subtypes. It is unclear which subtype of IS SNP  rs918592 is mainly associated with. It is a shortcoming  of this study.  

SNP rs918592 is an intron variant of  PDE4D  and may  be a causal variant or just a marker in LD with the causal  variant. It is necessary to further investigate the functions  of SNP rs918592 and variants in LD with it to find the  true pathogenic variant. The results of functional prediction showed that SNP rs918592 and its linked 20 variants  might have regulatory functions and SNP rs34168777  was the most likely causal variant among them. We only  predicted their possible functions, but did not carry out  experiments to validate them, which is another shortcoming of this study.

# Conclusion  

This study suggests that SNP rs918592 in  PDE4D  may  contribute to IS risk in Chinese populations. It provides a better answer for the association of  PDE4D  SNP  rs918592 with IS risk in Chinese populations. Larger and  more refined studies will be conducive to elucidate this  effect on IS, especially on CE and LAA stroke. Further  functional studies are also required to identify the causal  variant(s).
