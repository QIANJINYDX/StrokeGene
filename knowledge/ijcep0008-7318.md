Abstract:  Little is known about the association of the  FADS1/FADS2  SNPs and serum lipid levels and the risk of  coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS) in the Chinese southern population. The present study aimed  to determine such association in the Chinese southern population. A total of 1,669 unrelated subjects (CAD, 534;  IS, 553; and healthy controls, 582) were recruited in the study. Genotypes of the  FADS1  rs174546 SNP and the  FADS2  rs174601 SNP were determined by the SNaPshot Multiplex Kit. The T allele and TT genotype frequencies of  the two SNPs were predominant in our study population. The T alleles were associated with increased risk of CAD  and IS. Correspondingly, the C alleles were associated with reduced risk of CAD and IS. Haplotype analyses showed  that the haplotype of T-T (rs174546-rs174601) was associated with an increased risk for IS, and the haplotype of  C-C (rs174546-rs174601) was associated with a reduced risk for CAD and IS. The two SNPs were likely to influence  serum lipid levels. The T allele carriers of the two SNPs and rs174601 TT genotype were associated with decreased  serum HDL-C and ApoAI levels in the patient groups and with an increased risk of CAD and IS. The present study  suggests that the  FADS1  rs174546 SNP and the  FADS2  rs174601   SNP   are associated with the risk of CAD and IS,  and are likely to influence serum lipid levels. However, further functional studies are needed to clarify how the two  SNPs actually affect serum lipid levels and the risk of CAD and IS.

# Introduction  

Both coronary artery disease (CAD) and isch­ emic stroke (IS) are the most prevalent geriatric  diseases and the major determinant of mortal­ ity and morbidity worldwide [1-3]. As multifacto­ rial diseases, both CAD and IS share common  risk factors, including both lipid and nonlipid  variables, such as metabolic factors, thrombo­ genic/hemostatic factors, and inflammatory  markers [4]. These risk factors are involved in  the initiation, progression and rupture of ath­ ero sclerotic plaque.  

Long-chain  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids  (LC-PUFAs) are important components of cell  membranes, serve as substrates for the syn­ thesis of inflammatory ei cosa noid s (leukotri­ enes and prostaglandin s), act as signaling mol­ ecules, and regulate gene expression [5].  

LC-PUFAs composition of plasma and body tis­ sues has been associated with numerous  health outcomes including cardiovascular  health, allergies, mental health, and cognitive  development [6, 7]. LC-PUFAs could reduce  hepatic very low-density lipoprotein synthesis  contributes to lower plasma triglycerides [8, 9]  and reduce plasma and urine levels of eico­ sanoids such as leu kotri ene E4 and alter sev­ eral inflammatory pathways [10]. Additionally, in  several trials, LC-PUFAs are commonly consid­ ered to have anti-thrombotic effects and  improve endo the li al function and health [11,  12]. The roles of each of these molecular path­ ways could partly mediate protective effects of  LC-PUFAs against cardiovascular disease.  

Tissue LC-PUFAs levels are determined by both  dietary intake and endogenous synthesis via  the successive elongation and de saturation of  dietary fatty acids precursors. Delta-5 desatu­ rase (D5D) and delta-6 desaturase (D6D), the  key enzymes required for the synthesis of  LC-PUFAs [13], are respectively encoded by the  FADS1 and FADS2 genes, which is clustered  with family members at 11q12-q13.1. Many  studies have reported associations between  genetic variants in the FADS1/FADS2 gene  cluster and LC-PUFAs levels [14]. Bokor et al.  [14] indicated that the minor alleles of SNPs  including rs174546 were associated with lower  D5D desaturase activity. Stoffel et al. [15]  found that Loss of FADS2 expression in the  FADS2-null mouse, abolished the synthesis of  LC-PUFAs. Thus, genetic variations in the FADS  gene cluster correlated with a decrease of  desaturase reaction products and an accumu­ lation of substrates, which might have implica­ tions for cardiovascular disease [6, 16-23].  Recently, several studies have showed strong  associations between single nucleotide poly­ morphisms (SNPs) in the FADS1/FADS2 gene  cluster and the risk of cardiovascular disease  [6, 16-23]. Other studies have also reported  relationships between several  FADS1/FADS2   variants and plasma lipid concentrations [21,  22, 24, 25]. However, the mechanisms underly­ ing these associations have not been clearly  established. At present, the associations of the  SNPs in the FADS1/FADS2 gene cluster with  serum lipid levels and risk of cardiovascular  disease have been more reported in the  European populations, relatively little is known  about such association in the Chinese popula­ tions, especially in Chinese south population.  Considering the differences in genetic back­ ground and living habits among different popu­ lation, and searching for novel pathway in lipid  regulation and new therapeutic or preventive  methods for cardiovascular disease, it is of  great interest to evaluate these associations.  Therefore, the aim of the present study was to  investigate the possible association between  the SNPs in the FADS1/FADS2 gene cluster  and serum lipid levels, as well as the risk of  CAD and IS in Chinese south population through  the case-control study.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study population  

A total of 1,087 unrelated patients with CAD ( n   $\,=\,534,$  ) and IS   $(n=553)$  ) were recruited from  hospitalized patients in the First Affiliated  Hospital, Guangxi Medical University from  September 2009 to October 2011. The diagno­ sis of CAD was based on typical clinical symp­ toms and electrocardiograph ic changes, as  well as increases in the serum markers includ­ ing creatinine kinase-MB and troponin T.  Coronary angiography was performed in  patients with CAD. The selected CAD patients  were subject to significant coronary stenosis   $(\geq$     $50\%$  ) in at least either one of the three main  coronary arteries or their major branches  (branch diameter  $\geq2\ \mathsf{m m}$  ). Additionally, angio­ graphic severity of disease was defined as sin­ gle or multi-vessel disease based on the num­ ber of involved artery (luminal narrowing   $\geq$   $50\%$  ) in the three major coronary arteries [26,  27]. The classification of IS was made accord­ ing to the TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute  Stroke Treatment) criteria [28]. The selected IS  patients in the study included individuals who  were eligible for one of the two subtypes of  TOAST criteria: Large-artery atherosclerosis  and Small-vessel occlusion. Subjects with a  history of he mato logic, neoplastic, renal, liver,  thyroid, autoimmune diseases and type I diabe­ tes mellitus were excluded. The selected IS  patients who had a past history of CAD were  excluded, while the selected CAD patients who  had a past history of IS were excluded from the  study.  

A total of 582 healthy subjects matched by age,  gender, and ethnic group (Han Chinese) were  consecutively recruited from Physical Exami-nation Center of the First Affiliated Hospital,  Guangxi Medical University during the same  period when CAD and IS patients were recruit­ ed. The controls were free of CAD and IS by  questionnaires, history taking and clinical  examination. All enrolled individuals were Han  Chinese from Guangxi, the People’s Republic of  China. A standard questionnaire was used to  ascertain the general information and medical  history for all participants. The study protocol  was approved by the Ethics Committee of the  First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical  University. Informed consent was obtained  from all subjects after they received a full expla­ nation of the study.  

Biochemical measurements  

Venous blood sample was drawn from all sub­ jects after at least 12 hours of fasting. The lev­ els of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride

(TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) in samples were determined by enzymatic  methods with commercially available kits.  Serum apo lipoprotein (Apo) AI and ApoB levels  were detected by the immuno turbid i metric  immuno as say. The normal values of serum TC,  TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoAI, ApoB levels, and the  ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in our Clinical Science  Experiment Center were 3.10-5.17, 0.56-1.70, 

 0.91-1.81, 2.70-3.20 mmol/L, 1.00-1.78, 0.63-

  $\bot.\bot4~\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{L}$  , and 1.00-2.50; respectively [29-31].  The individuals with   $\mathsf{T C}>5.17\ \mathsf{m m o l/L}$  , and/or   $\mathsf{T G}>\bot.70\ \mathsf{m m o l/L}$   were defined as hyperlipid­ emic [32]. Hypertension was diagnosed accord­ ing to the criteria of 1999 World Health  Organization International Society of Hyper-tension Guidelines for the management of  hypertension [33]. Uncontrolled hypertension  was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140  mmHg or higher and a diastolic blood pressure  of   $90~\mathsf{m m H g}$   or higher. The subjects with sys­ tolic blood pressure of only   $140\ \mathsf{m m H g}$   or high­ er but a diastolic blood pressure of  $<90\;\mathsf{m m H g}$    were diagnosed as isolated systolic hyperten­ sion. Normal weight, overweight and obesity  were defined as a body mass index (BMI)  $<24$  ,  24-28, and  $>28\;\mathsf{k g}/\mathsf{m}^{2}$  ; respectively [34].  

# SNP selection and genotyping  

The SNPs of rs174546 and rs174601 were  selected as genetic markers. rs174561 (C/T) is  located in   $_3\mathrm{{'}}$  -untranslated regions (UTR) of  FADS1  and rs174601 (C/T) is located in intron  1 of  FADS2 . The two SNPs were selected on the  basis of the following assumptions: (1) Selected  SNPs were established by Haploview (Broad  Institute of MIT and Harvard, USA, version 4.2);  (2) SNPs information was obtained from NCBI  dbSNP Build 132 (http://www.Ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/SNP/); (3) SNPs were restricted to minor  allele frequency (MAF)  $>1\%$  . (4) SNPs might be  associated with the plasma lipids levels in a  recent GWAS [24, 25]; and (5) SNPs might be  either functional or LD with other functional  SNPs [35].  

Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was  extracted from leucocytes of venous blood  using the phenol-chloroform method. The two  SNPs (rs174546, rs174601) were determined  using  SNaPshot  Multiplex  Kit  (Applied  Biosystems Co., USA). The restriction enzymes  for loci rs174546, rs174601 were  SAP  and  EXO  I  (Promega, Epicentre), respectively. The sense  and antisense primers were as follows:

# Statistical analyses  

The statistical analyses were carried out using  the statistical software package SPSS 21.0  (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Quantitative vari­ ables were expressed as mean ± standard  deviation (serum TG levels were presented as  medians and interquartile ranges). Qualitative  variables were expressed as percentages.  Allele frequency was determined via direct  counting, and the standard goodness-of-fit test  was used to test the Handy-Weinberg equilibri­ um. A chi-square analysis was used to evaluate  the difference in genotype distribution and sex  ratio between the groups. The general charac­ teristics between patients and controls were  tested by the Student’s unpaired  t -test. The  association of genotypes and serum lipid  parameters was tested by analysis of covari­ ance (ANCOVA). Any variants associated with

patients in CAD or IS groups had type 2  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension  and hyper lipid emi a. The patient groups  also had significant higher BMI, pulse  pressure, serum TG, and lower levels of  serum TC, HDL-C, ApoAI, the ApoAI/ApoB  ratio   $(P\ <\ 0.05)$  . In addition, compared  with the control group, the IS patients had  higher systolic blood pressure levels and  lower percentage of subjects who con­ sumed alcohol   $(P<0.05)$  ), but there was  no difference in diastolic blood pressure   $(P>0.05)$  . The CAD patients, in contrast,  had lower levels of diastolic blood pres­ sure   $(P<0.05)$  ). There was no difference in  systolic blood pressure   $\textstyle P>0.05,$  ). In com­ parison with CAD patients, the IS patients

had higher levels of blood pressure and HDL-C,  and lower the percentages of subjects who suf­ fered from T2DM   $(P<0.05)$  ).  

the serum lipid parameter at a value of   $P\,<$    0.025 (corresponding to  $P<0.05$   after adjust­ ing for two independent tests by the Bonferroni  correction) were considered statistically signifi­ cant. Unconditional logistic regression was  used to assess the correlation between the risk  of CAD and IS and genotypes. Age, gender, BMI,  smoking and alcohol consumption were adjust­ ed for the statistical analysis. Odds ratio (OR)  and  $95\%$   confidence interval (CI) were calculat­ ed using unconditional logistic regression.  Results were considered to be statistically sig­ nificant if bilateral   $P_{\cdot}$  -values were less than  0.05. The pattern of pair-wise LD between the  selected SNPs was measured by  $\mathsf{D}^{\prime}$   and  $r^{2}$  , and  haplotype frequencies were calculated using  the SHEsis software [36].  

# Genotypic and allelic frequencies  

The genotypic and allelic frequencies of  FADS1   rs174546 and  FADS2  rs174601 are presented  in  Table 2 . The genotype distribution was con­ cordant with the Hardy-Weinberg proportions in  both patients and controls. For rs174546 SNP,  the frequency of the T and C alleles was  $67.7\%$    and  $32.3\%$   in the controls,   $71.7\%$   and  $28.3\%$   in  the CAD patients, and   $72.2\%$   and   $27.8\%$   in the  IS patients respectively. The frequency of the  TT, TC and CC genotypes was   $45.5\%$  ,   $44.2\%$    and   $\pm0.3\%$   in the controls,   $53.0\%$  ,   $37.4\%$   and   $9.6\%$   in the CAD patients, and   $53.3\%$  ,   $37.8\%$    and   $8.9\%$   in the IS patients respectively. For  rs174601 SNP, the frequency of the   $\intercal$   and C  alleles was   $67.9\%$   and   $32.1\%$   in the controls,   $72.8\%$   and   $27.2\%$   in the CAD patients, and   $74.1\%$   and   $25.9\%$   in the IS patients respective­ ly. The frequency of the TT, TC and CC geno­ types was  $46.1\%$  ,  $43.6\%$   and  $\pm0.3\%$   in the con­ trols,   $54.7\%$  ,   $36.3\%$   and   $9.0\%$   in the CAD  patients, and  $56.0\%$  ,   $36.0\%$   and  $8.0\%$   in the IS  patients respectively. The genotypic and allelic  frequencies were different between the con­

# Characteristics of the subjects  

The clinical characteristics of the patients and  healthy controls are shown in  Table 1 . The dif­ ferences in age, gender, serum LDL-C and ApoB  levels, and the percentages of subjects who  smoked cigarettes were not significant between  controls and CAD or IS patients   $(P\;>\;0.05)$  ).  Compared with the controls group, more  

tions of the SNPs with the  risk of CAD and IS. Two com­ mon haplotypes (frequency   $>3\%$  ) derived from the two  SNPs accounted for above   $90\%$   haplotype variations.  The frequency of C-C haplo­ type  (rs174546-rs174601)  was   $31.8\%$   in the controls,   $24.6\%$   in the CAD patients,  and  $25.8\%$   in the IS patients.  The frequency of T-T haplo­ type  (rs174546-rs174601)  was   $67.3\%$   in the controls,   $69.2\%$   in the CAD patients,  and  $72.1\%$   in the IS patients.  The haplotype of C-C was  associated with a decreased  risk for CAD and IS (adjusted   $\mathsf{O R}\,=\,0.72$  ,   $95\%$     ${\sf C}|\,=\,0.60\cdot$  0.87 for CAD, and adjusted   $\mathsf{O R}\,=\,0.76$  ,   $95\%$     ${\sf C I}\,=\,0.63.$  - 0.91 for IS; respectively). In  contrast, the haplotype of T-T

was associated with an increased risk for IS  (adjusted   $\mathsf{O R}=1.32$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}=\pm1.10\!-\!1.59$   for IS  Table 3 ).  

# FADS1/FADS2 SNPs and the risk of CAD and  IS  

FADS1/FADS2 SNPs and the ang io graphic se­ verity of CAD  

For rs174546 SNP, the T allele was associated  with an increased risk of CAD (adjusted Odds  ratio  $(\mathsf{O R})=\bot.30$  ,  $95\%$   confidence interval  $\left(\mathsf{C}\right)=$   

 1.06-1.59) and IS (adjusted   $\mathsf{O R}=1.29$  ,   $95\%$   CI 

  $=\mathbf{\lambda}\mathit{1.06-1.57}$  ) ( Table 2 ). The CC/TC genotypes  were also associated with a decreased risk of  CAD (adjusted  $\mathsf{O R}=0.57$  ,   $95\%~{\sf C I}=0.44{\cdot}0.75$    for CC/TC vs. TT) and IS (adjusted   $\mathsf{O R}=0.62$  ,   $95\%\,{\sf C I}=0.48{\cdot}0.80$   for CC/TC vs. TT). Similarly,  for rs174601 SNP, the T allele was associated  with an increased risk of CAD (adjusted   ${\mathsf{O R}}\,=$   

 1.38,  $95\%\,{\sf C l}=1.13{\cdot}1.69)$   and IS (adjusted OR 

  $=1.42$  ,  $95\%$   $5\%~{\sf C}|=1.16{\cdot}1.73$  ). The CC/TC geno­ types were also associated with a decreased  risk of CAD (adjusted  ${\mathsf{O R}}=0.54$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C l}=0.41.$  -

 0.70 for CC/TC vs. TT) and IS (adjusted   ${\mathsf{O R}}\,=$   

 0.61,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}=0.48{\cdot}0.79$   for CC/TC vs. TT).  

As shown in  Table 4 , there were no significant  effects of the rs174546 and rs174601 on angi­ ographic severity of CAD in different genetic  models   $(P>0.05)$  ).  

Related Risk Factors for CAD and IS  

Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the  incidence of CAD and IS positively correlated  with BMI, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlip­ idemia and negatively correlated with alcohol  consumption ( Table 5 ).  

# FADS1/FADS2 SNPs and serum lipid levels  

The serum lipid levels were different between  genotypes in the CAD and IS patients, but not in  the controls ( Table 6 ). After correction for mul­ tiple testing, the subjects with rs174601 TT  genotype had lower TC, HDL-C and ApoAI levels  than the subjects with CC/TC genotypes in CAD  patients   $(P<0.025)$  ). Carrying T allele carriers  of the rs174546 or rs174601 SNP had lower  HDL-C and ApoAI levels than the non- carriers in  IS patients   $\textstyle P<0.025,$  ).  

Haplotype and the risk of CAD and IS  

The SNPs’ LD patterns were assessed by using  both the   $\mathsf{D}^{\prime}$   and   $r^{2}$    values. The rs174546 SNP  was in strong LD with rs174601   $\mathsf{\left(D^{\prime}=0.951\right.}$  ;   $r^{2}$     $=0.860)$  ). Hence, we performed haplotype anal­ yses with the two SNPs to assess the associa­

# Discussion  

Serum concentrations of TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and  TG are one of the most important risk factors  for atherosclerosis related diseases and are  targets for therapeutic intervention [37]. With  the rapid progress in genome-wide association  (GWA) studies, a number of novel lipid-related  loci have been identified [24, 25]. Several SNPs  in the FADS1/FADS2 gene cluster have been  reported to be associated with lipid metabo­ lism, suggesting that altered desaturase activi­ ties may impact serum lipoprotein levels [14,  21, 24, 25]. However, not all researches have  consistent  findings.  In  a  meta-analysis,  Teslovich et al. [24] reported that the T allele of  rs174546 was associated with lower concen­ trations of HDL-C and LDL-C and higher TG con­ cent rations in European ancestry. In the  Doetinchem Cohort Study, Lu et al. [38] found  that TC concentrations differed significantly  according to the rs174546 genotype. The C  allele of rs174546 was associated with higher  TC. Additionally, Sone et al. [39] reported that  the rs174546 TT genotype was found to be  associated with lower LDL-C levels and a lower  LDL-C/TC ratio, and the TT genotype reduced  the risk of high LDL-C level in Japanese men  aged 40-60. In the Chinese middle-east popu­ lations, Liu et al. [18] reported that the  FADS1  rs174547 SNP, which was completed LD with  rs174546 SNP, the subjects with CC/TC geno­ types had significantly higher TG and lower  HDL-C concentrations in individuals with aver­ age age of 40-50 years old than the subjects  with TT genotype. Zhang et al. [40] also found  that the T allele of rs174546 marginally associ­ ated with TG, with same effect direction to that  in Europeans. In contrast, in the Healthy  Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence  (HELENA) study, Bokor et al. [14] found that  some  FADS1/FADS2  variants, including the  rs174546 SNP, were not associated with serum  lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in European  adolescents. In the present study, our study  showed that no association was observed  between the SNPs of rs174546 and rs174601  and serum lipid levels in controls. However,  after correction for multiple testing, the sub­  

jects with rs174601 TT genotype had lower TC,  HDL-C and ApoAI levels than the subjects with  CC/TC genotypes in CAD patients. The subjects  with the rs174546 or rs174601 T allele carriers  had lower HDL-C and ApoAI levels than the sub­ jects with non-carriers in IS patients, which  inferred that the rs174546 SNP and the  rs174601 SNP were likely to influence serum  lipid levels. Carrying T allele carriers of the two  SNPs and rs174601 TT genotype were associ­ ated with decreased serum HDL-C and ApoAI  and with an increased risk of CAD and IS. Our  results were partly consistent with previous  studies. Reasons for these diverse findings  remain unclear; one of the possible explana­ tions was based on different genetic back­ ground. In our study, the T allele and TT geno­ type frequencies of the two SNPs were more  predominant than the C allele and CC genotype  frequencies, which somewhat differed with the  data from the data of the International HapMap  project: the C and   $\intercal$   allele frequencies of  rs174546 SNP were   $65.9\%$   and   $34.1\%$   in CEU  (Utah residents with ancestry from northern  and western Europe);   $98.7\%$   and   $\pm1.3\%$   in YRI  (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria);   $69.8\%$   and   $30.2\%$    in JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan);   $67.3\%$   and 

  $32.7\%$   in CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China); 

  $45.9\%$   and   $54.1\%$   in CAD (Chinese in  Metropolitan Denver, Colorado). In the previous  studies, the C allele frequencies of rs174546  SNP was predominant, which was inconsistent  with our study. Another possible explanation  was dietary intervention. Dietary habits may  differ in different regions, especially dietary  LC-PUFAs intake, which could confound the  association between the SNPs in this gene  cluster and serum lipid levels. In agreement  with this hypothesis, AlSaleh et al. [41] recently  observed that after the 1.8 g/day eicosapen­ taenoic acid (20: 5n-3, EPA) and do cosa hex a e­ noic acid (22: 6n-3, DHA), TG concentration  decreased significantly more in rs174546 T  allele carriers than in non-carriers. Thirdly, the  participants, especially the individuals with  CAD and IS, might have received statins thera­ pies to influence the lipid metabolism.  Therefore, the results might not truly reflect the  situation of lipids in CAD and IS patients.  

In the present study, we showed that the  rs174546 and rs174601 T alleles were associ­ ated with a higher risk of CAD and IS, suggest­ ing a positive association between the T allele  of the two SNPs and CAD and IS. Multivariate  analysis also showed that well-known risk fac­ tors, such as BMI, diabetes, hypertension and  hyper lipid emi a, were independently associated  with CAD and IS. Additionally, the rs174546  and rs174601 C allele carriers had lower risk of  CAD and IS than non-carriers. In our study, we  found that the rs174546 SNP and the rs174601  SNP existed in strong LD. Haplotypes analyses  suggested that the haplotype of T-T (rs174546- rs174601) was associated with an increased  risk of IS. Meanwhile, the haplotype of C-C  (rs174546-rs174601) was associated with a  decreased risk of CAD and IS after adjusting for  potential confounding factors. Previous studies  showed that the rs174546 T allele is located  within a microRNA target site and is associated  with lower  FADS1  mRNA levels in human liver  [24]. What’s   more, all haplotypes carrying  rs174546 T allele were associated with lower  arachidonic acid (ARA; C20: 4n-6) levels and  lower D5D activity [14], suggesting that the  rs174546 SNP might be either functional or in  LD with other functional SNPs and influence  FADS1/FADS2  transcript abundance. Recently  published studies reported that the rs965867  SNP in the 5’ UTR of  FADS2 , recently demon­ strated to be functional, was in strong LD with  rs174546 SNP [14, 24, 33] and influenced   FADS2   transcription [42]. The rs3834458 [T/ del] in upstream region of  FADS2 , was also  reported to be in strong LD with rs174546 SNP,  had mostly associations with the level of the  direct precursor of inflammatory ei cosa noid s  [35]. The rs174547 SNP in intron region of  FADS1  was in complete LD with rs174546 SNP,  and had been found to associate with  FADS1   transcript levels in the human liver [25]. These  associated SNPs modulates expression of  FADS1/FADS2  [25], which affect desaturase  activity, as a result, leading to lower LC-PUFAs  levels that might be prone to a pro inflammatory  response favoring at hero sclerotic vascular  damage [14, 18]. However, the effects of SNPs  in the FADS1/FADS2 gene cluster on risk of  CAD and IS were an extremely complex pro­ cess. In the Malmö Diet and Cancer   (MDC)   cohort study, Hellstrand et al. [43] have not  observed any statistically significant associa­ tion between rs174546 and risk of CAD and IS,  but a borderline interaction was observed  between the a-linolenic acid (ALA) (18: 3n-3)-tolinoleic acid (LA) (18: 2n-6) intake ratio and  FADS1  genotype on CAD incidence. Likewise,  they also observed a significant interaction  

between ALA and  FADS1  genotype on IS inci­ dence, suggesting the associated effects of  SNPs in the FADS gene cluster on incident CAD  and IS may be modified by dietary PUFAs  intakes, and the health benefit of dietary PUFAs  may depend on individual  FADS1/FADS2   genotypes.  

In the present study, we further investigated  the association between the SNPs of rs174546  and rs174601 and ang io graphic severity of  CAD. Consequently, we failed to found their  relationship, which indicated that the patho­ genic effects of this gene cluster were unlikely  to be a major pathway for lower CAD and IS risk,  but subtle effects cannot be excluded.  

This study has two potential limitations. First,  the drug information was not available in some  participants, thus the effect of drugs or treat­ ments could not be analyzed or excluded. The  patient groups had lower levels of serum TC,  HDL-C than the healthy controls, which was  possibly related to taking cholesterol-lowering  medications in the patient groups. Second,  although we found that the two SNPs were  associated with serum lipid levels and risk of  CAD and IS, we did not explore an association  between the two SNPs and the desaturase  activities, which are important for the further  functional evaluation.  

In conclusion, The present study firstly report  that the rs 174601 SNP is associated with risk  of CAD and IS, and confirm that the T allele and  TT genotype frequencies of the rs174546 SNP  and rs174601 SNP are predominant in Chinese  south population. The T allele, haplotype of T-T  are associated with increased risk of CAD and  IS. Correspondingly, carrying C allele, haplotype  of C-C are associated with reduced risk of CAD  and IS. The two SNPs are likely to influence  serum lipid levels. Carrying T allele carriers and  rs174601 TT genotype are associated with  decreased serum HDL-C and ApoAI in the  patients groups and with an increased risk of  CAD and IS. Further functional investigations  are needed to clarify whether the two SNPs are  functional or not and how they actually affect  the serum lipid levels and risk of CAD and IS.
