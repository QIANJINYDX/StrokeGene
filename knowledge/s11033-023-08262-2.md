# Abstract  

Background   Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic disease with great clinical heterogeneity and few viable strategies for  treatment; hydroxy urea (HU) is the only widely used drug. Thus, the study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and  the gene expression of MMPs 1, 2, 9, 7 and TIMPs 1 and 2, which are involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix,  inflammation, and n europ athies, may provide further insights into the path o physiology of the disease and elucidate biomarkers and molecules as potential therapeutic targets for patients with SCA.  

Methods and results   We evaluated 251 young individuals with SCA from northeastern Brazil. The groups were divided  according to vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and cerebro vascular disease (CVD), compared to control individuals. SNP detection and gene expression assays were performed by real-time PCR, TaqMan system  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$  . Both the expression levels of MMP1  gene, and the SNP MMP1-1607 1G/2G were associated with the risk of cerebral ischemic stroke (IS), and the expression  of MMP1 was also associated with a higher frequency of VOC/year. Expression levels of MMP7, TIMP1, and TIMP2 were  increased in patients conditioned to IS. The SNP   $372\mathrm{T}{>}\mathbf{C}$   (rs4898) TIMP1 T alleles were more frequent in patients with  $>5$    VOC events/year. The SNP rs17576 of MMP9 showed differences in gene expression levels; it was increased in the genotypes AG, and   $\mathrm{AGG+GG}$  .  

Conclusion   The findings of this study, the SNPs, and expression provide initial support for understanding the role of MMPsTIMPs in the path o physiology of SCA in young patients.

# Introduction  

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic disease caused by  an abnormality in the hemoglobin present in erythrocytes,  where there is a substitution of an adenine nitrogen base  for thymine (  $(\mathrm{GAGG}\!\to\!\mathrm{GTG})$  ), resulting in the exchange of  the amino acid glutamic acid for valine at position 6 of the   $\upbeta$  -globin chain [ 1 ,  2 ]. The SCA clinic is extremely variable  and the reasons for this heterogeneity are not fully understood, ranging from almost a symptomatic to clinically severe  forms that are responsible for high mortality, especially  in young people [ 1 ,  3 ,  4 ]. Inflammatory manifestations,  hemolysis, and vascular occlusion arising from changes in  the endothelium, involvement of erythrocytes, granulocytes,  monocytes, and platelets to the endothelium, in addition to  changes in nitric oxide metabolism and oxidative stress, are  the path o physiological characteristics related to most of the  signs and symptoms occurring in patients [ 5 ].  

Cerebral ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the leading causes  of disability in the world. IS is the most serious event in SCA  with a higher chance of causing morbidity and mortality  [ 6 ]. IS usually results from complications of vaso-occlusion  crisis (VOC), and the ischemic type is the most frequent; in  addition, the risk of developing this event can be measured  by trans cranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), which measures  the speed of blood flow; velocities   $(\geq200\,\mathrm{cm/s})$   are considered to pose a high risk of developing IS and, thus, patients  are referred to preventive transfusion therapy [ 7 ,  8 ].  

The vascular alterations found in SCA presents are similar to those that occur in hypertension and atherosclerosis,  e.g., vascular occlusion and change in blood flow pressure  [ 9 ]; for this reason, molecules that control basic cellular  functions and regulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) may  be important in SCA. Thus, metal lo protein as es (MMPs)  and their endogenous tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), which have  not yet been well studied in SCA, may clarify some gaps  in the path o physiology of the disease, because these act in  the mechanism of regulation of homeostasis of the ECM  of humans and influence the activity of other proteases,  cytokines, cell surface ligands, and growth factors [ 10 ,  11 ].  The main functions performed by MMPs-TIMPs are bone  remodeling, wound healing, ang io genesis, cell replacement,  remy eli nation, restoration of connectivity and neuro vascular  integrity, and regulation of inflammatory responses [ 12 ].  

MMPs may play a very important role in the pathophysiology of IS in patients with SCA, i.e., they may enhance  tissue regeneration, which is essential for recovery of an  ischemic injury or accident, on the other hand the MMPs  could increase the blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability,  the down-regulation of cav-1 was correlated with increased  MMP-2 and -9 activities and enhanced BBB permeability.  However, this relationship is not yet fully understood owing  to the multi-functionality of these proteins in addition to  other factors that may affect the performance of MMPs, such  as TIMPs, the chemokine pattern present in tissues, and epigenetic factors [ 13 – 15 ]. Thus, the aim of this study was to  evaluate the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and  the expression of these genes and broaden current knowledge about the role of these molecules in SCA.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study population  

This study was characterized as cross-sectional. We evaluated 251 young SCA patients up to 18 years of age, the  samples were collected by spontaneous demand during  outpatient care from April 2022 to August 2022 at the  Hematology and He mo therapy Foundation of Pernambuco  (HEMOPE), through hemoglobin (Hb) electrophoresis and  high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, BioRad,  Hercules, CA, USA). Within the protocol of this program,  patients are vaccinated against pneumococcus (Pneumo  7—Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., USA) and men in go cocci  (Meningitis c—Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, UK). Also, they  used penicillin (4 U/kg/day) up to 5 years of age; consequently, there was a more homogeneous sample for the  study. The patients’ clinical data were collected from standardized medical records provided by the medical archive of  the HEMOPE Foundation. Patients on hyper transfusion or  transfusion therapy in the last 3 months prior to biological  sample collection were excluded; patients treated in hospitals other than HEMOPE were also excluded to avoid discrepancies in clinical information. Informed consent was  obtained from all individual participants included in the  study and the parents.  

The groups study consisted of SCA patients (HbSS  genotype) divided into the following groups according to  the clinical phenotype: (1) cerebral  $\mathrm{IS+}$   (patients with a history of IS) vs. cerebral  $\mathrm{IS-}$   (patients without history of IS).  (2) High-risk (HR) for IS (rated by trans cranial Doppler  ultrasound-TCD) vs. Conditional (cond.) for IS (rated by  TCD)  vs  Normal (patients without alterations in the TCD).  (3) Cerebro vascular disease   $\mathrm{(CVD+)}$   (patients who had a  history of IS or abnormal TCD values) vs. CVD− (patients  without had a history of IS or abnormal TCD values). 4)   $\mathrm{VOC}\!>\!5$   (patients who presented more than 5 vaso-occlusive events per year) [patients in severe state] vs. VOC 2 to  5 (patients who presented 2 to 5 vaso-occlusive crisis, VOC  events per year) [patients in moderate state] vs.   $\mathrm{VOC}>2$  (patients who presented more than 2 vaso-occlusive crisis  per year) [patients in steady state], Acording Belini Junior,  et al., 2015 [ 16 ]. All primary strokes were confirmed by  baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging. The TCD values  were classified as Normal (less than   $170\,\mathrm{cm/s}$  ); Conditioning  (  $(170{-}199\;\mathrm{cm/s})$  ); High Risk   $(\geq200\:\mathrm{cm/s})$  ) according Adams  et al. [ 17 ].  

# Collection and processing of samples  

Peripheral blood samples were collected by vacuum venous  puncture in Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant. Peripheral blood mono nuclear cells (PBMC) were  obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (Amersham Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). Genomic  DNA extraction from leukocytes was performed using the  phenol–chloroform technique, according Davis et al. [ 18 ].  Total RNA from PBMCs was determined using the extraction method in Trizol (Invitrogen, UK) according to the  manufacturer's instructions.  

# Complementary DNA synthesis (cDNA)  

The total RNA samples were quantified using spectrophotometry technology with the NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific) equipment to measure the concentration of mRNA  and verify contaminants in the sample. To obtain the cDNA  sequences, high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription  (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) was used, according to the  manufacturer's instructions.  

# Detection of polymorphic variants of MMP1, MMP2,  MMP9, TIMP1, and TIMP2 genes  

For detection of  MMP2 -1306 C/T polymorphisms,  rs243865 (C___3225943_10),  MMP2  rs2285053  C/T   $(\mathsf{C}_{--}26734093_{-}20)$  ,  MMP9  C/T, rs17576 

 (C__11655953_10),   $T I M P I+372$   C/T, rs4898 

 (C__11175659_10) and  TIMP2 − 418 G/C, rs7501477 

 (C 26078833 10), we used the real-time PCR, TaqMan  system  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$  . To perform this technique, the Quant i studio 5  equipment (Thermo Scientific, CA, USA) was used at the  Center of Technological Platforms-NPT of the Instituto  Aggeu Magalhães-IAM FioCruz-PE.  

# Expression of genes MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, MMP7,  TIMP1, and TIMP2  

Relative quant if i cation of mRNAs was performed using  the real-time PCR technique, using TaqMan  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   Assays 

 (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), ACTB (Beta-actin gene, 

  $\mathrm{Hz}01060665\mathrm{_g}1)$   technology was used as endogenous  control. The results were analyzed using the comparative  method  $\Delta\Delta\mathrm{CT}\,[2^{(-\Delta\Delta\mathrm{CT})}]$   for relative quant if i cation of gene  expression.  

# Data analysis methods  

Allelic frequencies were estimated by the gene counting  method using the software pLINK v.1.07. The existence of  associations between categorical variables was evaluated by  Pearson's Chi-square tests, or Fisher's exact, when appropriate. The differences were considered as significant for   $\mathtt{p}\!<\!0.05$  . The magnitude of these associations was estimated  as odds ratio (OR), using  $95\%$   confidence intervals. To compare the continuous variables between two groups, either  the t-Student test or the Mann–Whitney non parametric test  was applied, and for comparison between more than two  groups, the ANOVA or the Kruskal–Wallis test was applied,  when appropriate. The GraphPad v.6.0 program. (San Diego,  California, USA) was used for these analyses.

# Results  

# Clinical characteristics of patients  

All individuals with SCA come from northeastern Brazil,  and homozygotes for the HbSS genotype, based on information obtained from medical records. Approximately   $49\%$   of the patients are male and  $51\%$  , female; in addition,  the study sample was composed of young patients with  a mean age of approximately 14 years. Only Hb values  were statistically different between groups:  $\mathrm{IS}+(7.731~\mathrm{g}/$   $\mathrm{{d}L\pm0.8130)}$  ; High Risk TCD   $(7.490~\mathrm{g/dL}\pm0.9714)$  ;  Conditional TCD   $(7.781~\mathrm{g/dL}\pm0.7722)$   and the control  group: Normal TCD   $(8.093~\mathrm{g/dL}\pm0.9232$  ,   $\mathsf{p}\,{=}\,0.0078\$  ).  Hydroxy urea (HU) was also more prevalent in the case  groups compared to the control   $(\mathsf{p}<\r_{0.0001})$  . The other  variables did not show different mean values among the  study groups (Table  1 ).  

# Genotypic frequency of MMP1, MMP2, MMP9,  TIMP1, and TIMP2 genes  

A number of 251 patients were genotyped for SNPs  rs1799750  MMP1 , rs2285053  MMP2 , rs243865  MMP2 ,  rs17576  MMP9 , rs4898  TIMP1  and rs7501477  TIMP2 .  There is variation in   $\mathbf{N}$   between the association groups  because of the lack of information on clinical events in the  patients’ medical records; therefore, some individuals could  not be genotyped. For all SNPs, the distribution of genotypes  in the case and control groups were within the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium,  $\mathtt{p}\!>\!0.05$   (Table SI 1). Only the SNP rs4898  TIMP1  presented a higher allelic T frequency distribution  in the group of patients with  $\mathrm{VOC}\!>\!5$   events/year compared  to the control group, with  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.757$   (1.042–2.962,   $95\%$  CI),   $(p\!=\!0.0452$  , Table  2 ). Moreover, the 1G/1G genotype  of SNP rs1799750  MMP1  presented higher frequency in the  group of patients at high risk for IS when compared to genotype 1G/2G   $({\tt p}\!=\!0.0278)$  ),   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!3.667$   (1.249–10.76,   $95\%$    CI, Table  3 ). The other SNPs did not present a significant  association between the case and the study control groups.  In the groups of patients with IS and CVD, no significant  differences were found between the frequencies of the SNPs  of the  $M M P s$  -TIM  genes (Tables SI 2, 3).  

# Gene expression MMPs‑TIMPs  

Table  4  shows the fold change values of the gene expression of each case group in comparison to the normal control  group. These data show a more pronounced gene expression  of  MMP1  when compared to the others, with a fold change  of 3.32 in comparison to the control group (Table  4 ).

The p values were considered significant when  $<\!0.05$   (show in bold italics), and the tests applied for the  analyses were: Kruskal–Wallis and Chi-square  $I S+$   patients with a history of stroke,   $H R$   patients at high risk for IS,  Cond . patients conditioning for IS,  Hb hemoglobin,   $G O T$  glutamate-oxalate-trans a minas e,  GPT  glutamate-pyruvate trans a minas e,  BT  total biliru- bin,  $H U$   hydroxy urea  

The expression levels of  the MMP1, MMP2, MMP7,  MMP9, TIMP1 ,  and TIMP2  genes were measured by  qPCR of the PBMC of HbSS homozygotes patients, with  a history or risk of cerebral IS, and in patients with a history of VOC, compared to patients without clinical/control manifestation. An overview of the genic expression is  shown in the heatmap of Fig.  1 .  

Regarding the expression of   $M M P s–T I M P s$   genes in  patients with SCA and CVD, there was a significant difference in the expression of the  MMP1  gene with higher  levels of expression in individuals with CVD compared to  control patients,  $p\!=\!0.0002$   (Fig.  2 ).  

When evaluating only patients with a history of IS  compared to patients without IS, the  MMP1  gene showed  higher expression in patients with history of IS,  $p\!=\!0.0269$  (Fig.  3 ).  

The expression levels of  MMPs-TIMPs  genes were also  measured in patients at risk of developing IS. The  MMP1 gene was more expressed in the groups of patients with conditional TCD for IS,   $\mathtt{p}\!=\!0.0016$  , and a higher expression  was also found in patients at high risk for IS,  $p\!=\!0.0419$  .  The genes  MMP7  and  TIMP1 and TIMP2  were also more  expressed in patients at risk for IS,  $p\!=\!0.0141$   and 0.0262,  0.0021, respectively (Fig.  3 ). The  MMP2  and  MMP9  genes  did not show significant differences in expression levels in  these groups.  

In patients with a history of VOC, only the expression  of the  MMP1  gene was significantly increased in patients  with  $\geq2$   VOC/year, compared to patients with  $<2$   events/ year,  $p\!=\!0.0262$   (Fig.  2 ). The other   $M M P s–T I M P s$   genes  were not associated with VOC in the study groups.  

We also evaluated the expression of  $M M P s–T I M P s$   among  the groups of patients who use HU compared to those who  do not use it, to analyze whether HU interferes with the  expression levels of these genes, but there was no association  of the expression of these genes when HU was used (Fig  SI 1).  

Evaluations were made of the levels of gene expression  among the genotypes of each SNP of this study. Only the  SNP rs17576 of  MMP9  showed significant differences in  genic expression among genotypes, where genotype AG,   $p\!=\!0.0135$  , and   $\mathrm{AGG+GG}$  ,  $p\!=\!0.0065$  , showed higher levels  of expression when compared to genotype AA (Fig.  4 ). The  other genes did not show a relationship between genotypes  and gene expression. The study of the correlation between   $M M P s$   and   $T I M P s$   showed no relationship between these  genes in the patients of this study (Fig SI 1).  

# Discussion  

To our knowledge, this was the first study to evaluate SNPs  and expression of MPPs genes and their TIMP inhibitors  in young patients with cerebro vascular and vaso-occlusive  manifestations. The expression levels of the  MMP1  gene  were higher in patients with CVD, and a history of IS,  patients with changes in TCD, and individuals with  $\geq2$  VOC events/year compared to patients without these  manifestations. According to Ito et al. [ 19 ] in endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) present in peripheral  blood, the differential expression indicated over expression  of the  MMP1  gene in ECFCs of adults with SCA and IS  [ 19 ]. The functional hypothesis in MMP1 in SCA involves  the process of ang io genesis—an important event in SCA  which can be regulated by MMP1. There are reports that  ang io genesis contributes to neurological repair involving  the remodeling of the ECM [ 19 – 21 ]. MMP1 is secreted  by macrophages during the inflammatory process digesting elastin and degrading the basal membrane [ 22 ]. In  the literature, there are previous reports of the action of

this molecule also in inflammatory diseases [ 19 ,  23 ]; for  example, in at hero sclerotic stroke, it acts in the migration  of vascular smooth muscle cells, differentiation of monocytes, and collagen degradation types I, II and III [ 24 – 26 ].  

As chronic inflammation is a key event in SCA we indicate  studies that correlate MMP1 with inflammatory markers in  SCA. Furthermore, we believe that high levels of MMP1  may be associated with excessive degradation of the ECM

and maintenance of chronic inflammation, which would be  harmful to patients with SCA.  

About  $90\%$   of cerebral ISs can be avoided with preventive  blood transfusion therapy in patients with high flow detected  by TCD, but the risk of IS reappears when transfusion therapy is discontinued [ 17 ,  27 ]. In addition, as patients grow  older, their skull matures, and it becomes more difficult to  screen them for TCD; for this reason, other risk factors need  to be detected to complement the use of TCD screening,  with a view to increasing chance of preventing IS [ 27 ]. In  this study, MMP1 stands out as a promising molecule for  this purpose.  

We found that the 1G/1G genotype of the  MMP1  gene  was more frequent in patients at high risk for IS compared  to genotype 1G/2G,  $\mathtt{p}\!=\!0.0278$  ,  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!3.667$   (1.249–10.76,   $95\%$   CI). However, these findings are still very preliminary  and require further studies to confirm and understand the  effect of this SNP on the disease. We found no association  between SNP and  MMP1  expression levels, but it could be  seen that in fibroblast, melanoma, and endo the li al cells of  the human umbilical vein, the presence of the 2G allele is  associated with higher levels of MMP1 [ 28 ,  29 ]. In addition  to SNP, other factors may regulate gene expression levels,  such as circular RNAs, miRNAs, other proteases, cytokines,  cell surface ligands, and growth factors [ 10 ,  11 ,  30 ], and this  may be one of the reasons why there was no relationship  between SNP and gene expression in this study.  

Gene expression of  MMP7  was also increased in patients  at risk of developing brain IS. According to a study in The  Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), MMP7 levels were significantly increased in individuals with several types of cancers [ 31 ]. In cancer, the role of this molecule is linked to  the degradation of casein, fi bron ect in, collagen and proteoglycans. Therefore, it has an influence on the genesis and

development of tumors, reduction of cell formation, inhibition of apoptosis and onset of vas cul o genesis [ 31 ,  32 ].  In the elderly in Sweden, circulating levels of MMP7 were  independently associated with cerebral IS; thus, this molecule can be seen as a risk factor and a possible marker  for cerebral IS [ 33 ]. Although there are few studies on this  MMP, it may play an important role in the regulation of  the ECM and inflammation in the IS of SCA individuals,  because in patients with cardiovascular disease, MMP7 levels were increased in comparison to control individuals, and  MMP7 can activate pro-MMP8 in MMP8, especially in the  inflammatory process of cardiovascular disease [ 34 ].  

In this study, the SNP rs17576 of MMP9 showed significant differences in gene expression among genotypes;  genotype AG,  $\mathsf{p\!=\!0.0135}$  , and   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{AC}+\mathrm{CG}$  ,  $\mathsf{p\!=\!0.0065}$  , showed  higher levels of expression of the  MMP9  gene when  compared to genotype AA. No previous studies have shown  an association of this SNP with the mRNA expression levels  of the  MMP9  gene. However, it was found that the variant G  allele is associated with increased levels of MMP9 in plasma  in patients with cardiovascular disease [ 35 – 37 ].  

Zielińska-Turek et al. [ 38 ] reported increased levels of  MMP9 in patients with IS compared to patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [ 38 ]. Cai et al. [ 39 ], in their study  with male Sprague–Dawley rats submitted to the model of  occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO), found that  MMP9 expression levels were significantly higher in these  animals. This author further suggested that inhibition of  MMP9 can protect the integrity of the BBB by preserving  proteins from tight junction proteins in ischemic brain injury  [ 39 ]. Thus, the relationship of this molecule in brain disease is due to the fact that MMP9 acts on type IV collagen,

fi bron ect in, and laminin, the main components of the basal  lamina, i.e., it has an influence on the late opening of the  BBB after ischemic brain injury [ 14 ]. Therefore, we do not  rule out the importance of new studies involving this MMP  and its potential as a marker and even therapeutic target for  SCA.  

In this study, only the SNP  $372\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$   (Phe124Phe; rs4898)  TIMP1  presented a higher allelic T frequency distribution  in the group of patients with   $\mathrm{VOC}\!>\!5$   events/year compared to the control group with less than 2 events/year, with   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.757$   (1.042–2.962,  $95\%$   CI,  $\mathtt{p}\!=\!0.0452)$  ). This was the  first study to evaluate this SNP in SCA individuals. VOC is  one of the events responsible for triggering most signs and  symptoms in patients with SCA, including cerebral IS [ 40 ].  However, the effects of this SNP on the expression of the  TIMP1  gene are unknown, and we did not find a relationship  between the SNP and the gene expression of  TIMP1 .  

We also found that the  TIMP1  gene was more expressed  in patients at risk for cerebral IS,  $\mathtt{p}\!=\!0.0262$  . In patients  with IS and stenosis  $\ge70\%$  , TIMP1 levels were higher than  in patients after end art erect o my; this finding points out  that this may be a good predictive factor for cerebral IS  [ 38 ]. The function of TIMP1 in brain disease is related  to inhibition of MMP9 activity [ 41 ]. In their study of   $\mathrm{Nu}$    et al. [ 41 ] with rats, the injection of recombinant human  TIMP1 (rhTIMP1,   $1.60\,\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{kg}/36\,\mathrm{h})$  ) decreased the expression and activation of MMP9 in the cortex, and thereby  decreased IS, indicating that direct inhibition of activation  of MMP9 via exogenous rhTIMP1 exerts a neuro protective  effect against stroke in cold-induced rats, and eases the  imbalance between MMP9 and TIMP1 [ 41 ]. Intravenous  injection of TIMP1 nanoparticles [ 42 ], TIMP1 injected  TIMP1-cDNA plasmids [ 43 ], helped maintain blood barrier integrity by increasing TIMP1 levels in the central  nervous system.  

In this study, the  TIMP2  gene was also more expressed in  group with patients conditioning to cerebral IS,  $\mathtt{p}\!=\!0.0021$  .  In resistant arterial hypertension, plasma TIMP2 levels  were also increased, suggesting unbalanced MMP2 activity in hypertension [ 44 ]. In CVDs, according to the current  literature, the imbalance between TIMP2 and MMP2 was  related to remodeling and vascular dysfunction [ 45 ], hemorrhagic transformation after cerebral ischemia [ 46 ], cerebral  aneurysm [ 47 ] and rupture of the BBB [ 48 ].  

Some limitations can be pointed out in this study; for  example, the small number of patients, when some groups  are stratified. The number of cases was greatly reduced  compared to controls; aspects as robust exclusion criteria,  such as hyper transfusion therapy for patients at high risk for  stroke, caused the sample size to be reduced. Therefore, we  recommend new studies including functional experimental  studies with knockout genes for  $M M P s–T I M P s$  .  

# Conclusion  

The  MMP1  gene, both the SNP MMP1-1607 1G/2G and the  expression levels were associated with the risk of IS; the  expression of gene  MMP1  was also associated with higher  frequency of VOC/year. Expression levels of  MMP7, TIMP1   and  TIMP2  were increased in patients conditioning to cerebral IS. The SNP   $372\mathrm{T}{>}\mathrm{C}$   (rs4898)  TIMP1  T allele was  more frequent in patients with  $>5$   VOC events/year. The  SNP rs17576 of  MMP9  showed differences in gene expression levels, i.e., it was increased in the genotypes AG, and   $\mathrm{AGG+G G}$  . The findings of this study, provide initial support  for an understanding of the role of MMPs-TIMPs in the  path o physiology of SCA in young patients and indicate them  as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
