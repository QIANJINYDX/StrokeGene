Abstract  MicroRNAs are a recently discovered class of small noncoding RNA, which play key roles in every aspect of brain function, including neural development and neuro genesis. Since abnormal expression and function of microRNAs has been observed in ischemic stroke, we evaluated whether genetic variations in microRNAs can influence the clinical behavior of ischemic stroke. Common functional microRNA SNPs (i.e., miR-146a rs2910164, miR-149 rs2292832, miR-196a2 rs11614913, miR-499 rs3746444, miR-605 rs2043556, and miR-618 rs2682818) were genotyped in 914 patients with ischemic stroke. MicroRNAs variants were not associated with age of ischemic stroke onset  $(P\!>\!0.05)$  . However, we found that miR-618 rs2682818 GT/TT genotypes were significantly associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke recurrence, compared with the GG genotype (hazard ratio   $[\mathrm{HR}]\,{=}\,1.72$  ;   $95\ \%$  confidential interval [CI], 1.08 to 2.74; log-rank  $P\!=\!0.006$  ), and this effect was more pronounced among subjects with small-vessel disease   $(\mathrm{HR}\!=\!2.60$  ;  $95\ \%$   CI, 1.11 to 6.08; log-rank    $P\!=\!0.007]$  ). Moreover, the variant genotypes (GT/TT) of rs2682818 were an independent prognostic factor for ischemic stroke in the multivariate Cox regression model. Our findings suggest that miR618 SNP rs2682818 may play an important role in the recurrence of ischemic stroke.

# Introduction  

Although common risk factors such as hypertension and tobacco smoking account for substantial parts of ischemic stroke risk [ 1 ,  2 ], much remains unknown. MicroRNAs are a recently discovered class of small noncoding RNA. MicroRNAs are RNA molecules composed of    ${\sim}22$   nucleotides that modulate protein expression levels by antagonizing mRNA translation and have crucial roles in normal central nervous system development and function [ 3 ]. MicroRNAs play key roles in every aspect of brain function, including neural development and neuro genesis [ 4 ,  5 ].  

The exact mechanisms regulating expression and maturation of microRNA are still not fully understood. Recent studies have suggested that genetic alterations may play key roles in this process [ 6 ]. In recent years, four well-known microRNA polymorphisms (rs2910164, rs11614913, rs2292832, and rs3746444 in miR-146a, miR-196a2, miR-149, and miR-499, respectively) have been investigated in various human diseases and are considered as possible genetic predisposing biomarkers [ 7 – 9 ]. Recently, another two functional microRNA polymorphisms (rs2682818 and rs2043556 in miR-618 and miR-605, respectively) were also reported [ 10 ,  11 ]. These microRNA polymorphisms may alter microRNA processing and expression. Moreover, these variants could affect vascular damage responses and are associated with regulation of C-reactive protein and methylene tetra hydro folate reductase [ 12 – 14 ].  

Previous studies showed that genetic variants in microRNAs were associated with stroke susceptibility [ 15 – 17 ]. However, the roles of microRNA polymorphisms in stroke onset and prognosis remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted a cohort study to assess the association between these microRNA polymorphisms and the clinical behavior of ischemic stroke in a Chinese population.  

# Methods  

# Study Subjects  

All participants gave informed consent and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Jinling Hospital (Nanjing, China). Details about subject recruitment have been described previously [ 18 ]. Patients ’  characteristics and clinical feathers are shown in Table  1 . Follow-up was done every 3 months by telephone or clinical visit until stroke recurrence or the last follow-up period (November 2013).

# Genotyping  

The microRNA polymorphisms were detected by Improved Multiple Ligase Detection Reaction (iMLDR) [ 19 ], with technical support from Center for Human Genetics Research, Shanghai Genesky Biotechnology Company. Quality control was done according to the criteria described previously [ 20 ].  

# Statistical Analyses  

Differences in the average age at disease onset were evaluated using one-way ANOVA. The recurrence-time curves were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons were computed by the log-rank test. Cox proportion hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and their   $95\ \%$   confidential intervals (CIs) for predicting factors of stroke recurrence. All of the statistical analyses were performed by the STATA (version 13.0), SAS (version 9.1.3) and   $\mathrm{R}$   software (version 2.13.0).  

# Results  

# MicroRNAs Polymorphisms and Stroke Onset  

A total of 914 patients were included in present study. As shown in Fig.  1 , none of microRNAs polymorphisms was associated with the age of stroke onset   $(P\!>\!0.05)$  , indicating that these microRNAs variants were not related to age of disease onset.  

# MicroRNAs Polymorphisms and Stroke Recurrence  

The median follow-up time was 25.93 months. During the follow-up period, 853 patients had complete follow-ups data, and 74 had recurrent stroke. Consistently, factors significantly associated with stroke recurrence were age and hypertension (Table  1 ). The association between microRNA polymorphisms and recurrence of ischemic stroke is shown in Table  2 . Among these microRNA polymorphisms, only miR-618 rs2682818 was significantly associated with recurrence risk in dominant model (log-rank  $P\!=\!0.006$  ; Fig.  2 ). Cox regression analysis showed that the GT/TT genotypes were significantly unfavorable prognostic factor for stroke recurrence   $(\mathrm{HR}\!=\!1.72$  ,   $95~\%$   CI, 1.08 – 2.74), compared with GG genotype (Table  2 ).  

# Stratified Analysis  

When we conducted stratified analysis by age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, and stroke subtype, we

found that the increased recurrence risk of the variant genotypes of miR-618 rs2682818 was more prominent among subjects with small-vessel disease (SVD) subtype (  $(\mathrm{HR}\!=\!2.60$  ;  $95\ \%$   CI, 1.11 – 6.08; Table  3  and Fig.  2 ). Furthermore,

multivariate Cox regression analysis also indicated that the miR-618 rs2682818 is an independent prognostic factor for ischemic stroke recurrence   $\scriptstyle P=0.023$  ; Table  4 ).  

# Discussion  

In this study, we investigated whether genetic variants in microRNAs were associated with onset and recurrence of ischemic stroke in a Chinese population. Our results showed that miR-618 rs2682818 was significantly associated with risk of stroke recurrence, especially for the SVD subtype. In addition, the variant genotype of miR-618 rs2682818 was an independent prognostic factor for ischemic stroke in the multivariate Cox regression analysis.  

MicroRNAs play key roles in various physiological and pathological processes. Increasing evidence has shown that circulating microRNA may be important biomarkers of stroke diagnosis and prognosis [ 21 ,  22 ]. Polymorphisms/mutations and abnormal expression/ processing of microRNAs are likely to contribute to stroke outcome. Genetic variants in the microRNA have been reported to be associated with prognosis of complex diseases such as coronary artery disease and cancer [ 7 ,  23 ]. However, the association between microRNA polymorphisms and stroke recurrence is still unclear. Therefore, the common variants in microRNA genes (miR-146a rs2910164, miR-149 rs2292832, miR-196a2 rs11614913, miR-499 rs3746444, miR-605 rs2043556, and miR-618 rs2682818) were assessed in our present study. We found that ischemic stroke patients carrying the variant genotypes of miR-618 rs2682818 had a worse prognosis.  

MiR-618 rs2682818 is located within the stem-loop sequence of the miR-618 precursor. This variant could affect miR-618 expression by interfering with the formation of the secondary stem-loop structure and processing of pre-miR-618 to its mature form [ 10 ].

In vitro study showed that the T allele of rs2682818 had significantly lower level of mature miR-618 compared with G allele [ 10 ], suggesting that this functional SNP may affect the process of miR-618, which in turn influence multiple downstream signals. The above findings

suggest that the variant T allele of rs2682818 may interfere with stem-loop formation and expression/ processing of miR-618. Individuals with the variant allele may have lower levels of miR-618, which is expected to have higher expression of target genes, thus increasing recurrence risk of ischemic stroke.  

Major strengths of the current study were its prospective design. Moreover, our finding is biologically plausible in consideration of the putative function of the genetic variant in microRNA. The present study also has several limitations. First, our study population comprised only Chinese subjects. Thus, the findings need to be further validated in other populations. Second, the biological mechanisms of the polymorphisms, their related microRNAs as well as their target genes in the regulation of stroke recurrence are still not clear, which needs more in vitro and in vivo studies.  

In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-618 SNP rs2682818 may play an important role in ischemic stroke recurrence. More research is warranted to verify the findings and explore the potential mechanisms.
