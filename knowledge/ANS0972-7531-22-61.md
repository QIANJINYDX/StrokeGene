Ischaemic stroke Inflammatory gene Single nucleotide Polymorphisms Interleukin-6 Cytokine Meta-analysis  

Background:  Interleukin-6 (IL-6), as one of the most typical pro-inflammatory and immuno regulatory cytokines, is believed to be associated with the genesis and maintenance of inflammatory response. Genetic  association studies (GAS) that have investigated the association between Interleukin 6 (G174C and G572C)  promoter gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to ischemic stroke (IS) which have produced contradictory and unconvincing results.  

Purpose:  The aim of this meta-analysis is to provide a relatively comprehensive account of the association  of IL-6 (G174C and G572C) polymorphisms with susceptibility to IS. Methods:  A literature search was conducted using electronic database PubMed, Medline, and Trip database for all case-control studies investigating for association of IL-6 genetic polymorphisms with ischemic  stroke published till August 30, 2014. The following combinations of main keywords were used: (‘Interleukin-6’ or ‘IL-6’) and (‘ischaemic stroke or ‘cerebral infarction’ or ‘IS’) and (‘genetic polymorphism’ or ‘single  nucleotide polymorphisms’ or ‘SNP’). Pooled Odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) were  determined for IL-6 gene-disease association. Meta-analysis was carried out using Revman 5.3 software. Results:   16 case-control studies involving a total of 3,317 IS patients and 3,432 healthy controls for G174C  polymorphism and 3 case-control studies with a total of 2,001 IS patients and 2,027 healthy controls for  G572C IL-6 gene polymorphisms were included in a meta-analysis. For IL-6 G174C gene polymorphisms,  no significant association was observed under dominant [G  $\mathsf{i C}+\mathsf{C C}$  vs. GG:   $\mathsf{O R}=1.01$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.77–1.34,   ${\mathsf{P}}=0$  . 92], recessive [CC vs. GG  +  GC:  $\mathsf{O R}=0.82\$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.40–1.70,  ${\mathsf{P}}=0$  . 59] and allelic model [C vs. G  Allele:   $\mathsf{O R}=0.99$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.74–1.31,   ${\mathsf{P}}=0$  . 93]. For IL-6 G572C, no significant association was observed  under dominant [CC vs. GG  $^+$   GC:   $\mathsf{O R}=0.99$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.57–1.71,  ${\mathsf{P}}=0$  . 97], recessive [CC vs. GG  +  GC:   $\mathsf{O R}=0.93$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.60–1.45,  $\mathsf{P}=0$  . 75] and allelic model [C vs.  $\sf G$  Allele:   $\mathsf{O R}=0.95$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.66–1.36,   ${\mathsf{P}}=0$  . 76].

the increased level of IL-6.  The levels of IL-6 were found to be  increased in both serum and cerebro-spinal fluid after ischemic  stroke, and elevated IL-6 levels have been associated with greater stroke severity, larger final infarct volume, early neurological  worsening, and worse functional outcome.

Introduction  

Stroke is the third leading cause of death  worldwide after Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)  and Cancer. Stroke has accounted for nearly  5.7 million deaths worldwide,  $87\%$   of these  deaths occur in low and middle income  countries.  Incidence of stroke in South Asian  countries has increased by more than   $100\%,$  ,  

Numerous studies have investigated the association of IL-6  G174C and G572C gene polymorphisms in relation to various  ischaemic and at hero sclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Associations have been reported between the   $_{G G}$    genotype and asymptomatic carotid artery atherosclerosis,  risk of coronary  heart disease,  peripheral arterial occlusive disease,  multiinfarct dementia,  and longer hospital and intensive care unit  stay after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  However, other studies have found associations between the  CC  genotype  and a symptomatic carotid artery atherosclerosis and increased  mortality among abdominal aortic aneurysm patients.  Reasons for these contradictory findings are unclear.  

while this is decreased by  $42\%$   in developed European countries  in last four decades.  Ischaemic stroke (IS) accounts for  $85\%$   of  stroke and its path o physiology are regulated by a combination  of lifestyle, environmental and unclear genetic risk factors.  Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the  pathogen es is of ischemic stroke.  Candidate genes, stroke sus- ce pti bil it y alleles and their association with stroke pathogen es is  have been intensely studied in the last few years.  

Human Interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene is located at chromosome 7p21  which consists of 5 exons and 4 introns and synthesized as a  precursor protein of 232 amino acids.  IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease  that may also be a key mediator in the inflammatory response  to ischemic stroke.  Two functional promoter polymorphisms,  G174C and G572C have been identified in the IL-6 promoter  region and these two genetic variants may be associated with  

Inflammation and ischemic stroke are interrelated as many  studies suggest that IL-6 may play a central role in the inflammatory response to cerebral ischemia.  However, although  the role of IL-6 in ischemic stroke has been extensively studied, the influence of IL-6 genetic polymorphisms on stroke is  not well understood. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to  summarize the studies that have examined the IL-6 (G174C and  G572C) polymorphism in relation to ischemic stroke and to discuss the implications of these results for future research.  

Methods  

# Identification of Relevant Studies  

A literature search for GAS that investigated the association  between the IL-6 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to IS  published before August 30, 2014 which was conducted in the  following electronic databases: PubMed, Medline and trip databases. The following combinations of main keywords were  used: (‘Interleukin $\cdot6^{\prime}$   or ‘IL-6’) and (‘ischaemic stroke or ‘cerebral infarction’ or ‘IS’) and (‘genetic polymorphism’ or ‘single  nucleotide polymorphisms’ or ‘SNP’). The search was done  without limitations on language, but only included those studies that were conducted on human subjects. All references in  eligible articles were extensively reviewed to identify additional  published articles.  

# Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  

To be included in the analysis, eligible studies had to meet the  following criteria: (a) case-control studies on the association  between the IL-6 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to IS;  (b) all patients in the candidate studies meet the diagnostic criteria for IS; (c) studies with sufficient available data to calculate  Odds Ratios (ORs) with corresponding   $95\%$   Confidence intervals (CIs). The major reason for excluding studies were: (i) not  case-control study; (ii) duplicates publications with overlapping  subjects from the same study; and (iii) no available data reported. For multiple studies using overlapping cases or controls, the  most recent study with the largest sample size was included in  the meta-analysis. This meta analysis was conducted according  to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines with only slight modification, and did not require ethics board approval.  

# Data Extraction  

According to the PRISMA guidelines, two investigators independently PK and AKY checked each full-text report for eligibility  and extracted the following data from eligible studies: surname  of first author, year of publication, country of origin, ethnicity,  number of case and control, age, sex ratio, genotyping method,  allele and genotype frequency etc. Disagreements were solved  by discussion between all authors until consensus was reached.  

# Quality Assessment  

Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) criteria 45  were used to assess the  qualities of all included studies. The NOS criteria use a ‘‘star’’  rating system to judge methodological quality based on three  aspects of a study: selection, comparability, and exposure.  Scores range from 0 stars (worst) to 9 stars (best), with a score  of 5 or higher indicating a moderate-high methodological  quality. Two authors independently assessed the quality of included studies. Discrepancies over quality scores were resolved  by discussion with all authors and subsequent consensus.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Genotype distributions in the controls were tested for conformation to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using the chisquare test. HWE in the controls was tested by comparing the  expected and observed genotype frequencies using the Pearson  chi-square test for goodness of fit. The association between the  IL-6 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to IS was assessed  by the pooled odds ratios (ORs) with their corresponding   $95\%$    confidence intervals   $(95\%\mathsf{C l s})$   under three genetic models, including dominant, recessive and allelic model. Taking into consideration possible between-study heterogeneity, a statistical  test for heterogeneity was first conducted using Cochran’s Q  statistic and the I 2  metric. We considered the presence of significant heterogeneity at the   $10\%$   level of significance and values  of I 2  exceeding   $50\%$   as an indicator of significant heterogeneity. When no heterogeneity was found with P.0.10 or   $|^{2}<50\%,$  ,  a fixed-effects model was used to estimate the pooled ORs and   $95\%\mathsf{C l s}$  . Otherwise, a random-effects model was applied. In  addition to an overall comparison, stratified analyses, based  on ethnicity, source of control, HWE status, and genotyping  method where applicable, were also performed to explore possible explanations of between-study heterogeneity and to investigate whether overall reported associations were present in  subgroups. Begg’s funnel plot was used to assess the potential  for publication bias.  

Results  

Figure-1 represents a flow diagram of retrieved and excluded  studies with their reasons for exclusion. A total of 285 relevant  papers were identified using the pre-specified search strategy.  In accordance with the inclusion criteria, 16 case-control studies were included for IL-6 G174C with a total of 3317 IS patients and 3482 healthy controls and 3 case control studies for  IL-6 G572C with a total of 1814 IS patients and 3219 healthy  controls in this meta-analysis. For IL-6 G174C, studies were conducted in two major ethnic populations, with nine including  Asians and seven as Caucasians. The publication duration of  included studies ranged from 2002 to 2014. The characteristics  and methodological quality of all included studies are summarized in Table-1.  

# Association between the IL-6 G174C Polymorphism and   Susceptibility to IS  

Sixteen case-control studies 28–38  investigated the relationship  between G174C and susceptibility to IS with a total of 3317 IS  patients and 3432 healthy controls. Since between-study heterogeneity obviously existed (  $\mathsf{P}\!<\!0.10$   and  $|^{2}>\!50\%$   under all genetic models), the random-effect model was used. As shown in  Figure-2, no significant association was found under dominant

Based on an ethnicity stratification analysis, a  significant association was observed under a dominant model  [GC  +  CC vs. GG:  $\mathsf{O R}=1.34$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.10–1.62,  $\mathsf{P}=0$  . 003] in  Asians, but not in Caucasians   $\mathsf{\Gamma}_{\mathsf{G C}\,+\,\mathsf{C C}}$   vs. GG:  $\mathsf{O R}=0.81$  ,  $95\%$  CI: 0.55–1.21,  $\mathsf{P}=0$  . 31] studies (Figure-3).  

Begg’s funnel plots were used to assess the potential publication bias of included Asian studies under a dominant model for  IL-6 G174C SNPs. The shapes of the funnel plots did not reveal  any evidence of obvious asymmetry (Figure-4).  

Association between the IL-6 G572C Polymorphism and   Susceptibility to IS  

Three case-control studies had investigated the relationship  between   $\mathsf{G572C}^{28,30,41}$   and susceptibility to IS with a total of  1814 IS patients and 3219 healthy controls. Since betweenstudy heterogeneity obviously existed   $(\mathsf{P}\!<\!0.10$   and   $|^{2}\ >\,50\%$  under all genetic models), the random-effects model was used.  Overall, the IL-6 G572C polymorphism was not significantly associated with the susceptibility of IS under dominant   $\mathsf{\Gamma}_{\mathsf{G C}\,+\,}\mathsf{C C}$  vs. GG:  $\mathsf{O R}=0.99$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.57–1.71,  $\mathsf{P}=0$  . 97], recessive [CC  vs.   $\mathsf{G G}+\mathsf{G C}$  :   $\mathsf{O R}\,=\,0.93$  ,   $95\%$   CI:  $0.60{-}1.45$  ,   $\mathsf{P}\,=\,0$  . 75] and   allelic model [C vs. G Allele:   $\mathsf{O R}\,=\,0.95$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.66–1.36,    $\mathsf{P}=0.76\mathsf{I}$    ( Figure-5 ) .  

Discussion  

This study was designed to advance the understanding of association between the IL-6 G174C and G572C gene polymorphism  and risk of ischaemic stroke. In this meta-analysis, 17 studies  (16 studies for G174C, 3 studies for G572C) on IL-6 polymorphisms were performed to provide the most comprehensive assessment of the association between the polymorphisms and  IS risk. Our data did not support a genetic association between  the polymorphisms and IS risk in populations.  

This meta-analysis must be interpreted with caution because of  certain limitations. First, the outcomes were based on individual unadjusted ORs, whereas a more precise evaluation should  be adjusted by potentially suspected factors, including age,  gender, smoking status, and environmental factors. Second,  these estimations were obtained by pooling the studies with  regard to heterogeneity. However, heterogeneity provided the  opportunity to identify factors that modified the genotype. Our  meta analysis show heterogeneity except in dominant model of  quality studies and some of the factors identified are age, sex,  quality of studies and risk factors for ischaemic stroke which  could not be stratified in our meta analysis due to lack of raw  data in studies. Pooling studies with different results lead to a  high degree of heterogeneity, but might result in hazardous or  invalid estimates. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that  the results were biased because of undetected stratification in  the original case–control samples.

In summary, the present meta-analyses did not infer that Ischaemic stroke is a complex multi factorial disease, in addition to  genetic factors, environmental factors also play an important  role in IS aetiology. Thus, this discrepancy may also be caused  by varying geographical distribution, linked to climate, diet,  life- style and economic status.  

In summary, the present meta-analyses did not support a prominent association of the IL-6 promoter polymorphisms (G174C  and G572C) with IS risk. However, the G174C polymorphism  might be associated with IS in Asian studies based on sampled studies. More convincing evidence is required to conclude  about the relation between these polymorphisms and risk of IS.  

# Conclusion  

Well designed studies are needed to investigate the association  of polymorphisms in IL6 larger and various ancestry populations.
