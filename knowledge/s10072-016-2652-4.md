Abstract  The aim of this study was to investigate the association between CYP1A1 gene polymorphism and ischaemic stroke (IS) risk, and the impact of gene–gene interaction on IS risk based on a Chinese Han case–control study. A total of 1162 subjects (612 men and 550 women), with a mean age of   $63.1\pm12.5$   years old, were selected, including 580 IS patients and 582 normal controls. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and IS risk, and generalized multi factor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to analyze the gene–gene interaction. Logistic regression analysis showed that the frequency for rs4646903 minor alleles was lower in cases than that in normal controls, and C allele of rs4646903 was  $20.7~\%$   in ischemic stroke cases and   $27.1\ \%$   in controls subjects  $(p<0.001)$  . Logistic analysis showed the signiﬁcant association between genotypes of variants in rs4646903 and decreased ischemic stroke risk. GMDR analysis indicated that there was a signiﬁcant two-locus model  $(p=0.0107)$  ) involving rs4646903 and rs1048943, indicating a potential gene–gene interaction between rs4646903 and rs1048943. Overall, the two- locus models had a cross-validation consistency of 9 of 10, and had the testing accuracy of   $60.72~\%$  . Subjects with TC or CC of rs4646903 and AG or GG of rs1048943 genotype have lowest ischemic stroke risk, compared to subjects with TT of rs4646903 and AA of rs1048943 genotype, and OR (  $95~\%$   CI) was 0.63 (0.42–0.89). rs4646903 minor alleles and interaction between rs4646903 and rs1048943 were associated with decreased IS risk.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide was responsible for 5.7 million deaths worldwide in 2005 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [ 1 ,  2 ]. Compared with hae mor rha gic stroke, ischaemic stroke (IS) is more common and accounts for about   $80\ \%$   of stroke cases [ 3 – 5 ].Conventional risk factors for stroke include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and excessive drinking [ 6 ]. In addition, genetic factors play a vital role. Many candidate genes have been reported for their potential roles in IS [ 7 – 9 ].  

Cytochrome P450s are the enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of steroids, fatty acids, prostaglandins, biogenic amines, and plant metabolites [ 10 ]. The human gene cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1), which located on chromosome 15q22–q24, is 5987-bp long, and encodes a 512-amino acid protein, is expressed in the vascular endothelium. Several important single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identiﬁed in the CYP1A1 locus. The CYP1A1m1 allele has a   ${\mathrm{~T~}\rightarrow\mathrm{~C~}}$   mutation in the   $3^{\prime}$    non-coding region, which has been associated with elevated enzyme activity [ 11 ,  12 ]. Lanca et al. [ 13 ] indicated that CYP1A1 polymorphism is involved in the production of arachidonic acid-derived vasoactive substances, and it has been suggested that there exists a relationship between CYP1A1 activity and incidence of stroke in patients with essential hypertension. The multiple genotypes were result of many SNP and multiple gene–gene interactions. Until now, however, no study focused on the impact of CYP1A1 gene polymorphism and gene–gene interactions on IS risk in Chinese population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between CYP1A1 gene polymorphism and IS risk, and the impact of gene–gene interaction on IS risk based on a Chinese Han case–control study.  

# Materials and methods  

# Subjects  

This was a case–control study. Participants were consecutively recruited between June 2012 and July 2014 from the afﬁliated college Shenzhen Second People’s Hospital. All cases were conﬁrmed by clinical diagnosis, and the IS was diagnosed by the standards of the World Health Organization and International Class i cation; all the cases were diagnosed by the clinical neural function defect performance and head CT or MRI scan [ 14 ]. Secondary stroke patients caused by valvular heart disease, atrial brillat ion, hemopathy, tumor, cerebro vascular malformation, aneurysms, and autoimmune diseases were excluded. Healthy controls were randomly selected from a population screening program for risk factors of stroke in the same regions and 1:1 matched to cases on the basis of age (  $(\pm3$   years) and sex, and subjects with history of stroke were also excluded. At last, a total of 1162 subjects (612 men and 50 women), with a mean age of  $63.1\pm12.5$   years old, were selected, including 580 IS patients and 582 normal controls. Blood samples were collected from each participant. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The protocol of this study was approved by Anhui Medical University.  

# Body measurements  

Data on demographic information, diet, smoking, and drinking information for all participants were obtained using a standard questionnaire administered by trained staffs. We deﬁned currently alcohol consumption as more than one drink of any type per month or not currently drinking as less than one drink of any type per month [ 15 ]; current smokers were deﬁned as those who have smoked for at least 100 cigarettes and still smoked at the time of the interview, individuals with no history of cigarette smoking were considered as never smokers [ 16 ,  17 ]. Body weight, height, and waist circumference were also measured according to standardized procedures [ 18 ]. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. Blood samples were collected in the morning after at least  $^\textrm{\scriptsize8h}$   of fasting. All plasma and serum samples were frozen at    $-80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until laboratory testing.  

# Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping  

Some SNPs of the CYP1A1 gene were selected, including: (1) SNP, which have been reported associations with hypertension, CAD, and stroke; (2) SNP, the minor allele frequency (MAF) of which was greater than   $2~\%$  ; and (3) SNP, which were not well studied in the previous studies. Four SNPs of CYP1A1 were selected for genotyping in the study: rs4646903, rs1048943, rs4646422, and rs2606345. All SNPs were detected by TaqMan u or esc en ce probe. ABI Prism7000 software and allelic discrimination procedure were used for genotyping. Genomic DNA from participants was extracted from EDTA-treated whole blood, using the DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A   $25~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   reaction mixture, including   $1.25~\upmu$   SNP Genotyping Assays   $(20\times)$  ,   $12.5~\upmu$  Genotyping Master Mix   $(2\times)$  , and   $20\;\mathrm{ng}$   DNA, and the conditions were as follows: initial de natura tion for   $10\ \mathrm{min}$  and  $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , de natura tion for   $15~\mathrm{s}$   and  $92~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , and annealing and extension for   $90~\mathrm{s}$   and   $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , 50 cycles. Probe sequences of all SNPs were shown in Table  1 .  

# Statistical analysis  

The mean and SD for normally distributed continuous variables, and percentages for categorical variable, were calculated and compared. The genotype and allele frequencies were obtained by direct count. The categorical data were analyzed using  $\chi^{2}$    test. Furthermore, continuous variables were analyzed using Student’s    $t$   test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by the least signiﬁcant difference multiple-range tests for comparison between groups. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was performed using SNPStats (available online at  http://bioinfo. icon co logia.net/SNPstats ). Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between SNP and IS using gender, age, high fat diet, low ﬁber diet, smoking and alcohol status, BMI, and WC as covariates in the model. Generalized multi factor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) [ 19 ] was used to analyze the gene–environment interaction, and cross-validation consistency, the testing-balanced accuracy, and the sign test, to assess each selected interaction, were calculated.

# Results  

A total of 1162 subjects (612 men and 550 women), with a mean age of  $63.1\pm12.5$   years old, were selected, including 580 IS patients and 582 normal controls. Participants charact eris tics stratiﬁed by ischemic stroke cases and controls are shown in Table  2 . The mean of age, BMI, and WC was sign i cant ly different between cases and controls.  

There were signiﬁcant differences in rs4646903 alleles and genotypes distributions between cases and controls (Table  3 ). The frequency for rs4646903 minor alleles was lower in cases than that in normal controls, and C allele of rs4646903 was  $20.7~\%$   in ischemic stroke cases and   $27.1\ \%$  in controls subjects   $(p<0.001)$  . Logistic analysis showed the signiﬁcant association between genotypes of variants in rs4646903 and decreased ischemic stroke risk, after adjustment for gender, age, high fat diet, low ﬁber diet, smoking and alcohol status, BMI, and WC. The carriers of homozygous mutant of rs4646903 polymorphism revealed decreased ischemic stroke risk than those with wild-type homozygotes, and OR (  $95~\%$   CI) was 0.71 (0.64–0.92).  

We employed the GMDR analysis to assess the impact of the gene–gene interaction among four SNP, after adjustment for covariates, including gender, age, high fat diet, low ﬁber diet, alcohol status, BMI, and WC. Table  4 summarizes the results obtained from GMDR analysis for two- to four-locus models. There was a signiﬁcant twolocus model  $(p=0.0107)$  ) involving rs4646903 and rs1048943, indicating a potential gene–gene interaction between rs4646903 and rs1048943. Overall, the two-locus models had a cross-validation consistency of 9 of 10, and had the testing accuracy of   $60.72~\%$  .  

To obtain the odds ratios and  $95~\%$   CI for the joint effects of rs4646903 and rs1048943 on ischemic stroke risk, we conducted interaction analysis between the two SNP. We found that subjects with TC or CC of rs4646903 and AG or GG of rs1048943 genotype have the lowest ischemic stroke risk, compared to subjects with TT of rs4646903 and AA of rs1048943 genotype, and OR (  $95~\%$  CI) was 0.63 (0.42–0.89), after adjustment for gender, age, alcohol status, high fat diet, low ﬁber diet, BMI and WC (Table  5 ).

association between genotypes of variants in rs4646903 with decreased IS risk, after covariates adjustment. The carriers of homozygous mutant of rs4646903 polymorphisms revealed decreased IS risk than those with wildtype homozygotes. CYP1A1 is an important member of the CYP family present mainly in extra hepatic tissues and is responsible for the metabolism of a large number of xe no biotic s as well as a small number of endogenous substrates [ 20 ]. Studies on this gene have involved in several diseases, including cancer [ 21 ], coronary artery disease (CAD) [ 22 ], and so on. Recently, several studies have focused on the association between CYP1A1 SNP and stoke risk in different population. However, the results of these studies were inconsistent. Sultana et al. [ 23 ] indicated that the CYP1A1 CC genotype is associated with the decreased risk of ischemic stroke in South Indian Population. A study conducted by Moon et al. [ 24 ] conclude that T6235C CYP1A1 polymorphism is a risk factor for the development of CI and suggest that GST polymorphism contributes to the odds of CI. Demirdo¨gen et al. [ 25 ] suggested that CYP1A1 6235C allele is associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke. This ﬁnding might be at least in part due to the association of this allele with decreased risk of

hypertension and hypertension and smoke-associated ischemic stroke in Turkish population.  

The multiple genotypes, such as IS, were a result of many gene polymorphisms, and gene–gene interactions. The study by Gambier et al. [ 26 ] is the ﬁrst to show an interaction between the CYP1A1 T3801C and AHR G1661A polymorphisms on blood pressure in the Stanislas cohort. This interaction could explain the difference in blood pressure level between smokers and non-smokers/exsmokers. However, it was from then that no study focused on the impact of interaction among several SNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study on interaction among several SNPs in CYP1A1 gene. We found a potential gene–gene interaction between rs4646903 and rs1048943 using GMDR model, subjects with TCor CCof rs4646903 and AG or GG of rs1048943 genotype have the lowest ischemic stroke risk, compared to subjects with TT of rs4646903 and AA of rs1048943 genotype, and OR  $95~\%$   CI) was 0.63 (0.42–0.89). CYPs are phase I metabolizing enzymes in which substrate is oxidized; phase II metabolizing enzymes often use the oxygen as a site for further metabolism into an excretable product. Epidemiological and animal-based studies suggest that a variety of candidate genes, including hemostatic genes, genes controlling homo cyst eine metabolism, and the gene that encodes endo the li al nitric oxide synthase, are important in the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke [ 27 ,  28 ]. Age and sex could inﬂuence the results obtained in this study, we have compared the mean of age and percentage of males in participants with wild type, heterozygote, and mutation homozygote, we found that there is no signiﬁcant difference in three groups, in addition, we also adjusted some covariates, including gender and age, so we think that the results obtained in this study were not sign i cant ly inﬂuence by gender and age factors, although gender and age are important risk factors for IS risk.  

The limitations of this study should be considered. First, more SNP of CYP1A1 gene should been included in the study, and interaction analysis should be conducted for gene–gene interaction with others gene. In addition, interaction with others environmental risk factors should be investigated in the future studies, such as diet behavior or alcohol consumption, and so on. Third, we did not know whether the variants C in rs4646903, and A in rs1048943 were bi-allelic or in cis, so the results may be inﬂuenced by the functional consequences of the combined SNP setting in patients; future studies should verify this results in different populations.  

In conclusion, we found a signiﬁcant association between genotypes of variants in rs4646903 with decreased IS risk, after covariates adjustment. The carriers of homozygous mutant of rs4646903 polymorphisms revealed decreased IS risk than those with wild-type homozygotes. We also found a potential gene–gene interaction between rs4646903 and rs1048943 using GMDR model, and subjects with TC or CC of rs4646903 and AG or GG of rs1048943 genotype have the lowest ischemic stroke risk, compared to subjects with TT of rs4646903 and AA of rs1048943 genotype.
