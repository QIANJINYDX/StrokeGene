# Abstract  

Cerebral preconditioning (PC) confers endogenous brain protection after stroke. Ischemic stroke patients with a prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) may potentially be in a preconditioned state. Although PC has been associated with the activation of prosurvival signals, the mechanism by which preconditioning confers neuro protection is not yet fully clarified. Recently, we have described that PC-mediated neuro protection against ischemic insult is promoted by p53 de stabilization, which is mediated by its main regulator MDM2. Moreover, we have previously described that the human    $T\!p53\,A r g72P r o$   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) controls susceptibility to ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis and governs the functional outcome of patients after stroke. Here, we studied the contribution of the human    $T\!p53\,A r g72P r o$   SNP on PC-induced neuro protection after ischemia. Our results showed that cortical neurons expressing the Pro72-p53 variant exhibited higher PC-mediated neuro protection as compared with Arg72-p53 neurons. PC prevented ischemia-induced nuclear and cytosolic p53 stabilization in Pro72-p53 neurons. However, PC failed to prevent mitochondrial p53 stabilization, which occurs in Arg72-p53 neurons after ischemia. Furthermore, PC promoted neuro protection against ischemia by controlling the p53/active caspase-3 pathway in Pro72-p53, but not in Arg72-p53 neurons. Finally, we found that good prognosis associated to TIA within 1 month prior to ischemic stroke was restricted to patients harboring the Pro72 allele. Our findings demonstrate that the    $T\!p53\,A r g72P r o$   SNP controls PC-promoted neuro protection against a subsequent ischemic insult by modulating mitochondrial p53 stabilization and then modulates TIA-induced ischemic tolerance.

The restriction in blood supply to the brain causes a shortage of oxygen and glucose to maintain cellular metabolism, which elicits a pathological response. Paradoxically, transient brief episodes of controlled ischemia confer protection against a subsequent prolonged ischemia. This phenomenon described as cerebral preconditioning (PC) has been evidenced both in vitro and in vivo models [ 1 – 3 ]. The efficacy of PC in reducing brain injury after an ischemic damage has also been demonstrated in clinical studies. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is considered to be the clinical correlate of PC. Thus, patients with previous ips i lateral TIA before an ischemic stroke had better outcome than patients without previous TIA [ 4 – 6 ]. Therefore, it provides clear evidence that PC may be effective to reduce brain injury in human against ischemic insult [ 7 – 10 ].  

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the study of molecular mechanisms responsible for PCmediated neuro protection, as well as its possible application in therapies for cerebral ischemic damage [ 1 ,  2 ]. It was reported that cerebral PC is implicated in different mechanisms such as the inhibition of glutamate release [ 11 ,  12 ], or the increase in neuronal resistance to the ex ci to toxic insult [ 13 – 15 ]. This neuro protective response initiated through the post-translational modification of proteins is rapid and occurs within minutes to hours [ 16 – 18 ]. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for PC-mediated neuro protection have not been elucidated so far.  

The deletion of the  Tp53  gene is associated with neuroprotection following ischemia [ 19 ]. Moreover, since nuclear p53 transcriptional activity has been associated specifically with apoptosis of cortical neurons [ 20 ], the interference with p53 activity has inspired potential applications in therapy. The protein p53 is trans located from the cytosol to the mitochondria and mediates transcriptional dependent or independent apoptosis cell death [ 21 ,  22 ], in response to stimulus such as ischemia [ 20 ]. In this context, several studies have shown that p53 is trans located from the cytosol to the mitochondria [ 23 ,  24 ] in response to ischemia. Indeed,  $\mathsf{p}53\;\mathrm{me-}$  diates apoptosis through its direct action in the mitochondria, where p53 binds to pro-apoptotic PUMA and Bax, promoting cytochrome c release [ 25 ], in different cell types and tissues, including brain [ 22 ,  26 ]. In contrast, the inhibition of caspase-3-mediated apoptotic pathway activation by PC has also been associated with ischemic tolerance in transient cerebral ischemia in vivo models [ 27 ]. Accordingly, several studies have shown that PC decreases neuronal apoptosis and reduces the subsequent neurological deficits and infarct volume within 24 to  $72\,\mathrm{h}$   after ischemia [ 28 ,  29 ], by promot- ing ischemic tolerance [ 27 ]. In a recent work, we have dem- onstrated that PC confers neuronal ischemic tolerance by increasing MDM2 protein level, which promotes its interaction with p53 and triggers p53 nuclear and cytosolic desta- bilization [ 30 ]. Indeed, our previous results have demonstrated that PC attenuates ischemia-induced activation of the p53/PUMA/caspase-3 signaling pathway and subsequent neuronal death. Hence, the aim of our study was to identify the function of p53 and related proteins on neuroprotection associated to PC prior to a later ischemic insult and its role in neuronal ischemic tolerance.  

Previously, we have identified that the human    $\mathit{T p53}$   $A r g72P r o$   polymorphism explains different functional prognosis in stroke [ 22 ,  31 ]. We found that Arg72-p53, but not Pro72-p53 polymorphic variant, interacts directly with Bcl-xL in the mitochondria, which increases neuronal vulnerability to ischemia-induced apoptotic cell death [ 22 ]. In addition, our group have recently published that the Tp53 Arg72Pro  SNP determines neo vascular iz ation, brain repair, and neurological recovery after intra cerebral hemorrhage [ 31 ]. Here, we study the function of human    $\mathit{T p53}$  Arg72Pro  SNP on PC-induced neuro protection and ischemic tolerance. Our results show that PC prevented ischemia-induced nuclear and cytosolic p53 stabilization in Pro72-p53; however, this effect was not observed in Arg72-p53, cortical neurons. Moreover, PC prevented ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis and caspase-3 activation, leading to ischemic tolerance in Pro72-p53 cortical neurons. Hence, here, we aim to report for the first time that the    $T\!p53\ A r g72P r o$   SNP modulates PC-induced neuro protection against ischemia by controlling the   $\mathsf{p}53/\$  caspase-3 signaling pathway. Moreover, we aim to confirm the relevance of the    $T\!p53\,A r g72P r o\;\mathrm{S}$  SNP in functional outcome of ischemic stroke patients within the first month after a transitory ischemic attack (TIA).  

# Methods  

Primary Cultures of Cortical Neurons  Neuronal cultures were prepared from E14.5 mouse embryo cortices. The humanized knock-in mice for the    $T\!p53\,A r g72P r o$   SNP were kindly donated by Prof D.G. Johnson (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, Texas, USA) [ 32 ]. Animals were maintained in specific-pathogen-free facilities at the University of Salamanca, in accordance with Spanish legislation (RD53/2013) under license from the Spanish government and the EU (2010/63/EU). Protocols were approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of Salamanca. Neurons expressing two different polymorphic variants

 (Pro72-p53 neurons or Arg72-p53 neurons) were seeded at

  $1.8\times10^{5}$    2   cells/cm in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, Madrid, Spain) supplemented with   $2\%$   B27 (Invitrogen) and glutamine   $2~\mathrm{mM}$   (Invitrogen), and incubated at   $37\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   in a humidified   $5\%$     $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  -containing atmosphere. Half of the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium every 3 – 4 days.  

Oxygen Glucose Deprivation and Preconditioning Models After 9 – 10 DIV, neurons were exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) induced by incubating cells at   $37~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $90\;\mathrm{{min}}$   in an incubator equipped with an air lock and continuously gassed with  $95\%~\mathrm{N}_{2}/5\%~\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   (Thermo Scientific Forma Water Jacket  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   incubator); with a  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   infrared sensor and variable oxygen control, connecting with injection of  $\mathbf{N}_{2}$   gas supply to control oxygen at suppressed levels and a fuel cell as oxygen control sensor that puts out a linear millivolt signal based on  $\mathrm{O}_{2}$   content of the chamber and provides fast recovery to desired hypoxic conditions for reliable and accurate control. The incubation medium (buffered Hanks ’ solution without glucose:   $5.26~\mathrm{mM}$   KCl,   $0.43~\mathrm{mM}$   $\mathrm{{NH}_{2}\mathrm{{CO}_{4}}}$  ,  $132.4\ \mathrm{mM\NacCl}$  , 4.09 mM   $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$  ,   $0.33\ \mathrm{mM}$     $\mathrm{Na_{2}H P O_{4}}$  ,  $2\mathrm{\mM\CaCl}_{2}$  , and   $20~\mathrm{mM}$   HEPES,   $\mathrm{pH}\ 7.4$  ) was previously gassed with   $95\%$   $\Nu_{2}/5\%$   CO2 for   $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$  . Under these conditions, oxygen concentrations in the incubation medium were

  $6.7\pm0.5\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$   as measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode

 [ 33 ,  34 ]. In case of preconditioning (PC), the neurons were treated with a moderated subtoxic concentration of N-MethylD -Aspartate (  $20\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$  , NMDA-PC) for 2 h prior to a subsequent lethal ischemia induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD;   $90~\mathrm{min}$  ); (NMDA $\mathrm{PC}+\mathrm{OGD})$   previously validated PC method [ 30 ,  35 ,  36 ]. In parallel, neurons were incubated under Normoxia (Nx) or NMDA-PC conditions at   $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   in a humidified atmosphere of   $95\%$   air/  $'5\%$     $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   in buffered Hanks ’  solution buffer. Under these conditions, oxygen concent rations in the incubation medium were   $190\pm15~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   as measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Unless otherwise stated, neuronal samples were collected at  $4\mathrm{~h~}$   of reoxygenation after OGD and processed accordingly.  

Flow Cytometric Detection of Apoptotic Cell Death  Neurons were carefully detached from the plates using   $1\,\mathrm{mM}$   EDTA (tetra sodium salt) in PBS   $(\mathrm{pH}\ 7.4)$   at room temperature. Cells were stained with annexin V-APC and 7-AAD in binding buffer (  $.100\ \mathrm{mM}$   HEPES,   $140\ \mathrm{mM}$   NaCl,   $2.5\,\mathrm{\mM}$   $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$  ), according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions and performed exactly as we previously described [ 22 ], to determine quantitatively the percentage of apoptotic neurons by flow cytometry. Four replicates per condition   $(3\times10^{5}$  cells each) were analyzed on a FAC S calibur flow cytometer (  $15~\mathrm{mW}$   argon ion laser tuned at   $488~\mathrm{nm}$  ; CellQuest software, BD Bioscience s). The annexin V-APC stained cells that were 7AAD negative were considered to be apoptotic + − (AnnexinV /7AAD ).  

Flow Cytometric Analysis of Membrane Potential   $(\Psi{\sf m})~\Psi{\sf m}$  was assessed using the MitoProbe DilC1(5) Assay Kit for Flow Cytometry (Invitrogen), and stained cells were analyzed on the FL1 and FL4 channels of a FAC S calibur flow cytometer (  $15\,\mathrm{\mW}$   argon ion laser tuned at   $488\,\mathrm{\nm}$  ; CellQuest software; BD Bioscience s) as we previously described [ 22 ].  $\Psi\mathrm{m}$   values were expressed as percentages, and the   $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   of mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(tr if luo rome th oxy) phenyl hydra zone (  $.10~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  ; FCCP) was used for  $15\;\mathrm{{min}}$   to define the   $0\%$     $\Psi\mathrm{m}$   values.  

Quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) Analysis  Total RNA samples were purified from neurons using a commercially available kit (Sigma) and RT-qPCR was performed with Power SYBR Green RNA-toCT TM 1-Step kit (Applied Biosystems, Township, USA). Reverse transcription was performed for  $30\;\mathrm{{min}}$   at  $48\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , and PCR conditions were  $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$   at  $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   followed by 40 cycles of  $15~\mathrm{s}$   at   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   plus 1 min at   $55~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   using the following forward and reserve primers, respectively (Thermo Scientific, Offenbach, Germany),   $5^{\prime}$  -A TTC TG CCC ACCA CACA GC G ACA  $.3^{\prime}$   and   $5^{\prime}$   A GG GC TTC CT CT GG GCC TTC TA-  $.3^{\prime}$   (p53),  $5^{\prime}$  -GG GT GT GA ACCA C GAGA A AT $\cdot3^{\prime}$   and   $5^{\prime}$  -GACT GT G GTC AT GAG CCC TT $.3^{\prime}$   (Gapdh). The mRNA abundance of each transcript was normalized to the Gapdh mRNA abundance obtained in the same sample. The relative mRNA levels were calculated using the    $\Delta\Delta\mathrm{Ct}$   method and were expressed as the fold change between sample and calibrator.  

Caspase-3 Activity Assay  Caspase-3 activity was assessed in cell lysates and according to manufacturers ’  instructions via Flu ori metric Assay kit CASP3F from SIGMA and read at emission wavelength  $405~\mathrm{nm}$  . The method is based on the release of the fluorescent 7-amino-4-methyl co umar in (AMC) moiety. The AMC concentration is calculated using a AMC standard.  

Western Blotting  Neurons were lysed in buffer containing  $1\%$  SDS,  $2~\mathrm{mM}$   EDTA,   $150\;\mathrm{{mM\;N a C l}}$  ,   $12.5\:\mathrm{mM}$     $\mathrm{Na_{2}H P O_{4}}$  , and  $1\%$   Triton X-100 (NP40:   $1\%$   NP40, EDTA   $\mathrm{diag^{+}}\;5\;\mathrm{mM}$  , Tris  $\mathrm{pH}\,8\,20\,\mathrm{mM}$  ,  $\mathrm{NaCl}\,135\,\mathrm{mM}.$  , and   $10\%$   glycerol), supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM   $\mathrm{Na}_{3}\mathrm{VO}_{4}$   and  $50~\mathrm{mM}$  NaF) and protease inhibitors (  $(100~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   phenyl methyl s ulf on yl fluoride,   $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   anti-papain,   $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   pepstatin,   $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$  amastatin,   $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   leupeptin,   $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   bestatin, and  $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   soybean trypsin inhibitor), stored on ice for  $30~\mathrm{min}$  , and boiled for   $5~\mathrm{min}$  . Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA (bic inchon in ic acid) method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (BCA Protein Assay kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Extracts were centrifuged at  $13{,}000\mathrm{g}$   for 5 min at  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Aliquots of lysed, nuclear, cytosol- ic, or mitochondrial extracts   $(20{-}70~\upmu\mathrm{g}$   protein) were subjected to SDS-polya cry l amide gel (Mini PROTEAN; Bio-Rad Laboratories) and blotted with anti-p53 (1:100) (554157, BD Bioscience s), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175, 9661, Cell Signaling), anti-MDM2 (2A10, ab16895), anti-PUMA (ab54288) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-lamin B (sc374015, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) anti-GAPDH (Ambion, Cambridge, UK) overnight at   $4~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Signal detection was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the auto radiograms were scanned. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software [ 37 ].  

Subcellular Fractionation  Cells were washed with cold PBS containing 1 mM   $\mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$  , harvested with cytosolic buffer (  $10\ \mathrm{mM}$   HEPES,   $1.5\,\mathrm{\mum}$     $\mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$  ,   $10\,\mathrm{\mM}$   KCl,   $1\,\mathrm{\mum}$  EDTA,   $0.1\%~\mathrm{NP}{.}40,\,\nu/\nu,\,1.5~\mathrm{M}$   sucrose, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors mixture,  $\mathrm{pH}\ 7.9.$  ), triturated with a micropipette to promote cell lysis, left on ice for   $30~\mathrm{min}$  , and vortexed for   $10~\mathrm{s}$  . After checking cell lysis under a light microscope, extracts were centrifuged at  $830\times g$   for   $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$  . Lysis of the nuclei was performed by re suspending the nuclear pellet in nuclear buffer   $50~\mathrm{mM}$   HEPES,   $1.5\ \mathrm{{mM\MgCl}_{2}}$  ,   $10~\mathrm{mM}$  KCl mM,   $0.5\ \mathrm{mM\N a C l}$  ,   $1\ \mathrm{mM}$   EDTA,   $1\%\;\mathrm{NP}.40,\,\nu/\nu,$   and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture,  $\mathrm{pH}\,7.9\$  ), triturated with a micro pipette, left on ice for  $2\,\mathrm{h}$  , vortexed (10 s), boiled  $5\,\mathrm{min})$  , and sonicated   $5\,\mathrm{min}$  ). The super nat ant (mito ch on dr i- al and cytosolic fractions) was then centrifuged at   $17{,}000{\times}g$  for   $12\,\mathrm{min}\,(4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  , and the cytosolic fraction (super nat ant) was lysed in  $2\times$   RIPA buffer (  $2\%$   sodium dodecyl sulfate,  $2~\mathrm{mM}$  EDTA,  $2\,\mathrm{mM}$   EGTA, and  $50\,\mathrm{mM}$   Tris,  $\mathrm{pH}\,7.5\$  ), supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM  $\mathrm{Na}_{3}\mathrm{VO}_{4}$   and 50 mM NaF) and protease inhibitors (  $100~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   phenyl methyl s ulf on yl fluoride (PMSF),   $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   anti-papain,   $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   pepstatin,  $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   amastatin,   $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   leupeptin,   $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   bestatin, and   $50\;\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   soybean trypsin inhibitor), and boiled for  $5\,\mathrm{min}$  [ 37 ]. The mitochondrial fraction (pellet) was re suspended in isolation medium (  $320\,\mathrm{mM}$   sucrose,   $1\,\mathrm{mM}$   potassium EDTA, and   $10~\mathrm{mM}$   Tris-HCl,   $\mathrm{pH}\ 7.4$  ) and was homogenized in a tight-fitting glass — Teflon homogenize r (20 strokes) [ 22 , 38 ]. Mitochondrial fraction was lysed with   $2\times$   RIPA buffer for protein analysis by immuno blotting.  

Immuno cyto chemistry  Neurons grown on glass coverslips were fixed with   $4\%$     $(\nu/\nu,$   in PBS) para formaldehyde for  $30\ \mathrm{min}$   and immuno stained with rabbit anti-cleaved caspase3 (Asp175) (1:300; Cell Signaling Techn, Inc.), mouse antiMAP2 (1:500; SIGMA) [ 39 ], mouse anti-p53 (1:200; 554157, BD Bioscience s) [ 30 ], and rabbit-COX IV (1:1000; ab16056, Abcam) antibodies. Immuno labeling was detected using anti-rabbit IgG – Cy3 (1:500) or anti-mouse IgG – Cy2 (1:500; Jackson Immuno Research). Coverslips were washed, mounted in SlowFade light anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen) on glass slides, and examined using a microscope (Nikon Inverted microscope Eclipse Ti-E) equipped with  $\times\,20$   objective and a pre-centered fiber illuminator Nikon In tens i light C-HGFI and black and white charge-coupled device digital camera Hamamatsu ORCAER, or on a scanning laser confocal microscope ( B Spinning disk ^  Roper Scientific Olympus IX81) with three lasers (405, 491, and   $561~\mathrm{nm})$  ) and equipped with  $\times\,40$  and  $\times\,63$   PL Apo oil-immersion objective for high resolution imaging and device digital camera Evolve Photometric s.  

Patient Cohorts  Nested case control study was designed on previously collected cohorts of patients with ischemic stroke defined as infarction of the central nervous system tissue [ 40 ], between 2012 and 2015 in three University Hospitals (Salamanca, Valladolid, and Lleida, Spain). Among this cohort, we selected patients with prior TIA defined as a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than  $^{1\textrm{h}}$  , and without evidence of acute infarction [ 40 ] and a randomized subset of patients without it. Inclusion criteria were acute ischemic stroke patients, previously independent for daily life activities, with a TIA within 1 month before the stroke, and patients without it. Patients were admitted within the first   $24\,\mathrm{h}$   after the onset of symptoms, or from the start of sleep in those with symptoms upon awakening. Exclusion criteria were intra cerebral hemorrhage, TIA history more than 1 month before the stroke, insufficient clinical data, and lack of informed consent. Eighty-five patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria for the study. Clinical and epidemiological data were taken from patients ’  charts. The study was approved by the local ethics committees. All the patients or their relatives provided their informed consent before taking part of the study.  

Clinical Variables  Patients were admitted to the Neurology departments and treated according to the Guidelines of the cerebro vascular disease study Group of the Spanish Society of Neurology [ 41 ]. Baseline demographic and clinical data included age, sex, pre-onset modified Rankin Scale (mRS), past medical history, vascular risk factors, and previous treatment. Standard 12-lead ECG and cranial Computed Tomography (CT) or brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) were performed at admission. Details of previous TIAwere obtained from the patient and medical records. Standard definitions of TIA and stroke were used. Stroke subtypes were classified according to the TOAST criteria [ 42 ]. Stroke severity was assessed using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission. Functional outcome was evaluated at 3 months after stroke using the mRS. NIHSS and mRS were evaluated by internationally certified neurologists. The main outcome measure for all patients was functional status at 3 months; mRS score  $\leq2$   was considered good outcome [ 43 ].  

Human  Tp53  Polymorphism Analysis  Genotyping of human Tp53  polymorphism was performed at the University of Salamanca by authors blinded to the clinical status of patients, by using the PCR-RFLP technique [ 22 ]. The  Tp53  SNP of exon 4 at codon 72 (  ${}A r g72P r o$  ; rs1042522) was detected by amplifying genomic DNA with the forward primer   $5^{\prime}$  -TCTA CA GTC CCCC TT GCC GT $\cdot3^{\prime}$   and the reverse primer   $5^{\prime}$  - CT GAC CGT GC A AGT CACA GA-  $\cdot3^{\prime}$  .  Tp53  exon 4, where BstU1 (Bsh1236I) RFLP is located, was amplified within a 298-bp DNA fragment. Digests were separated on agarose gel

  $(3\%)$   and the Midori Green Advance-stained DNA fragments

 (Nippon Genetics Europe GmbH, Düren, Germany) were analyzed under a UV source using the Bio-Rad Universal Hood II Gel Imager system (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The distribution of genotype frequencies in  $A r g72P r o$   between the stroke patients was within the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium   $\mathit{\left(p>0.1\right.}$   in all cases). As the  Pro  allele is likely to exert a dominant effect on the    $A r g$   one [ 22 ], two groups were considered for this study: Pro   $(P r o/P r o$   and  Pro / Arg  genotypes) and Arg   $(A r g/$  Arg  genotype) patients.  

Statistical Analysis  The results obtained in cell cultures are expressed as means  $\pm$   SEM values from four different culture preparations. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by the least significant difference multiple range test. In these cases,  $p\!<\!0.05$   value was considered significant. Clinical results are expressed as percentages for categorical variables. For the continuous variables, the results are expressed as either the mean  $\pm\mathrm{~S.D}$  . or median (25th and 75th percentiles) depending on whether or not the data followed a normal distribution, respectively. The Kolmogorov – Smirnov test was used for testing the normality of the distribution. The Student  $t$   test (normal data) or the Mann – Whitney test (non-normal data) was used to compare continuous variables between two groups. Proportions were compared using the  $x^{2}$    and fisher test. In all instance,  $p<0.05$  values were considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 22.0 for Macintosh (IBM, Madrid, Spain).

# NMDA-PC Prevents Ischemia-Induced p53 Stabilization in Pro72-p53 Neurons, but Not in Arg72-p53 Neurons  

We have previously identified that the Arg72-p53, but not Pro72-p53, interacts directly with anti-apoptotic mito ch on dr ial Bcl-xL, then increasing vulnerability to ischemia-induced apoptotic death in cortical neurons [ 22 ]. To study the role of human  Tp53 Arg72Pro  SNP on the PC-mediated neuro pro tection, we obtained cortical neurons from humanized  Tp53 knock-in mice for the  Arg72Pro  SNP. First, neurons expressing human Pro72-p53 or Arg72-p53 variants were exposed to a validated in vitro model of PC induced by NMDA (NMDAPC) [ 30 ,  36 ] and/or oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) protocol [ 33 ]. As shown in Fig.  1 a, b, 4 h of re oxygenation following OGD induced p53 stabilization and the expression of its transcriptional target PUMA in both Pro72-p53 and Arg72- p53 neurons, when compared with normoxic (Nx) conditions. These results demonstrate that neurons expressing either Pro72-p53 or Arg72-p53 are equally sensitive to ischemiamediated p53 stabilization. However, NMDA-PC prior to the insult (OGD) prevented p53 stabilization in Pro72-p53 neurons, but not in neurons expressing the Arg72-p53 SNP variant (Fig.  1 a, b). Since NMDA-PC increased MDM2 levels in neurons (Fig.  1 a) and this effect was maintained after OGD in both genotypes, we therefore confirmed that only preconditioned  $\mathrm{{Pr}o}^{72}$  -p53 neurons might display p53 destabilization after ischemia through a MDM2-dependent mechanism. According to our previous results [ 30 ], we also verified that p53 mRNA remained unaltered during preconditioning (Fig.  1 c), which highlights the importance of posttranslational regulation of p53 after ischemic events. These results demonstrate that human    $T\!p\,53\ A r g72P r o$   polymorphism conditions NMDA-PC-mediated p53 de stabilization after OGD, which might control neuronal susceptibility to the ischemic insult.  

To trans activate p53 target genes such as p21, PUMA, and p53 itself, the stabilization and subsequent nuclear translocation of p53 is required [ 44 ,  45 ]. Thus, we investigated whether NMDA-PC prevents ischemia-induced p53 nuclear transloca- tion. Nuclear, cytosolic and mitochondrial neuronal fractions were obtained separately, and protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.  2 a, p53 is trans located to the nucleus in both Pro72-p53 and Arg72-p53 neurons after re oxygenation following ischemia. However, the nuclear (Fig. 2 a) and cytosolic (Fig.  2 b) de stabilization of p53 induced by NMDA-PC was evidenced only in Pro72-p53 neurons at  $4\mathrm{~h~}$  after OGD. In the case of Arg72-p53 neurons, NMDA-PC failed to prevent ischemia-induced mitochondrial p53 accumulation, as shown after Western blot analysis (Fig.  2 c) and co-immuno staining with anti-p53 and mitochondrial marker (Fig.  2 d), respectively. Moreover, preconditioned neurons expressing   $\mathrm{Pro}72\mathrm{-}\mathrm{p}53$   showed intact mitochondrial membrane potential   $(\Delta\psi_{\mathrm{m}})$   in contrast to those expressing Arg72-p53, which collapsed their    $\Delta\uppsi_{\mathrm{m}}$   (Fig.  2 e). Hence, Arg72-p53 cortical neurons are more susceptible to p53-associated mitochondria dysfunction than Pro72-p53 neurons, as we previously described [ 22 ]. Moreover, NMDA-PC failed to prevent p53 stabilization after ischemia in neurons expressing the Arg72-p53 variant.  

# NMDA-PC Prevents Ischemia-Induced Apoptosis and Caspase-3 Activation in Pro72-p53 Neurons, but Not in Arg72-p53 Neurons  

The transcriptional enhancement of pro-apoptotic genes mediated by p53, such as PUMA [ 44 ,  45 ], contributes to activation of caspases and subsequent neuronal death [ 46 ]. Having demonstrated that the    $T\!p53\,A r g72P r o$   polymorphism controls p53 stabilization after PC, we next studied its relevance in NMDA-PC-induced neuro protection. Then, we measured apoptotic cell death (Fig.  3 a, b) and caspase-3 activation (Fig. 3 c) in neurons expressing either Pro72-p53 or Arg72-p53 polymorphic variants. According to our previous results [ 22 ], flow cytometry analysis revealed that re oxygenation following OGD promoted apoptosis in a time-dependent manner (Fig.  3 a). We also observed that NMDA-PC prevented the ischemia-induced apoptosis in Pro72-p53, after  $4\mathrm{~h~}$   of reoxygenation (Fig.  3 b), which confirmed the neuro protective effect of controlled NMDA-PC in cortical neurons subjected to ischemia. However, NMDA-PC-induced neuro protection was not observed in Arg72-p53 neurons. Additionally, OGD induced caspase-3 activation in both genotypes as revealed by flu or ime try assay, which was exclusively prevented by NMDA-PC in Pro72-p53 neurons (Fig.  3 c). Furthermore, co-immuno staining with anti-MAP2 (neuronal marker) and anti-active caspase-3 antibodies confirmed the activation of

Furthermore, as shown in ( a ) similar expression levels of its E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2 caspase-3 in neurons after OGD, as well as the lower activation of caspase-3 in preconditioned Pro72-p53 neurons, when compared to Arg72-p53 ones after the ischemic insult (Fig. 3 d, e). These results validated the PC method utilized and demonstrated the effectiveness of NMDA-PC-promoted control of p53/Caspase-3 pathway in Pro72-p53 neurons, but not in Arg72-p53 neurons.  

# TIA Prevents Poor Prognosis After Stroke in Patients with the  Pro72 allele , but Not in Those with the  Arg / Arg  Genotype  

Finally, to study the possible clinical relevance of our results, we assessed whether the    $T\!p53\,A r g72P r o$   SNP was associated with TIA-induced good prognosis after ischemic stroke. We used a cohort of patients with or without TIA within 1 month prior stroke and were matched by functional outcome based on the mRS score [ 43 ] (see Table  1  for baseline character istics). First, we confirm in our cohort that patients suffering a TIA before stroke presented better prognosis at 3 months than patients without previous TIA (Fig.  4 a). Next, we study the effects of a TIAwithin a month prior stroke according to  Tp53  $A r g72P r o$   patients ’  genotype. We found that significant TIAinduced reduction in median mRS scores at 3 months after stroke was observed in patients harboring the dominant  $P r o$  allele (referred as Pro patients, Fig.  4 b), when compared with those not suffering a previous TIA (No TIA) (Fig.  4 b). However, this effect was not so evident in patients homozygous  $A r g/A r g$   (referred as Arg patients, Fig.  4 c). Moreover, even though TIA also influence the functional outcome of preconditioned Arg patients,   $33\%$   of Arg patients exhibited poor prognosis   $(\mathrm{mRS}>2)$  ) after stroke; whereas, the entire group of Pro patients with previous TIA had a favorable outcome   $(\mathrm{mRS}\leq2)$  ) at 3 months after ischemia stroke (Table  2 ), suggesting that the  $A r g72P r o$   SNP modulates the effectiveness of the protective effect exerted by TIA against a subsequent ischemic insult.  

# Discussion  

Several studies have revealed that polymorphic variants in genes encoding apoptotic proteins could be highly valuable in the diagnosis of stroke [ 47 ] and that p53 stabilization

Fig. 3  NMDA-PC prevents ischemia-induced apoptosis and promoted caspase-3 activation in Pro72-p53 neurons. Cortical neurons from mice expressing human Pro72-p53 or Arg72-p53 polymorphic variants (9 – 10 DIV) were exposed to a validated in vitro model of PC.

Accordingly, NMDA-PC also prevented the activation of caspase-3 induced by OGD, as revealed by both flu or ime try assay ( c ) and immuno staining ( d  and  e ) at   $4\mathrm{~h~}$   after OGD. These results validates

The similar stabilization of p53 reported in Pro72-p53 and Arg72-p53 neurons after OGD, along with unaltered levels of   $\mathsf{p}53\,\mathrm{\mRNA}$   in ischemic neurons confirms the implication of post-translational mechanism in the ischemia-induced stabilization of p53. In this regard, MDM2 is an essential negative regulator of p53 [ 49 ]. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the rapid and continuous degradation of p53 and modulates p53 localization, stability, and transcriptional activity [ 49 ]. We recently found that MDM2-p53 pathway is involved in PC-promoted neuronal ischemic tolerance in both in vitro and in vivo models [ 30 ]. More specifically, we have demonstrated that NMDA-PC increases neuronal MDM2 protein levels, thus preventing ischemia-induced p53 stabilization and promoting neuro protection [ 30 ]. Here, we found that neurons subjected to ischemia prior NMDA-PC express high levels of MDM2 in both  $A r g72P r o$   genotypes. However, the combination of NMDA-PC  $^+$  OGD prevented the aforementioned stabilization of p53 only in Pro72-p53 neurons indicating that only preconditioned Pro72-p53 neurons might display p53 de stabilization and increased protection against ischemia through a MDM2-dependent mechanism. In fact, nuclear accumulation of Pro72-p53 variant might be decisive to MDM2-mediated translocation of p53 from nucleus to cytosol and subsequent degradation by proteasome, which might be responsible for differences between genotypes.  

In response to ischemia, a fraction of stabilized p53 translocates to mitochondria leading a rapid pro-apoptotic response in a transcriptional-independent manner [ 50 ,  51 ]. In particular, the mitochondrial accumulation observed in Arg72-p53, but not Pro72-p53 variant, promotes cytochrome c release and caspase 9 activation after ischemia in neurons [ 22 ]. Here, we observed that p53 stabilization in mitochondria is not prevented by NMDA-PC in Arg72-p53 neurons, which makes them more vulnerable to ischemia-induced mitochondrial membrane disruption and subsequent apoptotic death with respect to Pro72-p53 ones. This might explain the beneficial neuro protective effects of NMDA-PC exclusively observed in Pro72-p53 neurons.  

The p53 protein controls the cell survival/death decision by inducing apoptosis-related genes, such as PUMA, or promoting caspase activation [ 21 ]. Several studies have demonstrated that the absence of p53 and caspase-3 protects neurons against ischemic insult [ 52 ]. Here, we show that NMDA-PC prevents ischemia-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in Pro72-p53 neurons, but fails to protect Arg72-p53 cortical neurons against ischemia. Our data are therefore consistent with the idea that the human    $T p53\,A r g72P r o$   SNP modulates NMDA-PC-promoted neuro protection against ischemia by controlling the p53 mitochondrial translocation and later p53/caspase-3 pathway.  

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) before ischemic stroke could represent a clinical equivalent of cerebral PC [ 4 ,  5 ]. TIAs are temporary episodes associated with relative benign short-term consequences, but they can be a warning signal of an impending stroke. Hence, the relevance of finding an appropriate marker to predict the functional prognosis of patients suffering from TIA might help to act accordingly in case of later stroke. In good agreement with several clinical results [ 9 ,  10 ], we confirmed the neuroprotective role of TIA within first month before an ischemic stroke. Although shorter times between TIA and subsequent stroke could provide better protection, our results showed that 1-month-time interval is also capable to promote this beneficial effect in patients. However, we demonstrated that TIA is not sufficient to ensure better prognosis of patients, but human    $T\!p53\,A r g72P r o$   SNP can modulate their evolution. Even though TIA influenced the functional outcome of preconditioned patients,  $A r g/A r g$   geno- type associated with poor prognosis after ischemia

Fig. 4  TIA associates with a better prognosis in stroke patients with Pro72-p53 genotype.

The study included ( a ) 25 TIA patients, ( b )  Arg / Pro  and  Pro / Pro : 13, referred as Pro and ( c )  Arg / Arg : 12, referred as Arg patients, with TIA within 1 month before stroke and 27 (Pro) and   $13{\mathrm{~Arg}})$  without TIA, respectively.

compared to Pro allele-carrying subjects. The Pro72-p53 variant has been already described as a genetic marker predicting functional outcome after ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke [ 22 ]. Here, the benefit associated with Pro patients suffering TIA within first month prior stroke was shown. Taken together, our results indicate that TIA displays a more efficient protective mechanism against poor functional outcome in Pro patients suffering stroke than in Arg patients.  

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that    $\mathit{T p53}$   $A r g72P r o$   polymorphism modulates NMDA-PC-induced neuro protection against a subsequent ischemic insult, through a mechanism that involves p53 stabilization and modulation of ischemia-induced apoptosis. The clinical relevance of the human    $T p53\ A r g72P r o$   polymorphism in TIA-promoted neuro protection and its role in ischemic tolerance are also stablished in patients. Accordingly, the human  $T p53\,A r g72P r o$   polymorphism might be considered as a non invasive molecular biomarker to predict the
