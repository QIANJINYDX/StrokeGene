# Abstract  

Background and purpose   Studies on the relationship between Ph os ph odi est erase 4 D (PDE4D) gene polymorphism with the  risk of ischemic stroke (IS) have shown discordant results. The present meta-analysis was aimed to clarify the relationship  

between PDE4D gene polymorphism with the risk of IS by estimating pooled analysis of published epidemiological studies. Methods   A comprehensive literature search for all the published articles was performed in various electronic databases,  including PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, Trip Database, Worldwide Science, CINAHL, and Google Scholar up to   $22^{\mathrm{nd}}$   December 2021. Pooled Odds ratios (ORs) with  $95\%$   Confidence Intervals (CIs) under dominant, recessive, and allelic  models were calculated. Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity (Caucasian vs. Asian) was performed to examine the reliability  of these findings. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to detect the heterogeneity between studies. Finally, Begg’s funnel  plot was used to assess the potential for publication bias.  

Results   In our meta-analysis, we identified a total of 47 case–control studies with 20,644 ischemic stroke (IS) cases and  23,201 control subjects, including 17 studies of Caucasian descent and 30 studies of Asian descent. Our findings suggest  that there was a significant relationship between SNP45 gene polymorphism and risk of IS (Recessive model:   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,2.06$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.31–3.23), SNP83 overall (allelic model:  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.22$  ,  $95\%$   CI 1.04–1.42), Asian (allelic model:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.20$  ,   $95\%$    CI 1.05–1.37), and SNP89 Asian (Dominant model:   $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.43$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.29–1.59, recessive model:   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.42$  ,   $95\%$   CI  1.28–1.58) respectively. However, no significant relationship was found between SNP32, SNP41, SNP26, SNP56, and SNP87  gene polymorphisms and risk of IS.  

Conclusion   Findings of this meta-analysis conclude that SNP45, SNP83, and SNP89 polymorphism could be capable of  increasing stroke susceptibility in Asians but not in the Caucasian population. Genotyping of SNP 45, 83, 89 polymorphisms  may be used as a predictor for the occurrence of IS.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a heterogeneous complex disorder and the second  most common cause of death and long-term disability with  higher incidence among adults and older people worldwide  and is a significant public health problem [ 1 ]. Stroke can be  divided into two subtypes:   $20\%$   of cases are hemorrhagic 

 (intra cerebral hemorrhage), and   $80\%$   are ischemic stroke 

 (IS) [ 2 ,  3 ]. Characterization of a sudden decrease in blood  flow to one or more areas within the central nervous system  is considered ‘Ischemic stroke’. In contrast, hemorrhagic  stroke occurs when a weakened blood vessel rupture.  

Both genetic and lifestyle-related factors may increase  the risk of stroke. Genetic factors involving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can indicate susceptibility to  specific stroke subtypes. Numerous mutations in microsatellite markers and SNPs of the STRK1 locus, chromosome  5q12, encoding ph os ph odi est erase (PDE) type 4D (PDE4D),  were identified as independent risk factors for IS [ 3 ]. PDEs  are intracellular enzymes that degrade the cyclic nucleotides adenosine (cAMP) and/or guanosine monophosphate  (cGMP), thereby modulating cellular signaling via the  cAMP/cGMP pathways [ 4 ]. In IS, suppression of PDE4D  protects the blood–brain barrier and reduces both inflammation and thrombosis. Inflammation plays a significant role  in the development of atherosclerosis, and PDE4 has been  significantly expressed in inflammatory cells during cerebral  ischemia [ 5 ]. Variants and polymorphisms in the PDE4D  gene have been investigated in different IS population to  ascertain any associated risks [ 6 ]. In the present study, we  retrospectively reviewed studies focusing on the relationship  of PDE4D gene polymorphism with increasing or decreasing  risk of IS in patients published to date.  

relationship of PDE4D gene polymorphism with the risk of  IS; (2) clinically confirmed diagnosis of IS using CT or MRI  scan; (3) patients aged  $<18$   years for pediatric and  $>18$   years  for adult population; (4) numbers available for patient and  control groups for PDE4D SNP 45, 32, 41, 26, 56, 83, 87, 89  genotype or data provided from which the numbers could be  calculated. No restriction of language was applied.  

# Data extraction  

Two investigators (PK and PS) independently extracted the  data. Following data were extracted from each study: first  author’s name, published year, ethnicity, country, number of  cases and controls, matching criteria, sample source, duration of inclusion, mean age, genotyping method and fre- quency distribution of PDE4D SNP 45, 32, 41, 26, 56, 83,  87, 89 genotypes. Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was  calculated for allelic frequency distribution. Ethnicities were  categorized as either Asian or Caucasian, and the population  was classified into adult and paediatric groups.  

# Methods  

# Quality assessment  

# Literature search  

The current systematic review was reported according to  the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines, and a metaanalysis was conducted with the extracted data [ 7 ]. Relevant  publications (until 31st October 2021) were identified by  searching various electronic databases, including PubMed,  EMbase, Cochrane Library, Trip Database, Worldwide Science, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. The following key  terms were used: ‘Ph os ph odi est erase   $4~\mathrm{{D}^{\prime}}$   OR ‘PDE4D’  AND ‘polymorphism’ OR ‘variant’ OR ‘mutation’ OR  ‘genotype’ AND ‘stroke’ OR ‘ischemic stroke’ OR ‘Cerebral Infarction’ OR ‘Brain Infarction’ OR ‘Cerebro vascular  disease’ OR ‘Cerebro vascular disorder’ in combination with 

 ‘SNP   $45^{\circ}$   OR ‘SNP 56’ OR ‘SNP 87’ OR ‘SNP 89’ OR 

 ‘SNP 32’ OR ‘SNP 41’ OR ‘SNP   $^{83}$   OR SNP   $"26"$   OR 

 ‘rs966221’ OR ‘rs40512’ OR ‘rs12188959’ OR ‘rs702553’  OR ‘rs2910829’ OR ‘rs1396476’. Additionally, the reference  list of the retrieved studies, review articles, and previous  meta-analyses, were manually searched for collecting more  relevant studies often missed while performing the electronic  search. Two authors (MN and PS) independently conducted  the search for various studies, and any discrepancy regarding  the inclusion or exclusion of individual studies was resolved  by consulting the corresponding author (PK).  

# Eligibility criteria  

Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) case–control studies investigating the  Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) [ 8 ] was used for assessing  the quality of the included studies based on three components: selection, comparability and ascertainment of the  outcome. Scores ranged from 01 to 09. Two authors (PS  and MN) independently assessed the quality of the included  studies. Discrepancies over quality scores were resolved by  discussion among all the authors and subsequent consensus  was reached.  

# Statistical analysis  

Odds ratios (ORs) with  $95\%$   Confidence Intervals (CIs) were  calculated to investigate the relationship between PDE4D  (SNP 45, 32, 41, 26, 56, 83, 87, 89) gene polymorphism and  risk of IS using fixed (Mantel–Haenszel method) or random  effects (Der simoni an and Laird method) models [ 9 ,  10 ]. Heterogeneity between studies was compared using Cochran’s  Q statistic and   $\mathrm{I}^{2}$   metric [ 11 ,  12 ].   $\mathrm{I}^{2}$   metric was used to  describe the degree of heterogeneity between included studies, where   $0–25\%$   indicated no observed heterogeneity and  larger values showed increasing heterogeneity, with   $25–50\%$    regarded as low,  $50–75\%$   as moderate and   $75{-}100\%$   as high.  If  $\mathrm{I}^{2}\!<\!50\%$  , a fixed-effects model was used, and if  $\mathrm{I}^{2}\!>\!50\%$  ,  a random-effects model was used. In addition, heterogeneity  between studies was adjusted by subgroup analysis, HWE  status, and meta-regression by quality score of the included  studies. Meta-regression was conducted using the Restriction maximum likelihood (REML) estimate with Knapp- Hartung modification for determining the between-study  variance [ 13 ].  

One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess  the stability of the results. A single study in the meta-analysis was deleted each time to reflect the influence of the individual dataset on the pooled OR. Funnel plots and Egger’s  linear regression test were used to diagnose the potential  publication bias [ 14 ,  15 ]. Presence of selection bias in control participants was evaluated by calculating HWE, and  genotypic frequencies of the control subjects were compared  using the chi-square test. Stratified analyses based on ethnicity (Asian vs. Caucasian) were performed. The reliability  and accuracy of the results were validated by two investigators (PK and PS), who independently analyzed the data  using the software. All statistical analyses were performed  using STATA 13.0 and Review Manager 5.3 software. The  p values were two-sided, and a p value  $<\!0.05$   was statistically significant.  

# Results  

# Literature search  

The initial search yielded 72 records from PubMed, EMbase,  Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central  Register of Controlled Trials), and Google scholar databases. Of them, 22 were excluded after the review of title/ abstract, leaving 50 potential studies for full-text information review. Finally, 47 studies met the inclusion criteria and  were included in this study (Fig.  1 ).  

# Characteristics of eligible studies  

The main characteristics of included studies are presented  in Table  1 . The publication years of the studies included in  our analysis ranged from 2003 to 2019. The sample size in  each study ranged from 91 to 2890 in IS cases and 44 to  4412 in controls subjects for all the included studies in our  meta-analysis. Forty-seven case–control studies (18 studies  for SNP45, 12 for SNP56, 29 for SNP83, six for SNP89, five  for SNP26, seven for SNP41, four studies for SNP32, and  27 studies for SNP87) were included in our meta-analysis.  Studies were carried out in two major ethnic populations;  30 studies were in the Asian while 17 studies were in the  Caucasian population. All studies in this meta-analysis  had controls in HWE. The quality scores of all included  studies were moderately high. Out of 47 studies, 27 studies  had hospital-based and 20 studies had a population-based  source of controls.

# Relationship between PDE4D SNP 45 gene  polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk  

No significant relationship was observed between PDE4D  SNP45 gene polymorphism and risk of IS, under overall 18  studies, dominant model (  $(\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.00$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.95–1.04),  recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.11\$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.83–1.47), and allelic  model   $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.02$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.90–1.16). Upon conduct- ing subgroup analysis on the basis of ethnicity of study  population, significant association was observed in Asian  population in case of recessive model (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!2.06$  ,   $95\%$   CI 

 1.31–3.23); but not in dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.98$  ,   $95\%$   CI 

 0.87–1.09) and allelic model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.32$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.81–2.17)  respectively [Figs.  2 A,  3 A,  4 A)] [Table  2 ]. In Caucasian  population, no significant association was observed under  dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.00$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,0.95–1.05)$  ), recessive  model (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.98$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.75–1.29) and allelic model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.97$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.88–1.07) respectively [Figs.  2 A,  3 A,  4 A] [Table  2 ].  

# Relationship between PDE4D SNP 56 gene  polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk  

Our results revealed that there were no significant relationship between PDE4D SNP56 gene polymorphism and risk of  IS, under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.01$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.96–1.07),  recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.04$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.91–1.18), and allelic  model   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.04$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.90–1.20). Upon subgroup  analysis of the data on ethnicity of the study population, no  significant association was observed in the Asian population under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.06$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.94–1.20),  recessive model (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.17$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.87–1.57) and allelic  model (OR-1.16,  $95\%$   CI 0.87–1.55) respectively [Figs.  2 B,  3 B,  4 B)] [Table  2 ]. Additionally, we did not find any correlation of SNP56 polymorphism with an increased or  decreased risk of IS in all the three genetic models in Caucasian population, as can be observed under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.99$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.93–1.07), recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.00$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.90–1.11) and allelic model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,0.97$  ,   $95\%$   CI  0.84–1.12) respectively [Figs.  2 B,  3 B,  4 B)] [Table  2 ].  

# Relationship between PDE4D SNP 83 gene  polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk  

For SNP83, upon analysing 29 studies, results showed no  significant relationship between PDE4D SNP83 gene polymorphism and risk of IS, under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.98$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.94–1.03), and recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,\!=\!1.11\$  ,   $95\%$    CI 0.97–1.27); but a significant association was observed  under allelic model   $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.22$  ,  $95\%$   CI 1.04–1.42). Upon  performing subtype analysis on the basis of ethnicity of the  study population, no significant association was observed  in the Asian population in dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.97$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.91–1.03), and recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.19$  ,   $95\%$   

  $\mathrm{CI}\,0.97–1.45)$  ; but a significant association in allelic model 

 (OR-1.20,   $95\%$   CI 1.05–1.37) was observed [Figs.  2 D,  3 D,  4 D] [Table  2 ]. In the Caucasian population, no significant  association was observed under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.01\$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.94–1.08), recessive model (  $\mathrm{{OR}}\!=\!0.98$  ,   $95\%$   CI   $0.89{-}1.09)$   and allelic model (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.26$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.80–1.98)  respectively [Figs.  2 D,  3 D,  4 D] [Table  2 ].  

# Relationship between PDE4D SNP 26 gene  polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk  

For SNP26, we failed to find a significant genetic association  between PDE4D SNP26 gene and risk of IS, under overall  dominant model (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.99$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.91–1.08), recessive  model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,0.99$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.89–1.11), and allelic model  (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.98$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.89–1.08) [Figs.  2 F,  3 F,  4 F] [Table  2 ].  

# Relationship between PDE4D SNP 89 gene  polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk  

We did not find any association of the SNP89 gene polymorphism with increased or decreased risk of stroke under  dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.06$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.88–1.28), reces- sive model   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.02$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.85–1.24), and allelic  model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.99$  ,   $95\%$   CI 085–1.15) respectively. After  the data were stratified according to ethnicity of the study  population, our results showed significant association in the  Asian population under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,\!=\!1.43$  ,   $95\%$    CI 1.29–1.59), and recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.42$  ,   $95\%$   CI  1.28–1.58); but no significant association was observed in  allelic model (OR–0.93,   $95\%$   CI 0.74–1.16) [Figs.  2 E,  3 E,  4 E] [Table  2 ]. In the Caucasian population, no significant  association was observed under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.97$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.90–1.05), recessive model (  $\mathrm{{OR}}\!=\!0.97$  ,   $95\%$   CI  0.88–1.05) and allelic model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.00$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.83–1.21)  respectively [Figs.  2 E,  3 E,  4 E] [Table  2 ].  

# Relationship between PDE4D SNP 32 gene  polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk  

No significant relationship was observed between PDE4D  SNP32 gene polymorphism and risk of IS, under overall  dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,\mathrm{=}\,0.89$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.71–1.12), reces- sive model   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.08$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.82–1.44), and allelic  model   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.25$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.96–1.61). Upon conduct- ing subgroup analysis on the basis of ethnicity of study  population, no significant association was observed in  Asian population under dominant model (  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.87$  ,  Fig. 2    A – H : Forest plot for the  relationship between PDE4D  SNP45, SNP56, SNP87,  SNP83, SNP89, SNP26,  SNP41, and SNP32 Polymor- phism with the Risk of Ischemic  Stroke using the Dominant  Model

# Relationship between PDE4D SNP 41 gene  polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk  

The pooled effect among all studies estimates that there were  no significant association between PDE4D SNP41 gene polymorphism and risk of IS, under overall dominant model  (  $\mathrm{{OR}}\!=\!1.08$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.98–1.19), recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.91$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!0.81\!-\!\!1.02)$  ), and allelic model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.89$  ,  $95\%$   CI   $0.76{-}1.05)$   respectively. Upon conducting subgroup analysis  on the basis of ethnicity of the study population, no significant association was observed in the Asian population  under dominant   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.15$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.98–1.35) and allelic  models   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.89$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.70–1.12) respectively. However, a protective association was observed under the recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.80$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.66–0.97) [Figs.  2 G,  3 G,  4 G] [Table  2 ]. Also in Caucasian population no significant  association was observed under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.07$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.89–1.30), recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.98$  ,   $95\%$   CI   $0.84{-}1.13)$   and allelic model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.89$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.70–1.14)  respectively [Figs.  2 G,  3 G,  4 G] [Table  2 ].  

# Relationship between PDE4D SNP 87 gene  polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk  

We conducted a meta-analysis for 27 eligible studies. In the  overall population, no significant association was observed  between SNP87 and IS under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.98$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.95–1.02), recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,0.99$  ,   $95\%$   CI  0.94–1.03), and allelic model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.04$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.97–1.12)  respectively. Eighteen independent analyses of Asian and  nine independent analyses of Caucasian populations were  conducted. Subgroup analysis on the basis of ethnicity of  study population observed no significant association in the  Asian population under dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.98$  ,  $95\%$   CI  0.93–1.02), recessive model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.99$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.94–1.05)  and allelic model (OR—1.06,   $95\%$   CI 0.95–1.19) respectively [Figs.  2 C,  3 C,  4 C] [Table  2 ]. Also in the Caucasian  population, no significant association was observed under  dominant model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.99$  ,  $95\%$   C  $\mathrm{\DeltaI\,0.94{-}1.05})$  ), recessive  model   $(\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,0.98$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.90–1.06) and allelic model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.02$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.94–1.10) respectively [Figs.  2 C,  3 C,  4 C] [Table  2 ].  

# Publication bias  

For SNPs 45, 32, 41, 26, 56, 83, 87, 89, publication bias arising from the literature was qualitatively estimated by funnel  plots and quantitatively examined by Begg’s and Egger’s  test. It was observed that all the plots were roughly symmetrical, indicating no publication bias was present as shown in  the supplementary file as figures: S1-A, S2-A, S3-A, S4-A,  S5-A, S6-A, S7-A and S8-A. In addition, Begg’s and Egger’s  test did not have any significant p values for the different  effect sizes (p value  $>\!0.05$  ).  

# Sensitivity analyses  

Moreover, sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the  influence of each of the SNPs (SNP 45, 32, 41, 26, 56, 83,  87, 89) on the overall study by sequential omission of each  eligible study. By removing individual studies, no statistical variation of pooled OR was seen. Our result indicated  that no study influenced the quality of the pooled ORs and  the current meta-analysis was reliable and robust [Figures:  S1-B, S2-B, S3-B, S4-B, S5-B, S6-B, and S7-B].  

# Meta‑regression analysis  

Meta-regression analysis based on the quality score for the  relationship between PDE4D SNP45 gene polymorphism  and the risk of IS did not confirm any deviation from the  findings of the meta-analysis   $(\mathtt{p}\!=\!0.86)$  ) [Figures: S1-C,  S2-C, S3-C, S4-C, S5-C, S6-C, S7-C, and S8-B].  

# Discussion  

The current systematic review and meta-analysis involving  47 studies consisted of 20,644 IS cases and 23,201 controls.  The association between eight PDE4D SNPs (45, 32, 41, 26,  56, 83, 87, 89) and the risk of IS was analyzed. For SNP83,  we included 29 eligible studies, comprising 10,639 cases and  14,234 controls. SNP83 was associated with a statistically  increased risk of IS in overall analysis   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.22$  ,   $95\%$   CI  1.04–1.42) under the allelic model. Moreover, we found a  significant association in the subgroup analysis of the Asian  population in the allelic model of the polymorphism (OR— 1.20,   $95\%$   CI 1.05–1.37). In a previously published metaanalysis by Wang et al., 2017 [ 61 ], a total of 26 studies were  included and a significant association was observed between  the SNP83 genetic polymorphism and risk of IS in the Asian  population under dominant (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.19$  ,  $95\%$   CI 1.02–1.38)  and allelic   $(\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.25$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.06–1.48) models. Moreover, Yan et al. [ 62 ] observed a significant association in  the overall population under dominant   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.15$  ,   $95\%$    CI 1.02–1.30), recessive (  $(\mathrm{OR}\,\!=\!1.21$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.02–1.42),  and allelic   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.19$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.06–1.33) models. On  subgroup analysis, a significant association was found in  the Asian population under dominant   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.20$  ,   $95\%$   CI  1.13–1.44), recessive   $(\mathrm{OR}\,\!=\!1.48$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.22–1.79), and  allelic   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.35$  ,  $95\%$   CI 1.16–1.57) models, respectively.  There was no significant association of SNP83 of PDE4D  in the Asian subgroup analysis in our study with the risk  of IS under the dominant and recessive genetic models. In  the studies by   $\mathrm{Nu}$   et al. [ 63 ] and Xue et al. [ 64 ], a significant association was seen in the overall analysis   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.45$  ,   $95\%$   CI 1.19–1.76 and  $\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.42$  ,  $95\%$   CI 1.44–1.77, respectively). However, Yoon et al. [ 65 ] only reported the significance of SNP83 association with the risk of IS in the Asian  subgroup populations under all three genetic models. Our  study did not find any overall significance of SNP83 with the  risk of IS. Moreover, the Caucasian populations did not have  any significant association of SNP83 in PDE4D and IS risk.  

For SNP45, we observed that the PDE4D gene was not  significantly associated with IS in the overall analysis, which  is in accordance with the findings of Yoon et al. [ 65 ]. However, on conducting subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity, a significant association between SNP45 and risk of IS  was found in the Asian population, only under the recessive  model   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!2.06$  ,  $95\%$   CI 1.31–3.23). A meta-analysis by  Zhang et al. [ 66 ] involving 8731 cases and 10,756 controls  showed no significant association of SNP56 in PDE4D with  the risk of IS, which is consistent with the findings of our  study. Yoon et al. [ 65 ] also observed no significant association in their meta-analysis. The analysis of SNP56 consisting  of 13 published studies with 6064 cases and 9612 controls,  failed to find an association between SNP56 gene polymorphism and risk of IS. The inclusion of SNP87 with 27  studies comprised of 12,651 cases and 16,133 controls also  demonstrated that there was no relation between SNP87 and  IS. Liang et al. [ 67 ] did not find any significance for SNP87  polymorphism in PDE4D and the risk of IS after incorporating data from 18 studies with 8363 cases and 12,223 controls. Moreover, Xu et al. [ 64 ] also reported no observable  associations between SNP87 PDE4D polymorphism and  risk of IS. The present meta-analysis on SNP87 also did not  show any association with increased risk of IS in the overall  population and the ethnicity subgroups. For SNPs 26 and 89,  no correlation was observed with increased or decreased risk  of IS among Asian or European populations [ 65 ]. We also  did not observe any significant association of SNP26 under  any of the genetic models of PDE4D with IS risk for Asian  and Caucasian ethnicities. However, SNP89 of PDE4D has  a significant association with the risk of IS in the Asian  population under dominant and recessive models in our  meta-analysis, providing a correlation of SNP89 in patients  of Asian descent. We also reported the analysis of two additional SNPs, 32 and 41, which were not included in previous  meta-analyses. Although SNP 32 was not associated with  any significant risk of IS, SNP41 of PDE4D showed significant protective association with IS in the Asian subgroup  under the recessive model genetic correlation. Although,  the sample sizes for these two SNPs were relatively lower,  further studies are warranted to establish their association  with IS path o physiology. The detailed effect sizes of the different meta-analyses previously published on different SNPs  of PDE4D have been depicted in Table  3 .  

We included eight SNPs in our meta-analysis which  accounts for the largest meta-analysis on PDE4D done to  date for analyzing the association of the risk of IS occurrence. Unlike previous studies, we did not find any significant association between the eight SNPs of PDE4D with  the risk of IS in the overall population and the Caucasian  subgroup. The significance of risk association of PDE4D  polymorphism with IS was observed in the Asian population under specific genetic models in SNPs 45, 83, and 89.  Moreover, SNP45 showed a protective association against  IS in the Asian population. Polymorphism in PDE4D is  diverse, and its relation to the associated risk of cerebral  ischemic stroke has been quite intriguing. Despite the heterogeneity in sample size, the overall effect size of the studies showed a significant association in the results without  any deviation. The risk conferred by the SNPs of the gene is  non-significant in the overall and the Caucasian population.  Although the Asian population is predisposed towards IS  risk associated with specific polymorphisms of PDE4D, several elements need to be conferred upon, which could have  added possible confounding effects to the resultant effect  size. Interest in PDE4D stems from its significant involvement in the path o physiology of IS governing inflammation  and structural damage to the neural architecture. SNPs 39  and 45 are found to be involved in small vessel infarction  in an isolated Caucasian population group, suggesting the  allelic significance of PDE4D polymorphisms in IS physiology [ 21 ]. Moreover, targeted PDE4D inhibitors have also  depicted favorable outcomes through neuro plastic improvements and anti-inflammatory responses in stroke recovering  patients [ 68 ].  

Despite the significance of a large-scale meta-analysis,  our study had certain limitations to be considered for interpreting the results. First, there was significant heterogeneity  in the effect size of the outcomes. The studies had variable  sample sizes, which affected the individual strength of the  studies on overall results. Since most of the studies were of  case–control design, the sample sizes were usually  $<1000$  .  However, sensitivity analyses and meta-regression did not  depict any significant deviation from the observed effect  size, validating our results. Therefore, large-scale prospective cohort-based and case–control studies should be conducted to validate these polymorphisms. Second, most of  the included studies were from the Asian population, and  the observed overall effect size could have been affected by

their association. However, the number of Caucasian studies included in the meta-analysis was the highest to date,  and the effect size observed provides significant credibility.  Third, the effect of con founders such as age, sex, and IS  subtypes was not analyzed in the study, which could have  impacted the desired outcome and overall heterogeneity.  Lastly, unpublished or ongoing studies were not incorporated in the analysis, possibly introducing selection bias in  the observed effect size.  

# Conclusion  

The association between PDE4D gene polymorphism and  the risk of IS is debatable. The present meta-analysis showed  some possible associations of PDE4D with the risk of IS  in Asian populations while other studies did not. Further  large-scale genome-wide association studies are warranted  to ascertain the association of PDE4D gene polymorphism  and IS risk.
