Although stroke is a common cause of death and a major cause of disability all over the world, genetic components of common forms of ischemic stroke are largely unknown. To identify susceptibility genes of athero thr ombo tic stroke, we performed a large case–control association study and a replication study in a total of 2775 cases with a the roth rom bot ic stroke and 2839 controls. Through the analysis in 860 cases and 860 ageand sex-matched controls, we found that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2280887, in the ARHGEF10  gene was sign i cant ly associated with a the roth rom bot ic stroke even after the adjustment of multiple testing by a permutation test [unadjusted    $\pmb{P}=1.2\times10^{-6}$  , odds ratio  $=1.80$  ,   $\pmb{95\%}$   conﬁdence interval  $(\mathsf{C l})=1.42\!-\!2.28]$  . This association was replicated in independent 1915 cases and 1979 controls. Subsequent ﬁne mapping found another three SNPs which showed similar association due to strong linkage d is equilibrium to rs2280887   $(r^{2}\!>\!0.95)$  . In the functional analyses of these four highly associated SNPs, using luciferase assay and electro ph ore tic mobility shift assay we found that rs4376531 affected  ARHGEF10  transcript ional activity due to the different Sp1-binding afﬁnity. In small GTPase activity assay, we found that a gene product of  ARHGEF10  spec i call y activated RhoA. A population-based cohort study revealed the subjects with rs4376531 CC or CG to increase the incidence of ischemic stroke (  $\pmb{P}=\pmb{0.033}$  , hazard ratio  $=1.79$  ,  $\pmb{95\%}$     ${\sf C I}=1.05\!-\!3.04)$  . Our data suggest that the functional SNP of  ARHGEF10  confers the susceptibility to a the roth rom bot ic stroke.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is a common cause of death and a major cause of disability all over the world (1). Particularly, in the countries having a larger proportion of older people, the burden has been increasing more sign i cant ly. Twin and family studies have indicated that the risk for ischemic stroke is related to multiple genetic and environmental factors (2). Ident i cation of susceptibility genes for ischemic stroke is expected to elucidate new path o physiological mechanisms of the disease and to lead to the development of novel preventive measures. Although previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) reported several susceptibility genes (3,4), genetic components of common forms of ischemic stroke are still largely undetermined.  

Ischemic stroke is usually classiﬁed into several subtypes. From the aspects of path o physiological mechanisms and preventive measures, ischemic stroke can be classiﬁed into athero thr ombo tic stroke and card i oem boli c stroke (3,5,6). A the roth rom bot ic stroke is mainly caused by atherosclerosis in arteries of various sizes, and the main preventive measure is the control of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dys lipid emi a and smoking. In contrast, card i oem boli c stroke is mainly caused by cardiac diseases such as atrial brillat ion and valvular heart disease, and the main preventive measure is the use of anticoagulant s.  

As for the genetics of these two subtypes, Jerrard-Dunne et al . showed that the genetic component of a the roth rom bot ic stroke is stronger than that of card i oem boli c subtype, and suggested that the genetic study might be more efﬁcient by focusing on a the roth rom bot ic stroke (7). Therefore, we performed a large-scale case–control association study in a Japanese population (8,9) by focusing on a the roth rom bot ic stroke and identiﬁed a gene encoding guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10 ( ARHGEF10 ) on chromosome 8p23 as a new susceptibility gene for a the roth rom bot ic stroke. We found that a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of this gene affects its transcriptional activity by altering Sp1-binding afﬁnity. Furthermore, small GTPase activity assay showed that a gene product of  ARHGEF10  spec i call y activates RhoA. Since RhoA–Rho kinase pathway has an important role for the pathogen es is of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis, the functional SNP of  ARHGEF10  may be involved in the susce pti bil it y to the development of ischemic stroke.  

# RESULTS  

# Case–control association study  

We previously performed a two-stage association analysis using 1112 cases with ischemic stroke and 1112 age- and sexmatched controls by examining  $52\,\,608$   gene-based tag-SNPs selected from the JSNP database (8,9). To identify SNPs possibly associated with a the roth rom bot ic stroke, we further analyzed candidate SNPs by focusing on 860 cases with a the roth rom bot ic stroke and 860 age- and sex-matched controls (Set 1). We found that an SNP rs2280887 in intron 17 of  ARHGEF10  on chromosome 8p23 was found to be strongly   associated with a the roth rom bot ic stroke   $(P=1.2\times10^{-6}$  for dominant model; Table 1). This association remained signiﬁ- cant after a permutation test for the adjustment of multiple testing   $P=0.0006)$  . Although this SNP revealed a weak association even when we analyzed all ischemic stroke cases, no association was observed in the case of cardioembolic stroke (Supplementary Material, Table S1).  

We subsequently selected and genotyped 93 tag-SNPs across the  ARHGEF10  gene selected from phase II of HapMap JPT data. We found an SNP rs4480162 in intron 17 of  ARHGEF10  to be in absolute linkage d is equilibrium

 (LD) with rs2280887 (  $D^{\prime}=1.0$   and    $r^{2}=1.{\overline{{0}}}$  ) and

  ${{10}^{-7}}$  y associated with a the roth rom bot ic stroke (   for dominant model; Table 1). LD analysis showed  $(P=6.9\,\times$   ¼  ' that these two SNPs, rs4480162 and rs2280887, were located in a small LD block (block A) spanning   $15.7\;\mathrm{k\mathbf{b}}$  region, which corresponds to a region from intron 15 to intron 18 of  ARHGEF10  (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). None of the remaining 92 tag-SNPs showed signiﬁcant association with the disease. We subsequently searched for variants in this   $15.7\;\mathrm{kb}$   region by direct sequencing using 48 affected individuals. This re sequencing identiﬁed a total of 81 variants, of which 50 variants were already registered in dbSNP database, and 31 variants were new. After the exclusion of the variants genotyped or with minor allele frequency (MAF) of  ${<}0.05$  , we genotyped 43 additional SNPs. Figure 1 shows the result of ﬁne mapping around the candidate region of ARHGEF10 . The association of the SNPs with the disease was limited to the block A region of  ARHGEF10 . In block A, additional two SNPs, rs35234164 and rs4376531, were found to have signiﬁcant associations similar to rs2280887 (Fig. 1C and Table 1). rs4376531 was only two bases apart from rs4480162, and these SNPs were absolutely linked with rs2280887. rs35234164 was a one-base insertion/deletion (T/ del) polymorphism located at intron 16 and strongly linked with other three SNPs (each pairwise    $D^{\prime}=1.0$   and    $r^{2}=$  0.95). No other SNP in block A was associated with atherothrombotic stroke. These four SNPs were found to be associated with a the roth rom bot ic stroke in another case–control set of 1915 cases and 1979 controls (Set 2,    $P=0.010$   for dominant model; Table 1). The results of association analyses of those SNPs under allele and recessive models are shown in Supplementary Material, Table S2.  

# Susceptible allele of rs4376531 affects  ARHGEF10 transcriptional activity through the difference in Sp1-binding afﬁnity  

The four SNPs were located at intron 16 or 17 and mapped  ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{kb}$   ap  from   $5^{\prime}$  -untranslated region (UTR) and   $50\,\mathrm{kb}$  apart from 3 -UTR. None of the four SNPs was located in splice donor, acceptor or branch sites of intron 16 or 17. Furthermore, the UCSC Genome Browser database indicated no additional annotated gene or non-coding RNA in the block A region. We hypothesized that some of these SNPs might exert some effect on transcription and prepared  $5^{\prime}$  -end biotinlabeled oli go nucleotide probes that were derived from the genomic sequences corresponding to these SNPs. Although rs4480162 and rs4376531 were absolutely linked and only haplotypes of C-G and G-C were existed in our population, we also synthesized rs4480162_C/rs4376531_C and rs 4480162 G/rs 4376531 G probes to elucidate the function of each SNP. Electro ph ore tic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments using these oli go nucleotides with nuclear extract of LoVo cells, in which the expression of ARHGEF10  gene transcript is high, found a shifted band of a DNA–protein complex with a strong intensity in lanes corresponding to the susceptible allele of rs4376531 (C-G and G-G, Fig. 2A). This shifted band was weak in lanes corresponding to the non-susceptible allele (C-C and G-C). Although we also observed shifted bands for other oligonucleotides, no difference in the intensity between susceptible and non-susceptible alleles was observed. The competition assay with the unlabeled oli go nucleotides demonstrated that the oli go nucleotides containing the susceptibility allele of rs4376531 (C-G and G-G) inhibited the formation of DNA– protein complex in a dose-dependent manner but the other oligo nucleotides (C-C and G-C) did not (Fig. 2B), suggesting that some nuclear proteins spec i call y bound to the DNA fragment corresponding to the susceptible allele of rs4376531. To identify which transcriptional factor binds to this susceptible allele, we added excess amount of unlabeled oli go nucleotides corresponding to consensus sequences of various transcriptional factors as competitor and found that the unlabeled Sp1-binding consensus oli go nucleotide effectively inhibited the formation of the DNA–protein complex (Fig. 2C).

For additive genetic model, we used logistic regression analysis coding genotypes 11, 12 and 22 as 2, 1 and 0, respectively. OR, odds ratio; CI, conﬁdence interval.  

Moreover, when we added anti-Sp1 antibody to the mixture, the band was further shifted to a higher molecular position, indicating the speciﬁc binding of the Sp1 protein to the susceptible allele of rs4376531. Similar shifted band was observed when we used rs 4480162 G/rs 4376531 G probe (data not shown).  

To test whether rs4376531 affects the  ARHGEF10  transcript ional activity, we performed a luciferase assay using LoVo cells. We subcloned the sequences corresponding C-G and G-C EMSA probes into the pGL3-promoter vector. Luciferase activity was enhanced in the cells trans fec ted with the reporter vector containing the susceptible allele of rs4376531 but the enhancement was low in the cells transfected with the vector containing the non-susceptible allele (Fig. 2D). These ﬁndings indicated that rs4376531 might affect  ARHGEF10  transcriptional activity through the difference in the binding afﬁnity of Sp1 transcriptional factor.  

Although the function of ARHGEF10 is not well understood, ARHGEF10 is a member of the family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which regulate the activity of small Rho GTPases by catalyzing the exchange of bound GDP by GTP. To elucidate the role of ARHGEF10 in the pathogen es is of a the roth rom bot ic stroke, we examined the effect of ARHGEF10 on the activation of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 by small GTPase activity assay. As shown in Figure 3, over expression of ARHGEF10 led to an increase in the GTP-bounded RhoA, indicating that ARHGEF10 might activate RhoA. In contrast, over expression of ARHGEF10 had no effect on the GTP-bounded Rac1 or Cdc42. Since Sp1 is abundantly expressed in multiple tissues, the subjects with the disease-susceptible allele of rs4376531 are expected to have higher expression of ARHGEF10  transcripts and might result in the higher activity of RhoA–Rho kinase pathway.  

# rs4376531 increases the incidence of ischemic stroke  

Finally, we examined the effect of rs4376531 on the incidence of ischemic stroke using a population-based cohort study. During a 14-year follow-up of the cohort, 67 events of ﬁrstever ischemic stroke were observed among 1656 subjects without a history of stroke at baseline examination. Figure 4 shows Kaplan–Meier estimates of the incidence of ischemic stroke by rs4376531. The cumulative incidence was   $6.1\%$   in the subjects who had at least one susceptible allele and   $3.6\%$  in the subjects with the homozygous of non-susceptible allele (  $P=0.042$   for log-rank test). Age- and sex-adjusted risk of a the roth rom bot ic stroke was sign i cant ly higher in the subjects with susceptible allele of rs4376531 (adjusted  $P=0.033$  , hazard ratio  $=1.79$  ,   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval  $=$  1.05–3.04).  

# DISCUSSION  

In this study, we analyzed the data of a large-scale case– control association study by focusing on a the roth rom bot ic stroke. We found a new candidate locus, rs2280887, located in intron 17 of  ARHGEF10 . This SNP was sign i cant ly associated with a the roth rom bot ic stroke even after the adjustment of multiple testing, and the association was replicated in other case–control samples. Fine mapping of the  ARHGFE10 gene identiﬁed four highly linked SNPs (rs2280887, rs35234164, rs4480162 and rs4376531) as candidates with functional sign i can ce. Functional analysis of these four SNPs demonstrated that an SNP, rs4376531, altered the binding afﬁnity of the Sp1 transcriptional factor and might enhance the  ARHGEF10  transcriptional activity in individuals with the susceptible allele. We also found that ARHGEF10 spec i call y activated RhoA, which has an important role in various process of atherosclerosis. From these ﬁndings, we suggest that the subjects with the susceptible allele of rs4376531 in  ARHGEF10  will have higher expression of transcript and might have higher RhoA activity. Since RhoA–Rho kinase pathway is involved in the pathogen es is of atherosclerosis, the functional SNP of  ARHGEF10  might confer the development of a the roth rom bot ic stroke. A populationbased cohort study supported this hypothesis.  

Although several GWASs for ischemic stroke have been reported (3,4), they did not detect the association of SNPs in ARHGEF10  with ischemic stroke. Among the four highly associated SNPs in this study, rs4480162 and rs4376531 were registered in the HapMap database. From the database,

MAF of rs4480162 was 0.167 for CEU, 0.475 for YRI, 0.078 for CHB and 0.091 for JPT. Our sequence data showed that rs4376531 is absolutely linked with rs4480162 in the Japanese population; however, MAF of rs4376531 was 0 for CEU, 0.021 for YRI, 0 for CHB and 0 for JPT. These data speculate that the LD between causative variant (rs4376531) and other three SNPs might be different among different populations if the genotype data of CEU and YRI are correct. Moreover, our large-scale association study included rs2280887 as one of the 52 608 gene-based tag-SNPs selected from JSNP database. However, the current GWAS platforms do not contain all of the four SNPs even in Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 or Illumina Human1M-Duo BeadChip. Therefore, current GWASs using commercial chips cannot detect the association of SNPs in  ARHGEF10  and ischemic stroke.  

GEFs activate small GTPases in response to diverse extracellular stimuli and ultimately regulate numerous cellular responses (10). Small GTPases, which were identiﬁed as the master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, control a

Cell lysates were pulled down by GST-Rhotekin and subjected to immunoblot with anti-Myc antibody. Whole-cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibody to detect total RhoA and ARHGEF10, respectively. GTP-bound RhoA and total RhoA were quantiﬁed by the intensity of the bands using Multi Gauge software of an LAS-3000 system (bottom).

remarkable diversity of cell functions including contraction, motility, proliferation and apoptosis. Small GTPases act as molecular switches, which cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form (11). The Rho GEFs mediate the activation of small GTPases by promoting the release of GDP in exchange for GTP (12). ARHGEF10, a member of Rho GEFs, was identiﬁed by the sequencing of cDNA clones from the human brain (13) and found to be expressed not only in the brain but also in various tissues including the heart (14). A point mutation (T109I) of ARHGEF10 was reported to co-segregate in the family with slowed motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities of peripheral nerves with autosomal dominant inheritance (15). However, the function of ARHGEF10 is largely unknown. We found that ARHGEF10 spec i call y activated RhoA and might contribute to the development of a the roth rom bot ic stroke through the regulation of RhoA– Rho kinase activity. Recent linkage studies have demonstrated that several Rho GEFs might be involved in the pathogen es is of atherosclerosis. A linkage scan for type 2 diabetes has identiﬁed that non-synonymous SNPs in LARG and PDZ-Rho GEF are associated with insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance (16,17). Another linkage study has found kalirin gene as a candidate gene for early-onset coronary artery disease (18). These results suggest that polymorphisms of Rho GEFs affect small GTPase signaling pathway and result in the pathogen es is of human atherosclerosis.  

RhoA, which is the most characterized small GTPases (19), and one of its effectors, Rho-kinase, were reported to play an important role in the various processes of atherosclerosis including endo the li al dysfunction, in amma tion and vascular smoothmusclecellproliferation(20–24).Fromtheseaspects, drugs that inhibit RhoA–Rho kinase pathway such as Rho-kinase inhibitor (20) or statin (24) are already available in clinical setting. If our ﬁndings are conﬁrmed in further studies, we could expect to use RhoA–Rho kinase pathway inhibitors in the subjects with susceptible allele of ARHGEF10  SNP for the more effective prevention of atherothrombotic stroke.  

In conclusion, rs4376531 located in intron 17 of ARHGEF10  was sign i cant ly associated with a the roth r ombotic stroke. Individuals with the susceptible allele of the SNP might have a higher level of  ARHGEF10  transcript due to the higher binding-afﬁnity of Sp1 and might have higher RhoA–Rho kinase activity. This higher activity will ﬁnally result in the increased incidence of a the roth rom bot ic stroke

# Study populations  

For the large-scale case–control association study, cases with ischemic stroke were registered from seven medical centers in and around Fukuoka City, Japan, in 2004. Details of registration were described previously (8). Brieﬂy, all case subjects were diagnosed by stroke neurologists on the basis of detailed clinical features and ancillary laboratory examinations [such as brain imaging including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral angiography, echo car dio graph y and carotid duplex imaging]. Ischemic stroke was deﬁned as a sudden onset of non-convulsive and focal neurological deﬁcit persisting for    ${>}24\,\mathrm{h}$   without evidence of hemorrhagic stroke on brain imaging (CT or MRI). Ischemic stroke was further subdivided into a the roth rom bot ic stroke, card i oem boli c stroke and undetermined subtype. Subtypes of ischemic stroke were determined on the basis of the Class i cation of Cerebro vascular Disease III proposed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (25), as well as on the basis of the diagnostic criteria of the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) study (26) and Cerebral Embolism Task Force (27). Details of the diagnostic criteria of ischemic stroke subtypes have been described previously (8). Brieﬂy, small-artery occlusion (lacunar stroke) was diagnosed as the presence of a relevant brain stem or sub cortical hemispheric lesion with a diameter of    ${<}1.5$   cm demonstrated on brain imaging and no evidence of cerebral cortical or cerebellar impairment. Large artery at hero sclerotic stroke was diagnosed when the subjects had signiﬁcant stenosis   $(>50\%)$   or occlusion of a major cerebral artery with infarct size    $\geq1.5~\mathrm{cm}$   on brain imaging. The diagnosis of card i oem boli c stroke was made on the basis of primary and secondary clinical features suggestive of cardioembolic stroke as reported by the Cerebral Embolism Task Force (27). The category of undetermined subtype included all ischemic stroke cases for which the subtype could not be determined because of in suf cie nt clinical or morphological information. Both small-artery occlusion and large artery at hero sclerotic stroke were included in the phenotype of a the roth rom bot ic stroke. Subtypes of ischemic stroke were 860 in a the roth rom bot ic, 136 in card i oem boli c and 116 in undetermined subtype. Age- (within 5 years) and sex-matched control subjects were selected from the 3328 participants of the Hisayama screening survey between 2002 and 2003.  

For the replication study, case samples were selected from the BioBank Japan project (28). Among the subjects with ischemic stroke in the BioBank Japan, we selected 1915 cases that were diagnosed as a the roth rom bot ic stroke by brain imaging, same as the initial study. The remaining 1979 Hisayama participants who were not enrolled in the initial study were used as controls. Clinical characteristics of the study population in the two case–control sets were shown in Supplementary Material, Table S3.  

For the prospective cohort study, we used a cohort population of the Hisayama study established in 1988 (8). In this cohort, 2637 Hisayama residents aged    ${\geq}40$   years without a history of stroke or coronary heart disease were enrolled in 1988 and continuously followed up for 14 years until the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases or death. Among them, 1656 subjects participated in the examination between 2002 and 2003 were used in the present study.  

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by a standard method in both populations. Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects in both populations, and this study was approved by the ethics committees of the Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, and Yokohama Institute, RIKEN.  

# SNP selection and genotyping  

In the previous large-scale case–control association study, we used a two-stage approach to identify susceptibility genes of ischemic stroke. We ﬁrst genotyped 52 608 gene-based tag-SNPs selected from JSNP database using 188 cases and 188 age- and sex-matched controls. In the second stage, 1098 SNPs that showed  $P<0.01$   in the ﬁrst stage were genotyped in the remaining samples. Details of this large-scale association study were described previously (8). For this study, we combined the data of the ﬁrst and the second stage and re-analyzed by focusing on a the roth rom bot ic stroke using the matched case–control samples. All SNPs in the large-scale association study were genotyped using the multiplex PCR-based Invader assay (Third Wave Technologies) described previously (29). All genotypes were called by visual inspection, and we determined genotyped success as less than 10 undetermined samples in a 384-well-plate.  

For ﬁne mapping across  ARHGEF10 , we selected tag-SNPs from phase II of the HapMap JPT data by pairwise tagging method with the following criteria:    $r^{2}\dot{>0.8}$  ,   $\mathrm{MAF}>5\%$  and call rate    $>\!75\%$  . We genotyped SNPs using the multiplex PCR-based Invader assay or by direct sequencing of PCR products using ABI3700 capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems) according to standard protocols.

EMSA probe of 20 fmol was incubated with   $10~\upmu\mathrm{g}$   nuclear proteins for  $30\;\mathrm{{min}}$  at room temperature in binding buffer (  $5\:\mathrm{mm}$  HEPES,   $\mathrm{pH}~7.9$  ,   $0.05\;\mathrm{mm}$   EDTA,   $0.5~\upmu\mathrm{g}$   poly(dI/dC),   $50\:\mathrm{nm}$  KCl, 1 m M  dith io th re it ol and   $10\%$   glycerol). For the compe- tition assay, each 1–30-fold molar excess of unlabeled probes was added and incubated for another   $15\;\mathrm{{min}}$   at room temperature. For the supershift assay,   $2\ \upmu\mathrm{g}$   of rabbit polyclonal anti-human Sp1 antibody (sc-59X, Santa Cruz) was added and incubated for another   $60\;\mathrm{{min}}$   on ice. The mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a   $4\%$   polya cry l amide gel in   $0.5\times$   Tris–Borate–EDTA buffer at   $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . N ic acids were transferred to a ny mbran ond $\cdot N+$  þ ; Amersham Bioscience s) at 100 V for 60 min. Biotin-labeled probes were detected using Che mi luminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module (PIERCE, 89880) and analyzed with an LAS-3000 system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).  

# Luciferase reporter assay  

The same DNA sequences around rs4480162 and rs4376531 as the EMSA probes were subcloned into pGL3-promoter luciferase vector (Promega). We trans fec ted LoVo cells with  $500\;\mathrm{ng}$   of each reporter construct and   $50\,\mathrm{ng}$   of pRL-CMV vector (Promega) using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche). After  $48\;\mathrm{h}$  , we collected the cells and measured luciferase activities using Dual Luciferase Assay System (Toyo B-Net).  

# Small GTPase activity assay  

A plasmid designed to express full-length ARHGEF10 was obtained by cloning full-length human  ARHGEF10  cDNA into p3XFLAG-CMV-10 expression vector (SIGMA). We constructed three small GTPases over expression plasmids by cloning full-length human RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42 cDNA into pcDNA3.1/myc-His expression vector (Invitrogen). The cellular levels of GTP-loaded RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 were determined using GST fusion proteins containing the RhoGTPase-binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-RBD) (14-383, Upstate) or PAK-1 (GST-PBD) (14-325, Upstate) as described previously (30,31). In brief, pcDNA3.1-RhoAMyc or pcDNA3.1-Rac1-Myc or pcDNA3.1-Cdc42-Myc was co-trans fec ted into 293FT cells seeded in   $10\;\mathrm{{cm}}$   dishes with p3XFLAG-CMV-10-ARHGEF10 or the corresponding empty vector using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche). After being cultured for   $48\;\mathrm{h}$  , the cells were lysed in a buffer containing   $25~\mathrm{mM}$   HEPES, pH7.5,   $150\,\mathrm{{mm}\ N a C l}$  ,  $1\%$   Igepal CA-630,   $10\;\mathrm{{mm}\;\mathrm{{MgCl}}_{2}}$  ,   $1\:\mathrm{mm}$   EDTA,   $10\%$   glycerol and protease inhibitors, and the particular fraction was pelleted by cent ri fuga tion. The GTPase-containing super nat ant was then incubated for  $45\mathrm{-}60\;\mathrm{min}$   at  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   with GST fusion proteins bound to glut at hi one–Sepharose beads. After three times washing of the beads, bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and separated by SDS–PAGE. ARHGEF10 and the small GTPases were then detected by immuno blotting with commercially available speciﬁc anti-FLAG antibody (F3165, SIGMA,   $1\ \upmu\mathrm{g/ml})$  ) and anti-Myc antibody (562, MBL,   $1\ \upmu\mathrm{l/ml}$  ), respectively. Proteins reacting with primary antibodies were visualized by an enhanced che milu minescence system (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Amersham) for detecting species-matched secondary antibodies and analyzed with an LAS-3000 system. Quantitative analyses of immuno blots were performed using Multi Gauge version 2.02 software included in an LAS-3000 system.  

# Statistical analysis  

We assessed case–control association analysis by    $\chi^{2}$    test and Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. The shift of Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium was also tested by  $\chi^{2}$    test or Fisher’s exact test. In the association analyses, we used allele, dominant and recessive models. All statistical analyses were performed without the adjustment of age and sex. Metaanalyses of the two case–control sample sets were performed using Mantel–Haenszel method (ﬁxed effect analysis). He te rogen ei ties across the population were assessed using Cochran’s    $\mathcal{Q}$   test. For the adjustment of multiple testing in the discovery phase, we performed a random permutation test with   $10\:000$   replications using MULTTEST procedure of SAS software version 9.12 (SAS Institute). LD were calculated as    $D^{\prime}$    or  $r^{2}$  , and haplotype blocks were deﬁned by Gabriel’s criteria (32) using Haploview version 4.0 (Broad Institute). Luciferase assay data and small GTPase activity assay data were analyzed by Student’s    $t\cdot$  -test.
