# Abstract  

Background:  Genetic variants in Ph os ph odi est erase 4D ( PDE4D ) and 5-lip oxygen as e activating protein ( ALOX5AP ) have been shown to confer risk of Ischemic Cerebro vascular Disease (ICVD) in Iceland. We investigated whether these variants associate with ICVD in Sweden. Methods:  Previously published    $P D E4D$   and    $A L O X5A P$   gene variants were genotyped for cases (685) and controls (751). In  PDE4D  this consisted of SNP41, SNP45 and micro satellite AC008818-1 and in  ALOX5AP  four SNPs that define the HapA haplotype.  

Results:  The    $P D E4D$   SNPs, showed a non-significant risk in the ICVD group which increased for the Large Artery Atherosclerosis subtype

 (SNP45:  $\mathrm{RR}\!=\!1.43$  ,  $\scriptstyle P=0.063$  , SNP41:  $\mathrm{RR}\!=\!1.57$  ,    $P{=}0.018$  ). The SNP haplotype GA (SNP45, SNP41) showed an increased risk for LAA

 (  $\mathrm{RR}\!=\!1.58$  ,  $P{=}0.016$  ) and the combined LAA and Car dio embolism (CE) (  $\mathrm{RR}\!=\!1.34$  ,  $P{=}0.031$  ) subgroups. As the SNPs are in strong LD, this haplotype corresponds to the complement of the protective haplotype in the Icelandic study. No allele of the micro satellite marker, showed association to stroke or any subtype and nor did the Icelandic  PDE4D  at-risk haplotype (GA0). We did not confirm the association between  ALOX5AP  HapA haplotype and ICVD, but a non-significant risk was observed in the LAA subtype.  

Conclusion:  Our PDE4D findings although non-significant considering the number of markers and phenotypes tested, are consistent with the association observed in the original study, with a trend observed in the whole ICVD group, which was strengthened in the stroke subtype LAA and the combined group of LAA and CE stroke. This supports the notion that  $P D E4D$   contributes to the risk of developing stroke.  $\copyright$   2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

# 1. Introduction  

A number of different path o genetic events may lead to ischemic cerebro vascular disease (ICVD), including atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, cardiac arrhythmia s, and hypercoagulation. In turn, these conditions are also dependent on a variety of different underlying conditions some of which are inherited and others are due to exogenous factors. Thus, ICVD is a typical multi factorial disease and several genetic factors may contribute to the risk of the disease.  

A large group of candidate genes have been studied in ICVD. The results have varied, possibly due to factors such as differences in inclusion criteria, definition of stroke and subtypes, age, ethnic origin and number of patients.  

Genetic variations in two genes have recently been shown to associate to common forms of stroke in Iceland, the Ph os ph odi est erase 4D gene ( PDE4D ) and 5-Lipoxygenase activating protein ( ALOX5AP )  [1,2] . Both these genes were identified through genome-wide linkage analysis and subsequent case – control association studies in an Icelandic population. Two haplotypes in  PDE4D , spanning the first exon of isoform PD4D7, were found to confer risk and protection, respectively, primarily in a subgroup of car dio geni c

(i.e. card i oem boli c) and carotid stroke (i.e. large artery atherosclerosis) patients. Likewise a haplotype spanning  ALOX5AP , HapA, was shown to confer risk of both myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in Iceland  [2] .  

The aim of this study was to determine whether the variants in  PDE4D  and  ALOX5AP  that associates with stroke in Iceland also confer risk of ischemic cerebro vascular disease in Swedish ICVD patients. For  PDE4D  we tested the at-risk and protective variants (spanning PDE4D7) and for  ALOX5AP  the HapA haplotype.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. Ischemic Cerebro vascular Disease patients  

A total of 685 patients (mean age±SD:  $68.3\pm11.3$   years,  $56\%$   men) with ischemic stroke or TIA (collectively labelled ICVD) attending the stroke unit or the stroke outpatient clinic at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge unit in Stockholm, Sweden were recruited from 1996 to 2002 as part of an ongoing genetic epidemiology study, the South Stockholm Ischemic Stroke Study (SSISS). All patients had clinically relevant investigations performed, including brain imaging with computed tomography (CT) or/and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as ancillary diagnostic investigations including duplex ultra sonography of the carotid and vertebral arteries, echo car dio graph y, MR-angiography, CT-angiography and standardized blood tests. Clinical data and common investigations are listed in  Table 1 .  

Patients were classified into ICVD subtypes according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification by a physician reviewing original imaging and data  [3] . The TOAST subtypes include a) Large Artery Atherosclerosis (LAA), b) Car dio embolism (CE), c) Small Arterial Occlusion (SAO) i.e. lacunar infarction, d) Other a etiologies (OA) and e) Unknown cause (including multiple potential causes). Frequencies of TOAST subtypes in our cohort are shown in  Table 2 .  

The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of Karolinska Institutet (Dnr 286/96 and 08/02).  

# 2.2. Controls  

The controls used in this study are population-based controls recruited from the same region in central Sweden as the patients, representing the general population in this area. In total 751 Swedish individuals (mean age  $:\pm\mathrm{SD}$  :   $46.8\pm$  14.9 years,   $59\%$   men) were recruited, either blood donors

 (recruited in 2001) or healthy volunteers (collected in 1990 – 1994) recruited by the clinical chemistry department at the Karolinska University Hospital to represent a normal reference population. Information for gender and age at sampling was available for the controls.  

# 2.3. PDE4D and ALOX5AP genotyping  

Markers defining the previously published  PDE4D and  ALOX5AP  variants were genotyped for both cases and controls. In  PDE4D  this consisted of two SNPs, SNP41 (rs12153798) and SNP45 (rs12188950) and one microsatellite marker, AC008818-1. In  ALOX5AP  the four SNPs defin- ing the HapA are: SNPs SG13S25 (rs17222814), SG13S114

 (rs17222772), SG13S89 (rs17216522), and SG13S32

 (rs17222828). The genotype distribution of all SNPs was found to be in Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium both in cases and controls.  

# 2.4. Statistics  

For single-marker association and haplotype analysis, we used the program NEMO  [1] , which handles missing genotypes through a likelihood procedure, using the expectation

maximization algorithm as a computational tool to estimate haplotype frequencies. Under the null hypothesis, the affected individuals and controls were assumed to have identical haplotype frequencies. Under the alternative hypotheses, the candidate at-risk haplotype was allowed to have a higher frequency in the affected individuals than in controls, and the ratios of frequencies of all other haplotypes were assumed to be the same in both groups. Likelihoods were maximized separately under both hypotheses, and a corresponding 1-degree-of-freedom likelihood ratio statistic was used to evaluate statistical significance. The same method is also used when we test the markers individually for association in order to ensure that the same data/individuals were used to generate results for all the tests, allowing meaningful comparisons among the different markers/haplotypes. As some of the markers did not have high genotype yield, genotypes from other markers in the same gene were used to provide some partial information on the missing genotypes  [4] . Instead of testing an allele A of a marker individually for association, we test all haplotypes that include allele A and other nearby markers as a group for association to the disease. This method is especially useful for the markers in PDE4D, which are in very strong linkage d is equilibrium.  

The relative risk of a haplotype is calculated using the multiplicative model, in which the risk corresponding to each of the two chromosomes multiplies. All    $P$  -values presented are two-sided. Allelic rather than carrier frequencies for micro satellites, SNPs and haplotypes are presented. To adjust for the number of subgroups/haplotypes tested we use simulations. In each simulation we randomly assign individuals to the study cohorts, preserving the number of individuals in each sub-group, and repeat the all the association tests. This procedure was repeated 1000 times and an adjusted  $P_{-}$  -value calculated as the number of simulations that gave a  $P$  -value, for any of the haplotype/marker tested, equal to or lower than the  $P$  -value for the original cohort.

# 3.1. The Swedish ICVD population  

The ICVD patients conformed to the Swedish National Stroke Registry in frequencies of the registered risk factors (atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking) for Karolinska University Hospital in Huddinge  [5] . Frequencies of TOAST-subtypes were similar to recently published cohorts  [6] .  

# 3.2. Association to the PDE4D genetic variants  

We first tested the association of SNP45, SNP41 and AC008818-1 to Swedish ICVD and to the different TOAST subtypes as was done in the Icelandic study ( Table 3  and Supplementary Table 1). The population allele frequencies of the SNPs were similar in Sweden and Iceland. However a difference was observed in the frequency of two alleles

of micro satellite AC008818-1, (alleles    $^{-8}$   and 0), both of which showed significant association in the Icelandic cohort (Supplementary Table 1). While none of the five alleles of AC008818-1 showed significant association to stroke in the Swedish cohort, both common alleles of the SNPs showed a slight increased risk for the whole ICVD patient group and consistent with the Icelandic results the risk increased for the LAA subtype   $\mathrm{RR}\!=\!1.43$  ,    $\scriptstyle P=0.063$  , 0.55, and   $\mathrm{RR}\!=\!1.57$  ,  $P{=}\,0.018$  ,    $P_{\mathrm{adj}}\!=\!0.24$  , for SNP45 and SNP41 respectively, Icelandic data is presented in Supplementary Table 2). Here  $P_{\mathrm{adj}}$   is a    $P\cdot$  -value adjusted for the number of haplotypes and sub-groups tested for both genes using simulation. The two SNPs, and the  $^{-8}$   allele of AC008818-1, are in strong linkage d is equilibrium (LD) (pairwise  $R^{2}{>}0.8$  ) although the LD is stronger in the Icelandic cohort ( Table 4 ); hence they are expected to show similar results.  

We then tested for association the predefined protective and the at-risk haplotypes ( Table 3 ). The Icelandic at-risk haplotype is primarily defined by allele 0 of AC008818-1; this allele does not show any association in the Swedish cohort, neither to ICVD nor any of the subgroups. Consistent with this we do not observe association in the Swedish cohort to the atrisk haplotype GA0. In Iceland the protective haplotype could be defined by the minor alleles of either of the SNPs (A and G for SNP45 and SNP41 respectively) or by the    $^{-8}$   allele of AC008818-1. When we tested the haplotype, AG-8, the RR in Swedish ICVD is 0.96 and the strongest protective effect is observed in the LAA group,   ${\mathrm{RR}}\!=\!0.71$   $(P{=}0.074,P_{\mathrm{adj}}{=}0.62)$  , Table 4 . These results, although non-significant, are consistent with the association observed in the Icelandic cohort to the protective haplotype, both with respect to the direction of the effect and the stroke subgroup that shows the strongest association, although the magnitude of the effect is less than is observed in the Icelandic cohort (  $\mathrm{RR}\!=\!0.71$   compared to  $\mathrm{RR\,}{=}\,0.57$   in Iceland, see Supplementary Table 2 for the Icelandic results). As mentioned above, we do not observe significant association to the Icelandic at-risk haplotype (GA0), however, by excluding the micro satellite the two SNP haplotype, GA, showed increased risk in the LAA and LAA/ CE subgroups ( Table 3 ),  $P{=}0.016$     $(P_{\mathrm{adj}}\!=\!0.21)$   and    $P{=}0.031$   $(P_{\mathrm{adj}}\!=\!0.35)$  , respectively. This haplotype is close to being the complement of the protective haplotype in Sweden as these two SNPs are in very strong LD   $(R^{2}{=}0.92)$  ).  

# 3.3. Association to the ALOX5AP genetic variants  

The  ALOX5AP  HapA haplotype confers risk of both MI and stroke in Iceland  [2]  and has been associated with stroke in Scotland  [7] . We tested HapA in our Swedish stroke group ( Table 5 ). No association was observed to ischemic stroke in general but an increased risk was observed in the LAA group, although non-significant (  $\mathrm{RR}\!=\!1.34$  ,    $P{=}0.11$  ,  $P_{\mathrm{adj}}\!=\!0.75$  ,  Table 4 ).  

# 3.4. Discussion  

Our  PDE4D  findings for the protective variant, although not significant after adjusting for the haplotypes/sub-groups tested, are consistent with the original study, where a trend was observed in the whole ICVD group, which was strengthened in the subtype of stroke most closely related to atherosclerosis i.e. LAA and in the combined group of LAA and CE. No association was observed to SAO also consistent with the Icelandic results. The at-risk PDE4D variant observed in the Icelandic study was not associated with stroke in the Swedish cohort; however, the at-risk variant is primarily defined by the micro satellite AC008818-1 and, unlike in Iceland, no allele of the micro satellite was associated with stroke in Sweden.  

The  ALOX5AP  variant, HapA, did not associate to ICVD in Sweden. However, a non-significant risk was seen to the LAA subtype.  

Several  PDE4D  and  ALOX5AP  studies have been published recently  [7 – 20] . We have compiled the results for the studies that have tested the two  PDE4D  SNPs, SNP45 and SNP41, and the HapA  ALOX5AP  haplotype; and present them together with our results in Supplementary Table 3.  

A possible limitation of this study is the matching of the control and the patient groups. The controls are on average 20 years younger than the patients. This age difference

Shown is the haplotype frequency of HapA (Frq) , the relative risk (RR), Confidence Intervals (CI) and the two-sided  $P$  -value for the association with stroke and its sub phenotypes.  $\mathrm{ICVD}=$  Ischemic stroke or TIA, LAA  $=$  large artery atherosclerosis,  $\mathrm{CE}=$  car dio embolism, SAO  $=$  small arterial occlusion. Genotype yield for the markers were as follows (marker name: genotyped  $\#$   controls/# patients with ICVD); SG13S25: 669/665, SG13S114: 661/661, SG13S89: 435/657, SG13S32: 604/653.  

between the controls and the patients would, however, only affect the association analysis if the variants tested had significant age dependence in the general population. This has been studied in the Icelandic population where large number of individuals has been typed for both the PDE4D and ALOX5AP variants, but no age or gender difference has been observed (unpublished work). To minimise bias due to potential population structure both the controls and the patients have been recruited from the same geographical region within Sweden. Furthermore, the same population controls as used in this study have also been used as part of the Nordic Multiple Sclerosis cohort, collected in Stockholm. In that study, approximately 60 markers, unlinked to the disease phenotype and distributed across the genome, were typed in 300 patients and controls. With those markers no population stratification was detected in the cohort (unpublished results).  

In conclusion, although we observe a weaker effect in a Swedish cohort than originally reported in Iceland, our work supports the notion that genetic variants of  PDE4D  contribute to the risk of developing ischemic stroke through its effect on stroke on the background of large artery atherosclerosis. However, it is worth pointing out that although the effect is weak the at-risk SNP variant is very common hence this corresponds to a substantial population attributed risk (e.g.  $39\%$  for LAA/CE).
