# ABSTRACT  

The aim of our study was to investigate the association of interleukin-17A (IL17A) polymorphisms with IL-17A serum levels and risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in a  Chinese population. 392 IS patients and 443 controls were included in this study.  The polymorphisms of IL-17A gene were determined by Snapshot SNP genotyping  assay and DNA sequencing. Serum IL-17A levels were measured by enzyme-linked  immuno s or bent assay (ELISA). We found that the G allele, GA and GG genotypes, and  GA/GG vs. AA model of rs2275913 polymorphism were associated with increased risk  of IS even after adjusted by clinical characters such as age, gender and diabetes (G vs.  A:   $\scriptstyle{0\!\!{\mathrm{R}}=\!\!{\pm}1.27}$  ,  $\bf{95\%}$   CI,   $\mathbf{1.05}\!\sim\!\!\mathbf{1.54}$  ,  $\pmb{P}{=}\pmb{0.014};$  ; GA vs. AA:   ${\bf o r\!R}\!\!=\!{\bf1.72},$  ,   $\bf{95\%}$   CI,   $\pmb{1.05\sim}2.81,$  ,   $\scriptstyle{\pmb{P}}={\pmb{0}}.{\pmb{032}};$   GG vs. AA:   ${\bf\Omega}_{\mathrm{{\bfR}=1.99,}}$  ,  $\bf{95\%}$   CI,   $\pmb{1.08}\!\sim\!\pmb{3.67}$  ,  $\scriptstyle{\pmb{P}}={\pmb{0}}.{\pmb{0}}2{\pmb{8}},$  ; GA/GG vs. AA:  ${\bf\Omega\mathfrak{o r e l.78}},$     $\bf{95\%}$   CI,   $\pmb{1.11}\!\sim\!\pmb{2.86},$  ,  $\pmb{P}{=}\pmb{0.017}$  ). Serum IL-17A levels were increased in IS patients  compared with controls   $(P{<}0.01)$  ). Individuals carrying rs2275913 GA or GG genotype  present higher serum IL-17A levels compared with the rs 2275913 A A genotype in  the IS group (  $(P{<}0.01)$  . In conclusion, this is the first study reporting the rs2275913  polymorphism as a risk factor for IS, which may be partly explained by influencing  the levels of IL-17A cytokine.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is a major cause of death and a common  cause of long-term disability in the world [1–3]. In China,  stroke has turned up to be a heavy burden of family and  society, with about 2.5 million new cases and 1.6 million  death each year [4]. Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most  common type of stroke, accounting for more than   $80\%$    of all stroke [5]. Until now, the exact etiology of IS has  not been fully elucidated. Several non-genetic factors such  as age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking,  alcohol abuse and hypercholesterolemia have been  demonstrated to play crucial role in the pathogen es is of  IS. Moreover, data from family and twins researches have  revealed that genetic factors may also play a role in the  pathogen es is of IS [6–8].  

Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a member of the  IL-17 cytokine family (IL-17A to IL-17F), has been  demonstrated to paly crucial role in the progress of  atherosclerosis [9–16]. The expression of IL-17A was  increased in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)  and IS [12, 17, 18]. High concentration of IL-17A in  at hero sclerotic plaques can promote the development of  at hero sclerotic lesions [15], while blockade of IL-17A  in atherosclerosis mice model resulted in a significant  reduction of at hero sclerotic lesions [9, 16]. Additionally,  by binding to the he ter odi mers receptor, IL-17RA-IL17RC, on different cell types, IL-17A can stimulate the  secretion of a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such  as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor $\cdot\upalpha$   (TNF $\cdot\mathfrak{a}$  ), and   $\mathrm{IL}\!-\!1\upbeta$  [19–21], and leukocyte-mobilizing cytokines, such as the  chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and CXCL8  [22–24]. These cytokines have been previously reported  to play a role in the pathogen es is of IS [17, 25–31]. Taken  together, these findings indicate that IL-17A may be used  as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target for IS.  

IL-17A gene, which is located on chromosome  6p12.23 in human genome, encodes the IL-17A cytokine.  Recently, several polymorphisms in the IL-17A gene  were identified, among them, rs1974226 and rs3748067  polymorphisms in the   $_3\mathrm{,}$  untranslated region (  $_3\cdot$   UTR)  of the IL-17A gene, and rs2275913 polymorphism in  the promoter of the IL-17A gene, which were reported  to be functional in influencing individual’s susceptibility  to a huge numbers of human diseases, such as gastric  cancer [32–35], pulmonary tuberculosis [36], asthma  [37–39], osteoarthritis [40], rheumatoid arthritis [41],  and CAD [42–44]. However, to date, no study has been  reported on the association between polymorphisms  in the IL-17A gene and IS risk. Thus, in our present  study, we investigated the possible association between  three polymorphisms of the IL-17A gene and risk of  IS in a Chinese population. Moreover, serum IL-17A  levels among IS patients and the control group, and the  relationship between these three IL-17A polymorphisms  and IL-17A serum levels were also explored.  

# RESULTS  

# Clinical characteristics of the study population  

The clinical characteristics of the IS group and the  control group are summarized in Table 1. There were no  significantly different between IS patients and the control  group with regard to age and gender   $P=0.329$   and  $P$   $=0.443$  , respectively). Diabetes and hypertension were  more prevalent in IS patients than those of the control  group (all  $P<0.001$  ). Comparing with the control group,  the IS group had significantly higher TG, LDL-C and  TCH levels (all   $P<0.05$  ), but lower HDL-C levels (  $P<$  0.001).  

# Association between IL-17A polymorphisms and  risk of ischemic stroke  

All the three polymorphisms showed three  genotypes according to the sequencing results (Figure 1).  The genotypes distribution of the three polymorphisms  in the control group conformed to HWE (Table 2). As  is shown in the Table 2, we found that the frequency  of rs2275913 G allele in the IS group   $(52.2\%)$   was  significantly higher than those of the control group   $(46.2\%)$   and was associated with significant increased risk  of IS compared with the control group   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.27$  ,   $95\%$    CI,   $1.05{\sim}1.54$  ,  $P=0.014\$  ). Table 3 shows the association  between IL-17A polymorphisms and risk of IS under  genotypes and genetics models analysis. We found that  the rs2275913 GA and GG genotypes were associated  with significant increased risks of IS compared with the  rs2275913 AA genotype between cases and controls,  even after adjusted by age, gender, hypertension, diabetes  mellitus, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TCH (GA vs. AA:  adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=1.72$  ,   $95\%$   CI,   $1.05{\sim}2.81$  ,  $P=0.032$  ; GG  vs. AA: adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}}\,=\,1.99$  ,   $95\%$   CI,   $1.08{\sim}3.67$  ,   $P=$    0.028). Moreover, the significant increased risk was also  observed in model analysis, even after adjusted by age,  gender, hypertension, diabetes, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C,  and TCH (GA/GG vs. AA: adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=1.78$  ,   $95\%$   CI,   $1.11{\sim}2.86$  ,  $P=0.017$  ).  

# Genotype distribution of rs2275913  polymorphism in different population  

In consideration of the important of the rs2275913  polymorphism in the pathogen es is of IS, we further  perform a comparison which shows the genotypes  distribution of the rs2275913 polymorphism in different  populations (Table 4). The results showed that the  genotypes distribution of rs2275913 polymorphism in our  current study were significantly different from HapMapJPT (HM-JPT), HM-LWK, HM-MEX, HM-GIH, HM- YRI, HM-ASW, HM-MKK HM-CEU and HM-TSI  populations   $(P<0.05)$  ). However, no significant different  was found when comparing with HM-HCB, HM-CHB and  HM-CHD populations   $(P>0.05)$  ), (The data of HapMap  population were obtained from the website bellow:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ref. cgi?rs  $=$  2275913).  

# Haplotype analysis of rs1974226, rs3748067 and  rs2275913 polymorphisms and risk of ischemic  stroke  

Haplotype analysis was performed and the possible  7 haplotypes are listed in Table 5. We found that the  rs1974226 polymorphism was in linkage d is equilibrium 

 (LD) with the rs3748067 (  $\mathbf{D}^{\circ}=0.89)$  ) and the rs2275913 

  $(\mathbf{D}^{\prime}~=~0.34)$   polymorphisms. While, the rs3748067  polymorphism was in LD with the rs2275913   $\mathbf{(D'_{\alpha}=}$  0.72) polymorphism. CCA and CCG are the two major  haplotypes in both cases (  $47.0\%$   and  $39.4\%$  , respectively)  and controls (  $49.6\%$   and  $35.9\%$  , respectively). However,  we didn’t find significant association between IL-17A  haplotypes and IS risk.

# Association of rs2275913 polymorphism and  serum IL-17A levels  

Moreover, serum IL-17A levels among cases  and controls, and the association between rs2275913  polymorphism and serum IL-17A levels were examined  (Figure 2). We found that serum IL-17A levels in the  IS group were significantly higher than those of the  control group   $(P<0.01)$  ). In particular, after a systematic  comparison between rs2275913 genotypes and serum IL17A levels, we found that patients carrying the rs2275913  GA or GG genotype present with a higher serum IL17A levels compared with those carrying the rs2275913  AA genotype (both   $P<0.01$  ). However, there were no  significantly different in serum IL-17A levels between  individuals with rs2275913 GA and rs2275913 GG  genotypes   $(P>0.05)$  ).  

# DISCUSSION  

To our knowledge, this is the first research to  assess the association between rs1974226, rs3748067  and rs2275913 polymorphisms and risk of IS. The  results of our research suggested that the rs2275913 G  allele, the rs2275913 GA and GG genotypes, and the  GA/GG vs. AA model were associated with significant  increased risk of IS. More importantly, we found that the  rs2275913 polymorphism was associated with abnormal  IL-17A expression. Patients carrying the rs2275913 GA  or GG genotype present with a higher serum IL17A  levels compared with the rs2275913 AA genotype.  Taken together, these results indicate that the rs2275913  polymorphism may serve as a risk factor for predicting  IS risk.  

The rs2275913 polymorphism is located in the  promoter region of the IL-17A gene. Recently, several  researches have been conducted to assess the possible  association between rs2275913 polymorphism and the  susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases, controversial  results, however, were obtained, even in the same ethnic  group. Geng et al. [42] reported that the rs2275913 AA  genotype and the GG/GA vs. AA model were associated  with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD)  in the Chinese population. However, Shuang et al. [43]  reported that the rs2275913 AA genotype and the GA/ AA vs. GG model, but no the GG/GA vs. AA model were  associated with an increased risk of CAD in the Chinese  population. On the contrary, two other Chinese researchers  [44, 45] and one Mexico researcher [46] have recently  reported that the rs2275913 polymorphism was not  associated with risk of CAD. Until now, no study has been  conducted to access the association between rs2275913  polymorphism and risk of IS. However, in this study, we  found that the G allele, GA and GG genotypes, and the  GA/GG vs. AA model of the rs2275913 polymorphism  were associated with a 1.27, 1.72, 1.99 and 1.78-fold  increased risk of IS, respectively. Moreover, we further  investigated whether the rs2275913 polymorphism will  affect protein expression of the IL-17A gene. We observed  that patients with rs2275913 GA or GG genotype present

with higher serum IL-17A levels. The results we obtained  is similar to a recent case-control study conducted by Li  et al. [47], in which they found that the rs2275913 GG  genotype was associated with significantly increased  IL-17A levels. In brief, these findings suggest that the  rs2275913 GA and GG genotypes are risk factors for IS,  probably through up regulation the protein expression of  IL-17A gene.  

With regard to the rs3748067 polymorphism and  risk of cardiovascular diseases, controversial results  were also observed. Zheng et al. [44] reported that the  rs3748067 CC genotype and the CT/CC vs. TT model  of the rs3748067 polymorphism were associated with  increased risk of CAD. However, data from case-control  studies of Su et al. [45] and Shuang et al. [43] suggested  that there were no significantly association between  rs3748067 polymorphism and CAD risk. Our present  date in agree with the negative result, we didn’t find any  association between rs3748067 polymorphism and IS risk.  

To date, although association studies between  rs1974226 polymorphism and risk of cardiovascular  diseases have not been carried out, three independent  studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship  between rs1974226 polymorphism and risk of human  diseases. Korytina et al. [48] reported that rs1974226  polymorphism was associated with a 2.31-fold increased

[49] reported that rs1974226 AA genotype and GG/GA  vs. AA model were associated with a 2.56 and 2.60-fold  increased risk of gastric cancer in the Chinese population,  respectively. Additionally, Nakada et al. [50] reported that

the rs1974226 GG genotype was associated with a 2.19- fold increased risk of Gram-positive infection compared  with GA/AA genotype, and the rs1974226 G allele was  associated with a 1.44 and 1.67-fold increased 28 day  mortality in St Paul’s Hospital and Vasopressin and Septic  Shock Trial cohorts, respectively. However, we didn’t find  any association between rs1974226 polymorphism and IS  risk in the Chinese population in our present study.  

Several possibilities should be taken into account to  explain the controversial between IL-17A polymorphisms  and susceptibility to different types of human diseases.  

As for the inconsistent between IL-17A polymorphisms  and risk of different human diseases in diverse cohorts  of population, it has been well accepted that genetic  polymorphisms usually have distinct effect in different  types of human diseases, especially in diverse ethnic  groups. This phenomenon, such as, can be seen in previous  study of genetic association of CD40 gene rs1883832  polymorphism and susceptibility to different types of  human cardiovascular diseases, in which association studies  of the rs1883832 polymorphism and CAD supported the  viewpoint that the rs1883832 CT and CC genotypes were  associated with increased risk of CAD [51, 52], however, on  the contrary, studies on the association between rs1883832  and IS have demonstrated that the rs1883832 CT and TT  genotypes were associated with increased risk of IS [53,  54]. As is shown in the Table 4, we found that the genotype  distribution of rs2275913 polymorphism was significantly  different from HM-JPT, HM-LWK, HM-MEX, HM-GIH,  HM-YRI, HM-ASW, HM-MKK HM-CEU and HM-TSI  populations, but were no significantly different when  comparing with three other Chinese population (HM-HCB,  HM-CHB, and HM-CHD). As for the controversial between  IL-17A po 1 y morphism s and risk of the same disease, a  relative small sample size and the possible selection bias  may be potential problems.  

IL-17A, produced mainly by activated Th17 cells,  can induce the secretion of a variety of stroke-related  cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL1 and CXCL8  [19–24]. The IL-17A levels were significantly increased in  serums, cells surface, and at hero sclerotic plaques of patients  with CAD and IS [12, 17, 18]. Atherosclerosis is known  as a major cause of IS. Enhanced Th17-cells were found  to associate with at hero sclerotic lesion formation in IL18 deficient apo lipoprotein E-knockout fed high-fat diet  mice [15]. While, blockade of IL-17A in apo lipoprotein  E-knockout mice can reduce at hero sclerotic lesion  development, decreases plaque vulnerability, cellular  infiltration, and tissue activation [9, 16]. Given the crucial  role of IL-17A in IS pathogen es is, the positive results of our  present study were biologically reasonable.  

Although the results of our present study are  promising, several limitations remain to be consideration.  Firstly, the relatively small sample size of the present  study may result in insufficient statistical power to detect  the relationship between IL-17A polymorphisms and IS  risk. Secondly, because our research was designed as a  hospital based study, we cannot rule out the possibility of  selection bias, and the results we got may not be a good  representative of general public. Finally, the subjects of  our study are all Chinese, and the results we obtained may  not be able to directly expand to other ethnic group.  

In conclusion, in this study, we report for the first  time that the rs2275913 polymorphism in the promoter of  IL-17A gene was associated with a significantly increased  risk of IS, probably by up regulating the expression of IL17A cytokine. Further investigations with a larger sample  size, especially in different ethnic groups are needed to  confirm our results.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Study population  

This case-control study was approved by the ethical  committee of Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical  University for Nationalities. Informed consents were  obtained from all the participants. The case group include  392 IS patients who were consecutively recruited from the  department of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang  Medical University for Nationalities from January 2013  to September 2016. There were 256 male and 136 female  patients with a mean age of   $61.8\pm10.1$   years in the IS  group. All the IS patients were diagnosed on the basis  of clinical symptoms and cranial computed tomography  and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Patients with  hemorrhagic, car dio geni c, tumorous, and drugs induced  stroke, and those whom with chronic inflammatory and  autoimmune diseases were excluded from this study.  Moreover, 443 age and gender matched controls who  came to the same hospital for routine medical checkup  during the same period were recruited. Individuals with  cerebro vascular diseases, hereditary diseases, liver  diseases, tumors, and in form a tory or autoimmune diseases  were excluded from this study. There were 278 male and  165 female with a mean age of   $60.7\pm10.3$   years in the  control group. Clinical information such as age, gender,  diabetes, hypertension, triglyceride (TG), low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C) and fasting serum levels of total  cholesterol (TCH) were obtained from medical record  review of our hospital. All participants were unrelated Han  Chinese from the same geographic region.  

# DNA isolation and genotyping  

Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood  by using a commercial extraction kit (QIANGEN, China).  Genotyping methods have been described in our previous  work [55]. Briefly, the genotypes of the rs1974226,  rs3748067 and rs2275913 polymorphisms were detected  by Snapshot SNP genotyping assay. Genotyping results  were analyzed by using Gene Mapper 4.1 (Applied  Biosystems). The results were read by two independent  research assistants with a blindness of cases and controls.  Furthermore, DNA sequencing method was used to  confirm our results, and the results were  $100\%$   concordant.  

# Serum IL-17A determination  

Serum samples from IS patients and the control  subjects were separated from venous blood at room  temperature and stored at   $-50~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   until use. Serum IL-17A  levels of the IS patients and the control subjects were  analyzed by an ELISA kits (e Bioscience, Austria) strictly  in accordance with the protocol of the manufacturer.  Developed color reaction was read by a microplate reader  (RT-6000, China). The concentration of serum IL-17A was  computed by using standard curve constructed with the  kit’s standards over the range of  $0{\mathrm{-}}200\;{\mathrm{pg}}/{\mathrm{m}}1$  .  

# Statistical analysis  

All statistical analyses were carried out by using  SPSS statistical software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago,  IL, USA; version 17.0). Clinical data such as age, TG,  LDL-C, HDL-C and TCH are continuous variables and  were displayed as mean± SD. If these data were normally  distributed, Student’s    $t\cdot$  -test was used, and otherwise, ranksum test was used. Other data such as gender, diabetes and  hypertension are categorical variables and were expressed  as proportions. The comparison of these data chi-squared  test were used. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was  calculated by chi-squared test. The association between  the three polymorphisms and risk of IS were calculated  by logistic regression and were evaluated by odds ratio  (OR) and  $95\%$   confidence interval (CI). ORs and  $P$   values  of the three polymorphisms were adjusted based on age,  gender, hypertension, diabetes, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, and  TCH. Haplotype analysis was performed by online SHEsis  software [56]. A  $P$   value less than 0.05 was considered as  statistical significant.
