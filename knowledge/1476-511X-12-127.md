# Abstract  

Background:  Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels predict cardiovascular events incidence in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Genetic variants in the rs3798220, rs10455872 and rs6415084 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Lp(a) gene ( LPA ) correlate with elevated Lp(a) levels, but whether these SNPs have prognostic value for CAD patients is unknown. The present study evaluated the association of  LPA  SNPs with incidence of subsequent cardiovascular events in CAD patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).  

Methods:  TaqMan SNP genotyping assays were performed to detect the rs6415084, rs3798220 and rs10455872 genotypes in 517 Chinese Han patients with CAD after PCI. We later assessed whether there was an association of these SNPs with incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and coronary re vascular iz ation). Serum lipid profiles were also determined using biochemical methods.  

Results:  Only the rs6415084 variant allele was associated with higher Lp(a) levels [41.3 (20.8, 74.6) vs. 18.6 (10.3, 40.9)  $\upgamma\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{d}$  ,  $\mathsf{p}<0.001]$  . During a 2-year follow-up period, 102 patients suffered MACE, and Cox regression analysis demonstrated that elevated  $\mathsf{L}\mathsf{p}(\mathsf{a})$     $(\geq\!30\ \mathsf{m g}/\mathsf{d l})$  ) levels correlated with increased MACE (adjusted HR,   $1.69;$     $95\%$   CI 1.13-2.53), but there was no association between  LPA  genetic variants (rs6415084 and rs3798220) and MACE incidence   $(\mathsf{p}>0.05)$  ).  

Conclusions:  Our data did not support a relationship between genetic  LPA  variants (rs6415084 and rs3798220) and subsequent cardiovascular events after PCI in Chinese Han CAD patients.

# Introduction  

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In past decades, multiple cardio vascular disease risk factors have been identified and used for risk stratification and outcome evaluations; lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is one of the most attractive and promising risk factors.  

Lp(a) is a plasma lipoprotein consisting of a cholesterolrich low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle with one apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) molecule and an additional apo lipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) protein attached via a disulfide bond [1]. Previous studies demonstrated that elevated Lp (a) levels are associated with increasing incidence and severity of cardiovascular diseases [2-7]. Furthermore, elevated baseline Lp(a) levels predict the subsequent cardiovascular event incidence in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) after percutaneous coronary intervention

 (PCI) [8-10].  

Serum Lp(a) levels are largely affected by Lp(a) gene

 ( LPA ) variations, which varies widely across different races [11-13]. Recently, many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in  LPA  [11,12,14-16]. Among these polymorphisms, rs3798220 and rs10455872 are two common  LPA  variants that have been studied intensively. Rs3798220 and rs10455872 are short variations in the   $5'$   haplotype block of  LPA,  which is located at the 6q27 chromosomal region. Both of these variations are strongly associated with serum Lp(a) levels in Caucasians, and each rs10455872 (G;   $7.0\%$   frequency) and rs3798220

 (C;   $2.0\%$   frequency) minor allele increased log Lp(a) by

 1.18 and 1.27 standard deviation units [17], respectively. A series of case – control studies demonstrated that rs10455872 and rs3798220 are significantly associated with CAD and myocardial infarction risk and are also associated with at hero sclerotic burden, obstructed coronary artery number and an earlier CAD diagnosis [17-19]. However, whether these two  LPA  SNPs correlate to subsequent cardiovascular event risk for CAD patients after PCI is unknown. The present study was therefore aimed to explore the association between the two aforementioned SNPs in addition to another  LPA SNP rs6415084, which is also a short variation in the   $5'$  haplotype block of  $L P A$   and correlates with Lp(a) levels [12], and the incidence of subsequent cardiovascular events in Chinese Han patients with CAD after PCI.  

# Methods  

# Study population  

In total, five hundred and seventeen Chinese Han patients from Guangdong General Hospital were sequentially enrolled during May 2009 and August 2010. All of the patients were between 18 and 80 years old, unrelated Han Chinese male and female CAD patients. All of the patients received PCI before discharge. We excluded patients for any of the following: contra indication to aspirin or clop i dog rel therapy, pre-existing bleeding disorders, pregnancy, lactating or planning to become pregnant, advanced cancer, hemodialysis and unsuccessful genotyping. This study has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTROCH-11001198). All of the participants provided written informed consent for genetic analysis. The Guangdong general hospital ethics committee approved the study.  

# Genotyping  

Genomic DNA was extracted from  $4\ \mathrm{~ml~}$  EDTAanti coagulated blood with the PureGene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minnesota, USA) according to the manufacturer ’ s recommendations. Rs6415084 rs3798220 and rs10455872 of  LPA  were determined for each patient using the TaqMan genotype discrimination assay (Applied Biosystems, California, USA) following the manufacturer ’ s instructions.  

# Lipid profile determination  

Serum lipid profiles including total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apo lipoprotein A (apoA), apo lipoprotein B (apoB) and Lp(a) were determined by biochemical methods on the second day of each patients ’  admission. Lp(a) was measured in serum samples using sandwich enzyme-linked immuno s or bent assays (ELISA) [Lp(a) ELISA kit, Yaji Biosystems, Shanghai, China] and a SYNCHRON LX20 UniCel DxC800 analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc., USA); less than   $30\;\mathrm{\meg/d l}$   was considered within the normal range.  

# Data collection clinical follow-up  

Baseline risk factors, coronary ang io graphic findings and medication use were recorded for all of the enrolled patients. Follow-up information was collected based on inpatient and outpatient hospital visits as well as telephone contacts with the patients or their families 6, 12, 18, 24 months after PCI. The clinical end point was the cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke (CT or MR scan confirmed) and coronary re vascular iz ation. Coronary re vascular iz ation included PCI (including a there c to my, balloon angioplasty and stenting) or coronary artery bypass grafting in the follow-up period. For subjects with multiple events, only the first event was considered for analysis.  

# Data analysis  

Categorical data are reported as frequencies, and differences between groups were compared with the    $\upchi^{2}$    test. Fisher exact tests were used when the expected cell frequencies were less than 5. Continuous data are reported

as the mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range, quartile1-quartile3) for continuous variables, and differences between groups were assessed using a ttest or Mann – Whitney U rank-sum test according to distribution status. All of the SNPs were assessed for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg d is equilibrium with the use of a  $\upchi^{2}$    test. If the minor SNP genotype frequency was less than   $5\%$  , the minor genotype was combined with the intermediate genotype.  

Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan – Meier method and compared using the Log-rank test; univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression was used to find associations with baseline clinical character istics and 2-year incidence of MACE. Variables with p values  $<0.10$   were entered into the multivariable model, and variables with p values  $<0.10$   remained in the model. Because the rs6415084 minor genotype (TT) frequency was less than  $5\%$   and only two rs3798220 and rs10455872 genotypes were detected in our subjects, a dominant effect model of Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of separate SNP to the incidence of MACE and corresponding   $95\%$   confidence interval (CI). The wild-type genotype (W)/W was coded as 0, and the W/variant (V) and V/V genotypes combined were coded as 1. The significance level for all of the statistical tests was   $\mathrm{P}<0.05$  . Data analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 (Statistical Product and Service Solutions, Chicago, Illinois, USA).  

# Results  

# LPA  SNP genotype and allele frequency distribution  

The  LPA  SNP genotype and allele frequency distribution are demonstrated in Table 1. Of the three SNPs studied, both rs6415084 and rs3798220 were prevalent in our cohort except rs10455872, for which the variant allele was present in only two patients (G). The variant rs6415014 (T), rs3798220 (C) and rs10455872 (G) allele frequencies were 0.113, 0.081 and 0.002, respectively. There were no significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between patients with or without MACE (all   $\mathsf{p}>0.05,$  ).  

# The effect of  LPA  SNPs on serum Lp(a) levels in Chinese Han CAD patients  

Patients with the CT/TT genotype had a significantly higher Lp(a) levels compared with those that have the rs6415084 CC genotype [41.3 (20.8, 74.6) vs. 18.6 (10.3, 40.9)   $\mathrm{mg/dl}_{x}$  ,   $\mathsf{p}<0.001]$  . However, there were no significant differences in Lp(a) levels between patients with CC and CG genotype of rs3798220 [23.2 (11.3, 51.9) vs. 18.6 (9.9,46.0) mg/dl,   $\mathsf{p}=0.411]$   (Table 2).  

# Baseline characteristics and their effect on MACE  

A total of 517 patients made up our study cohort. During a 2-year follow-up, 102 patients   $(19.7\%)$   suffered at least one incidence of MACE (  $\cdot12.0\%$   coronary revascu lari z ation,   $3.9\%$   cardiac death,   $1.7\%$   non-fatal myocardial infarction,   $1.9\%$   ischemic stroke). The baseline characteristics of patients with or without MACE are described in Table 3. Multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated that systolic blood pressure (adjusted HR, 1.02;   $95\%$   CI: 1.01-1.03), LVEF (adjusted HR, 0.97;

# Discussion  

In our study, we genotyped three  LPA  SNPs and evaluated the association of these SNPs with Lp(a) levels in Chinese Han CAD patients. We found that only the rs6415084 variant correlated to Lp(a) levels; we further explored the association of the two SNPs that were most prevalent in our cohort (rs6415084 and rs3798220) and found no association between these SNPs and subsequent cardiovascular event incidence after PCI.  

Serum Lp(a) levels are, to a large extent, genetically determined by  LPA  variations in many populations [11,12], and genetic  LPA  variations have been linked directly with CVD risk [5,7]. Notably, certain genetic  LPA variants, such as SNPs rs3798220 and rs10455872, are strongly associated with both increased Lp(a) levels and CAD risk in Caucasians [17]. However, because of race differences, the genotype frequencies may vary across different races [11,12,17]. As an example, the rs10455872 variant is prevalent and significantly associated with elevated Lp(a) levels in Caucasians; however, the variant allele frequency (G allele) of this SNP is very low   $(<\!1\%)$   in Chinese people without CAD [12]. We also found a similar low frequency of this SNP variant allele in our study cohort with CAD. The rs3798220 minor allele (G allele) frequency in the Chinese is relatively higher than the Caucasians   $(8.1\%$   vs.   $1.4\%$  ); however, this variation was not

associated with elevated Lp(a) levels in Chinese Han CAD patients. The reason for the lack of association is uncertain and may be partially explained by allele frequency differences or apo(a) size heterogeneity, which is the result of a genetically determined functional copy number variation within  LPA  [20], but these hypotheses must be tested in further studies. In our study, rs6415084 was the only SNP that was associated with serum Lp(a) levels, which is consistent with a population-based study [12]. Interestingly, the rs6415084 variant allele frequency in our study was 0.11, which was similar to that of Chinese people without CAD in a SHARE cohort [12,21]. These data suggest that this SNP may not play an important role in CAD pathogen es is, but this hypothesis must be assessed in further studies.  

Accumulating evidence has suggested that Lp(a) plays an important role in promoting cardiovascular disease. Elevated Lp(a) levels   $({\geq}30\ \mathrm{mg/dl})$   reportedly predict subsequent cardiovascular event incidence in Caucasians with stable coronary disease, especially in patients with suboptimal LDL-C control   $({\geq}70\ \mathrm{\meg/d l})$   [10]. Recently, Zhou et al. [9] determined that Lp(a) levels at admission are an independent risk factor for subsequent adverse cardiovascular events in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome, especially in patients younger than 60 years old. In our study, we found a similar association between elevated Lp(a) levels   $({\geq}30\ \mathrm{\meg/d l})$   and subsequent adverse cardiovascular events in CAD patients after PCI; elevated Lp(a) levels were associated with 1.77-fold greater likelihood of MACE. Our data and others support the notion that Lp(a) may be used for risk stratification and outcome evaluations.  

Although  LPA  SNP variants correlated with elevated Lp(a) levels [12,17], which were associated with high MACE incidence for CAD patients after PCI, there was no direct association between  LPA  SNP variants and MACE incidence.  LPA  variants rs3798220 and rs10455872 have been strongly associated with both increased Lp(a) levels and increased CAD risk [17]. However, because of racial differences, the rs3798220 and rs10455872 variant allele frequency in our cohort was different from the frequency in Caucasians. Both of these SNPs had no significant effect on serum Lp(a) levels in our cohort; therefore, one would not expect that they would have an effect on MACE incidence. Although the rs6415084 variant was strongly associated with higher Lp(a) levels, we did not discover a direct association between rs6415084 polymorphisms and MACE incidence during a 2-year follow-up. Our result is similar to a study by Nicholls et al., who determined that  LPA  SNPs rs2048327, rs3127599, rs7767084 and rs10755578 as well as haplotypes correlated to plasma Lp(a) levels, and Lp(a) levels    ${\geq}30\ \mathrm{mg/dl}$   were associated with MACE in stable CAD patients during a 3-year follow-up; however, this group did not observe any association of the  LPA  SNPs/haplotypes with increased prospective MACE risk.  

CAD is a multi-factorial disease, and multiple genetic variations combined with environmental factors may result in phenotypic variability; therefore, factors that cause cardiovascular events in CAD are complicated. Compared to risk factors such as Lp(a) levels, disease severity, therapeutic reactions and therapeutic adherence are more effective measures for predicting CAD prognosis. In our study, elevated Lp(a) levels were an independent MACE predictor; however, elevated Lp(a) levels were a result of each Lp(a) genetic variant but not any specific SNP. Of the SNPs, rs3798220 explained approximately   $8\%$   of total (both genetic and individual-specific) variation in   $\mathrm{{L}p(a)}$  levels, and rs10455872 explained approximately   $25\%$   of the variation. Together these two SNPs explained  $36\%$   of the variation in Lp(a) levels in Caucasians [17]; however, in our study, rs6415084 explained only approximately   $4\%$  of total variation in Lp(a) levels (data not shown). Thus, it was not surprising that there was no significant association between the rs6415084 variant and MACE incidence. To date, our data and others do not support use of Lp(a) genetic variants for CAD risk stratification and outcome evaluations. However, because only three  LPA  SNPs were genotyped, and a relatively small patient sample size was involved in present study, further studies with more LPA  SNPs and larger patient sample sizes will be required to confirm this conclusion.  

# Conclusions  

Taken together with previous and present studies, our data did not support a relationship between genetic  LPA variants rs6415084, rs3798220 and subsequent cardiovascular event incidence after PCI in Chinese Han CAD patients; however, other studies will be required to confirm these findings.
