The association between 3 well known SNPs – miR-146a C/G (rs2910164), miR-196a2 T/C (rs11614913), and  miR-499 A/G (rs3746444) – in pre-miRNA sequences and ischemic stroke (IS) are still conflicting and inconclu­ sive. This meta-analysis aimed to pool previous studies get a more precise assessment of the association be­ tween these 3 SNPs and the risk of IS.  

# Background:  

Relevant studies were searched in online databases. The strength of the association between the SNPs and  IS were estimated by pooling odds ratios (OR) and  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CI) using Review Manager (ver­ sion 5.3).  

# Material/Methods:  

Rs2910164 C allele was associated with lower IS risk. But this trend was only observed in Koreans under the  allele model   $(0\mathsf{R}\!\!=\!\!0.81$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C l e}_{}{}^{}$  ,  $\mathsf{p{=}}0.009.$  ), dominant model   $(0\tt R\mathrm{=}0.68$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}\!\!=\!\!0.50\!\!-\!\!0.93$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.02.$  ),  recessive model (  $(0\mathsf{R}{=}0.79$  ,  $95\%$   $\%\subset\mid=0.63-1.00$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.05$  ), and homozygous model (  $\scriptstyle{0\R=0.63}$  ,  $95\%{\sf C I=}0.45{-}0.88$  ,   $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.007]\$  ). Rs11614913 T allele might be associated with higher IS risk under the dominant model   $(0\mathbb{R}{=}1.45$  ,   $95\%\mathsf{C l}{=}1.19\mathsf{-}1.78$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.0003.$  ), while rs3746444 A allele might be associated with decreased IS risk under the  homozygous model   $\!\!\leftrightsquigarrow\!\!\left.08\!\!\rightleftharpoons\!\!0.48$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}\!\!=\!\!0.23\!\!-\!\!0.98$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.04\!\!.$  ) only in Chinese, but not in Koreans.

# Background  

Stroke causes about  $11\%$   of all death across the world and  is the most common cause of adult-acquired disability [1].  Ischemic stroke (IS) and intra cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) con­ stitute about  $80–85\%$   and  $15{\cdot}20\%$   of all stroke cases, respec­ tively [1]. IS is a highly complex disease caused by multiple  genetic and environmental risk factors [2]. Several susceptible  genes associated with increased risk of IS have been recog­ nized, such as ACE, F5, MTHFR, and APOE [3]. But these find­ ings only revealed a part of the inherited risk of IS. It is nec­ essary to further study the genetic background and disease  susceptibility genes to better understand this disease.  

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small (\~22-nucleotide)  and conserved endogenous non-coding RNA. They can bind to  the  $_3,$  -untranslated region   $_{3},$  -UTR) of target mRNAs, thereby  regulating gene expression through translational repression  or mRNA degradation [4]. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) were the most frequent variation in the human genome.  SNPs or mutations in mature miRNAs may affect the matura­ tion process or target selection, thus influencing the down­ stream physiological processes [5,6]. Three well-known SNPs  in pre-miRNA sequences – miR-146a C/G (rs2910164), miR196a2 T/C (rs11614913), and miR-499 A/G (rs3746444) – have  been widely studied and were associated with the risk of sev­ eral diseases [7,8]. In fact, miR-146a is closely related to reg­ ulation of tumor necrosis factor $\cdot\upalpha$   (TNFa ) [9]. MiR-146a were  significantly down regulated in patients with IS in the acute  phase but up regulated in the subacute phase [10], exerting a  neuro protective effect through astrocytes [11]. MiR-196a2 can  target annexin A1 [12]. MiR-499 can affect the inflammato­ ry reaction through modulating C-reactive protein (CRP) [13].  Therefore, these 3 miRNAs may play important roles in reg­ ulating thrombosis or inflammation pathways in the circula­ tion system. Considering the important role of the SNPs in the  expression or targeting of the miRNAs, several recent studies  tried to explore the influence of the SNPs on IS risk [14–17].  However, the results were conflicting and inconclusive. The  present meta-analysis aimed to pool previous studies to get  a more precise assessment of the association between the 3  SNPs and the risk of IS.  

# Material and Methods  

# Searching strategy  

Relevant studies published before 1 June 2015 were system­ atically searched by 2 authors independently in the databas­ es, including PubMed, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge  Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biomedical Literature  Database (CBLM) by using the following searching terms:  

“ischemic stroke (IS)” and (“single nucleotide polymorphism”  or “polymorphism” or “mutation” or “variant” or “SNP”) and  (“microRNA” or “miRNA” or “miR”). No language restriction  was applied for searching. Reference list of studies included  and other relevant meta-analyses or reviews were manually  searched to find other potentially qualified studies.  

Studies meeting the following criteria were included in this me­ ta-analysis: (1) Case-control design; (2) Studies assessed the  association between SNP of miRNAs and the risk of IS; (3) the  genotype distribution of the controls agreed with the HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE); (4) Detailed data of genotype fre­ quency could be extracted from original studies. Repeat stud­ ies and studies without detailed data were excluded.  

# Data extraction  

Two authors independently extracted data from the original  studies. The information extracted included surname of the first  author, year of publication, country, ethnicity, disease, numbers  of subjects, age, sex, source of controls, genotyping methods,  genotype frequency of case and control, and p value of HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls. Disagreement was  resolved by referring to original studies in group discussion.  

# Quality assessment of studies included  

The quality of included studies was assessed using the mod­ ified Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies  in Epidemiology (STROBE) quality score system. This system  has 40 assessment items to assess a trial’s quality by giving  scores from 0 to 40. Based on the scoring, the quality is de­ fined as low quality (0–19), moderate quality (20–29), or high  quality (30–40).  

# Statistical analysis  

Cochrane Review Manager (version 5.3, Cochrane Collaboration,  Copenhagen, Denmark) was used for data integration and anal­ ysis. The  $\chi^{2}$   test was used to evaluate the HWE of the control  group. The strength of the association between the SNPs and  IS were estimated by pooling odds ratios (OR) and  $95\%$   con­ fidence intervals (CI) under 5 genetic models, including allele  model, homozygote model, heterozygote model, dominant mod­ el, and recessive model. Statistical heterogeneity among studies  was assessed using the chi square-based Q test and I 2  [12].  $\chi^{2}$    tests  $\mathsf{p}\!\ll\!0.1$   or  $|^{2}\!>\!50\%$   indicates significant heterogeneity [12].  If there was significant heterogeneity among the studies, the  random-effects model (the Der Simoni an and Laird method)  was used to make estimates, otherwise the fixed-effects mod­ el (Mantel-Haenszel method) was used. Since only 5 original  studies were involved, there was no need to assess the pub­ lication bias. The statistical significance of the pooled OR was

determined by Z test and  $\mathsf{p}\!\!\times\!\!0.05$   was considered as a signif­ icant difference.  

# Results  

# Characteristics of studies included  

A total of 8 studies were found through searching in the data­ bases. Among them, 2 were excluded for irrelevance and 1 me­ ta-analysis was excluded. Finally, 5 studies meeting the crite­ ria were included [14–18], among which 2254 cases and 2506  controls were included. The flow chart summarizing the search  process is shown in Figure 1 and the basic information of the  included studies is given in Table 1. Among the 5 studies, 5  assessed the association between miR-146a (rs2910164) and  IS risks, 4 assessed miR-196a2 (rs11614913), and 3 assessed  miR-499 (rs3746444). The genotype distribution of rs2910164,  rs11614913, and rs3746444 is presented in Table 2. All of the  studies had genotype distribution in controls in agreement  with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) expectation.  

# Results of meta-analysis  

The results of meta-analysis for the association between the  3 SNPs (rs2910164, rs11614913, and rs3746444) and the IS  risks are shown in Table 3.  

# MiR-146a rs2910164 C/G and the risk of IS  

There was no significant association between this SNP and  the IS risk under all genetic models. When performing a sub­ group analysis by country, a similar trend was observed in the  Chinese population. However, significant associations were  observed in the Korean population under the allele mod­ el   $(0\mathsf{R}\!\!=\!\!0.81$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C I}\!\!=\!\!0.68\!\cdot\!\!0.95$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.009$  ), dominant mod­ el (  $\mathord{\leftrightsquigarrow}0\mathord{\mathsf{R}}\!=\!0.68$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}\!\!=\!\!0.50\!\!-\!\!0.93$  ,   $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.02$  ), recessive model   $\mathsf{\Gamma}_{0\mathsf{R}=0.79}$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}\!=\!0.63\!-\!1.00$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.05$  ), and homozygous mod­ el (  $(0\tt R=\tt0.63$  ,  $95\%{\sf C}|\!=\!0.45\!\cdot\!0.88$  8,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.007$  ) (Table 3), suggesting  there might be some protective effect of the C allele in Koreans.  

# MiR-196a2 rs11614913 T/C and the risk of IS  

For rs11614913, a significant association between T allele and  increased IS risk was observed under the dominant model   $(0\mathbb{R}{=}1.35$  ,  $95\%$   $,\mathsf{C l e}\!=\!1.15\!-\!1.59$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.0003$  ), but not under other  models. Subgroup analysis showed this association was only  significant in Chinese (  $\mathsf{\Gamma}_{0\mathsf{R}=1.45}$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C l e}_{}\!=\!1.19\!-\!1.78$  ,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.0003\!$  ),  but not in Koreans (Table 3).  

# MiR-499 rs3746444 A/G and the risk of IS  

For rs3746444, there was no significant association between  this SNP and the IS risk under all genetic models, but sub­ group analysis showed homozygote AA was associated with  decreased IS risk under the homozygous model (  $\!\!\leftrightsquigarrow\!\!\left.08\!\!\rightleftharpoons\!\!0.48$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathsf{C l e}_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}\!\!=\!\!0.23\!\!-\!\!0.98$  ,  $\mathsf{p{=}0.04}$  ) (Table 3) in Chinese.  

# Discussion  

In this study, we found that, although the 3 SNPs might be as­ sociated with IS, the association varied significantly in differ­ ent countries. rs2910164 C allele was associated with lower  IS risk, but this trend was only observed in Koreans under the  allele model, dominant model, recessive model, and homozy­ gous model. rs11614913 T allele might be associated with high­ er IS risk under the dominant model   $\mathord{\leftrightsquigarrow}\mathsf{O R}\!=\!1.45$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C l e}\!=\!1.19\!-$  1.78,  $\mathsf{p}\!\!=\!\!0.0003.$  ), while rs3746444 A allele might be associated  with decreased IS risk under the homozygous model   $(0\mathbb{R}{=}0.48$  ,   $95\%\,\mathsf{C l}\!=\!0.23\!-\!0.98,\mathsf{p\!=\!}0.04\!,$  ) only in Chinese. These results sug­ gest that the effect of the SNPs might be significantly related  to genetic background of a population.  

Some recent studies found some miRNAs are dys regulated  in IS. For example, miR-497 can directly bind to the 3’UTR of  B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-w mRNAs, whose proteins  play an important role in attenuating stroke-induced apoptotic  cell death [19]. MiR-29b expression was significantly increased  in rat brains by focal ischemia. It can also directly bind to the   $\mathsf{B c l{-2}\ m R N A}$   and thereby promote neuronal cell death [20].  The miR-146a/rs2910164, miR-196a2/rs11614913, and miR499/rs3746444 were all in the 3p strand of mature miRNA re­ gions. The G allele of rs2910164 and T allele of rs11614913  are associated with decreased mature miRNA levels [21,22].  This might help to explain why these 2 alleles were associat­ ed with increased risk of IS in Koreans and Chinese. In fact,  miR-146a can regulate the expression of TNFa  and also in­ hibit the pro-inflammatory MAP kinase pathway and NFk B  pathway [23], which are closely related to occurrence of IS. A

recent study found stroke acutely activates the Toll-like receptor  (TLR) signaling pathway in cerebral vas cula ture. Up regulation  of miR-146a contributes to neuro protection, partly through in­ activation of the TLR signaling pathway [24]. MiR-196a2 can  regulate annexin A1, which has significant repressing effects  on both neutrophil and monocyte migration and adhesion in  atherosclerosis. Annexin A1, as an important endogenous an­ ti-inflammatory mediator, can also repress the expression and  activation of inflammatory enzymes, such as inducible cycloox ­ ygenase 2 (COX2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and  ph os ph o lipase A2 [25]. Therefore, through regulating annex­ in A1, miR-196a2 might exert some effect in IS. MiR-499 can

regulate CRP, a protein closely related to cerebral ischemia.  In addition, mi-499 can also regulate cell apoptosis and cell  death in anoxia and ischemia conditions by targeting calcineu­ rin and dynamin-related protein-1 [26]. Since rs3746444 A/G  mutation might affect binding of targeting mRNAs and matu­ ration of pre-miRNA, it is possible that this SNP might signif­ icantly affect downstream biological functions.  

This study also has several limitations. Firstly, due to the lim­ ited number of original studies, the number of patients in­ cluded was relatively small. After a comprehensive literature  search, only 5 eligible studies were included. Secondly, the in­ formation on clinic o pathological characteristics or disease sub­ types was poorly provided in original studies, making it diffi­ cult to perform more subgroup meta-analysis. Thirdly, IS is a  disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.  The gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may sig­ nificantly affect function of a single SNP. Therefore, the exact

effect of the SNPs may vary in different populations with dif­ ferent genetic backgrounds. In addition, a SNP might be in  linkage d is equilibrium with other genetic variations of stroke  susceptibility genes, which may present stronger effect when  considered together with other variations. These hypotheses  need to be tested in future studies.  

# Conclusions  

The current meta-analysis suggests that rs2910164 C allele  might be associated with lower IS risk in Koreans. rs11614913  T allele might be associated with higher IS risk under the domi­ nant model, while rs3746444 A allele might be associated with  decreased IS risk under the homozygous model in Chinese.  However, these findings should be further verified in studies  with large sample sizes.
