# Abstract  

Family history of hypertension, smoking, diabetes and alcohol consumption and  at hero sclerotic plaque were identified as common risk factors in IS. We aimed at  investigating the relationship between Thymi dy late Synthase (TS) gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke (IS).This case–control research selected and genotyped three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)of TS( rs699517, rs2790, and  rs 151264360) with Sanger sequencing in Chinese Han population. We also adopted  logistic regression analysis in genetic models for calculating odds ratios and   $95\%$    confidence intervals. Genotype-Tissue Expression(GTEx) database analyzed the  tissue-specific expression and TS polymorphisms. The ischemic stroke patients  showed higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total homo cyst eine (tHcy).  It was found that patients with the TT genotype of rs699517 and GG genotype of  rs2790 had larger degrees of tHcy than those with  $\scriptstyle\mathrm{CC}+\mathrm{CT}$   genotypes and  $\mathrm{\AA+AC}$    genotypes, respectively. The genotype distribution of the three SNPs did not deviate  from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Haplotype analysis showed that T-G-del  was the major haplotype in IS, and C-A-ins was the major haplotype in controls.  GTEx database indicated that the rs699517 and rs2790 increased the expression of  TS in healthy human and associated with TS expression level in a single tissue. In  conclusion :  This study has shown that TS rs699517 and rs2790 were significantly  related to ischemic stroke patients.

# Introduction  

Cerebral stroke, also known as cerebro vascular accident, is a complex neurological disorder and the second leading cause of death worldwide (Katan and Luft  2018 ), with the features such as high level of morbidity, disability rate, mortality  rate, recurrence rate, and a lot of complications, bringing serious harm to human  health (Gorelick  2019 ). Stroke is an acute cerebro vascular disease including hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke (Khaku and Tadi  2023 ), which result from  the sudden vascular rupture in the brain or the vascular occlusion preventing  blood flow to the brain, causing damage to brain tissue (Paul and Candelario-Jalil  2021 ). In China, stroke has become the first cause of death and the leading cause  of adult disability (Xu et al.  2021 ). Ischemic stroke(IS) accounts for about   $70\%$   of  stroke cases, and its incidence varies widely geographically with higher incidence  in the northern China than in southern China (Wu et al.  2013 ).  

There are a lot of risk factors for stroke, such as age, race, diabetes, gender, hypertension, obesity, atherosclerosis, and dys lipid emi a (Bhat et  al.  2008 ;  Khoury et al.  2013 ; Klein dor fer et al.  2010 ; Tirschwell et al.  2004 ). In addition,  genetic factors are considered to be significant for stroke (Boehme et al.  2017 ). It  has been identified that polymorphisms of some genes are related to the growth  of stroke, such as DIAPH1 (Ren et al.  2020 ), ABO (Ling et al.  2016 ), MTHFR  (Chauhan and Debette  2016 ), Kalirin (Li et al.  2017 ), and Lp-PLA2 G994T (Ni  et al.  2017 ).  

Ischemic stroke is a disease caused by multiple genes and factors, such as  environmental, dietary habits and genetic factors (Liu et  al.  2021 ). Stroke prevention follows the strategy of tertiary prevention (Manosalva et al.  2018 ). Identification of genetic variants which related to ischemic stroke risk could clearly  illustrate the pathogen es is of stroke and provide a approach to prevent and treat  this complicated disease. Folic acid metabolism plays an indirect or direct role in  the function, division, and differentiation of cells (Hiraoka and Kagawa  2017 ).  Insufficient or excessive folic acid will impair he mato poi es is, impact cell cycle  progression and accelerate DNA damage (Henry et al.  2017 ). The reductases con- trolling the metabolism of folic acid and homo cyst eine are MTHFR, MTR, CBS,  TS and so on (Hiraoka and Kagawa  2017 ; Moulik et al.  2017 ). The normal action  of various enzymes is directly related to the normal operation of folic acid and  homo cyst eine metabolism (Hiraoka and Kagawa  2017 ).  

Thymidyate Synthase (TS) is an enzyme which involved in folic acid metabolism (Liu et al.  2016 ). To be specific, TS, the key enzyme in de novo synthesis  of de oxy thymine monophosphate s (dTMP), catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to dTMP, a nucleotide necessary for DNA synthesis and recovery as a substrate (Hiraoka and Kagawa  2017 ; Kawakami et al.  1999 ; Choi and Mason  2000 ; Zhou et al.  2012 ). Hence, abnormality in the genes  that encode these components can result in various issues such as MTHFR reduction and TS protein increase, even lead to vascular disease by accumulating  tHcy, folate deficiency or both (Ahn et al.  2018 ; Choi et al.  2016 ). The MTHFR  (677)   $\mathrm{C}\!>\!\mathrm{T}$   gene polymorphism also affects circulating tHcy levels and plays an  important role in predicting the risk of ischemic stroke (Huang et al.  2022 ).TS  genetic variants have been reported in cancer therapeutics because of the participation of TS in DNA repair mechanisms (Ahn et al.  2018 ; Jeon et al.  2021 ;  Silva et al.  2020 ; Han et al.  2018 ; Donner et al.  2019 ), then we supposed that  the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TS is associated with the attack  of stroke closely. Jung Oh Kim’s study displayed that TS was associated with  Hypertensive, Diabetic, tHcy and Folate susceptibility to stroke, and TS polymorphism are related to ischemic stroke in the Korean population Kim et al.  2021 .  

In Chinese Han population, the relationship between TS genetic variants and  ischemic stroke susceptibility is still unclear. This study aimed to confirm the relationships between ischemic stroke and TS gene polymorphisms in the northern Han  Chinese population, providing available data for preventing and managing ischemic  stroke.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Study Subjects  

All patients were from the Liaocheng People’s Hospital, including 259 ischemic  stroke patients and 240 control members. All patients were informed of the purpose  of sample collection and signed the written informed consent. The inclusive criteria:  the patients who suffering from ischemic stroke from firstly diagnosed depending on  clinical features and neuro imaging criteria. Anterior circulation stroke is the inclusion standards of patients. Besides, the exclusive criteria: brain injuries, cerebral  tumors, not stroke for the first diagnosis, autoimmune diseases, os teo arth ros is and  psychological illness. Control subjects without history of stroke or cerebro vascular  diseases were selected from health check-up center of our hospital and received a  physical examination. Several healthy controls suffered from vascular risk factors  including diabetes, hypertension, drinking, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia. The  color Doppler ultra sonography (Model: Philips EPIQ7C) was made to investigate  the carotid artery (Abreu et al.  2015 ). The ethics was approved from Committee of  Liaocheng People’s Hospital (ethical code: 2,020,016). All tests were conducted  under the guidance of the Declaration of Helsinki (Snaedal  2014 ).  

# Single‑Nucleotide Polymorphism Selection and Genotyping  

Detailed data for TS SNPs (rs699517, rs2790, and rs 151264360) were acquired  from the dbSNP database ( http://​www.​ncbi.​nlm.​nih.​gov/​SNP/ ). The minor allele frequency of these SNPs was   $5\%$   greater than in Chinese Han population (Dong et al.  2021 ). The blood genomic DNA purification kit (GoldMag) was used to extract the  genomic DNA of peripheral blood samples in all subjects according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Detected by NanoDrop 2000C spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), the purity and concentration of genomic DNA were kept at −   $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   before  further analysis. The Agena Bioscience Assay Design Suite V2.0 software was  adopted to design primers for PCR amplification. Primer information was listed in  Table  1 . Sanger sequencing was adopted to identify SNPs genotyping.  

# Bioinformatics Data Analysis  

We selected GTEx database (Version 8) ( https://​gtexp​ortal.​org/​home/)​to  analyze the  tissue-specific expression and TS polymorphisms (Expression and (GTEx),  2013 ;  Stanfill and Cao  2021 ).  

# Statistical Analysis  

Student’s t-test was adopted to analyze the diversities of demographic features in  case and control individuals for constant variables. Pearson’s   $\chi2$   tests were used for  classified variables. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to test Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) for each genotype. The relationships between TS SNPs  and ischemic stroke risk were assessed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) applying logistic regression analysis. The SHEsis analysis  platform was adopted to make the linkage d is equilibrium index (D-prime and   $\mathrm{r}^{2}$  )  with the deductive haplotypes of these three SNPs. SPSS v24.0 (SPSS) was adopted  to calculate all statistical analyses, and a two-tailed   $P\!<\!0.05$   indicated a statistically  significant difference.

and 240 control members. The general clinical data were displayed in Table  2 .  No obvious significance was found in body mass index, mean age, high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol, serum total cholesterol or overall triglyceride degrees  between the patients and controls. According to the risk factor profile, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, alcohol consumption, family history and atherosclerotic plaque were ordinary risk factors among the patients. The ischemic stroke  patients showed higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and tHcy.  

# TS SNPs and Ischemic Stroke Risk Assessment  

The genotype distribution of the three TS SNPs (rs699517, rs2790, and  rs 151264360) did not deviate from HWE   $\mathrm{P}$   value. The correlation results of TS  SNPs genotype and allele frequency in patients with ischemic stroke and control group are shown in Table   3 . No great diversities were shown in the TS  rs 151264360 genotypes or allele allocation between ischemic stroke patients and  controls   $(P\ \mathrm{all}\!>\!0.05)$  . On the contrary, the distributions of rs699517 genotypes 

 (TT vs CC   $\mathrm{AOR}\,{=}\,3.128$  ,   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}\!=\!1.724\!-\!5.677$  ; CT vs CC   $\mathrm{AOR}\,{=}\,1.933,95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}\,{=}\,1.080{-}3.462$  ;   $\mathrm{CT+TT}$   vs CC   $\mathrm{AOR}\,{=}\,2.404$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,{=}\,1.378{-}4.195;$  allele   $\mathrm{T}$   vs   $\mathrm{C\AOR}\,{=}\,1.684$  ,   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}\!=\!1.298\!-\!2.185$  ) and rs2790 genotypes (GG  vs AA   $\mathrm{AOR}\,{=}\,3.997$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!2.009\!-\!7.953$  ; AG vs AA   $\mathrm{AOR}\,{=}\,1.831$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}\,{=}\,1.259{-}2.664$  ;   $\mathrm{AC}+\mathrm{GG}$   vs AA   $\mathrm{AOR}\,{=}\,2.076$  ,   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}\,{=}\,1.448{-}2.977$  ; allele  G vs A:   $\mathrm{AOR}\,{=}\,1.424$  ,   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}\,{=}\,1.091{-}1.859)$  ) were greatly different between  ischemic patients and control members.

# Haplotype Analysis  

LD measurement and haplotype analysis were made by SHEsis. These three SNPs  were in linkage d is equilibrium (Fig.  1 ). Of 8 possible haplotypes, only 4 had frequencies of  $\dot{>}0.03$   were included in our haplotype analysis (Table  4 ). It was found  that T-G-del was the major haplotype in IS, and C-A-ins was the major haplotype in  controls   $(40.0\%$   and   $42.5\%$  ). Besides, it was found that the T-G-del haplotype may  be related to an increasing risk of IS   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.832$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!1.401\!-\!2.395)$  ), while the  C-A-ins haplotype may be associated with a decreasing risk of IS.

# Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis  

Logistic regression analysis was adopted to analyze IS risk factors in Table   5 .  The risk factors contained hypertension (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!3.982$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!1.915\!-\!8.282)$  ,  diabetes   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!4.250$  ;   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}\!=\!1.595\!-\!11.324)$  , smoking   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!2.462$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!1.240\!-\!4.885)$  , alcohol consumption (  $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!3.057$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!1.487\!\!-\!\!6.284)$  ),  family history   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!3.855$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!1.446\!-\!10.274)$  , at hero sclerotic plaque   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.946$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!1.013\!-\!3.741)$  , LDL-C   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!3.129$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!1.802\!-\!5.435\!$  )  and tHcy   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!1.441$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!1.347\!-\!1.543)$  . Nevertheless, after being corrected  through comparison, TG and HDL-C showed no statistical significance (Table  2 ).  Therefore, further studies need to determine our outcomes in larger sample size.  

# Association Between TS rs699517, rs2790 and Serum tHcy Levels  

The relationship between serum degrees of tHcy and IS was explored. The tHcy  degrees among IS patients were greatly increased compared with the controls  (Fig.   2 A). Even logistic regression was adopted for ordinary risks, including the  hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, family history and atherosclerotic plaque, tHcy levels were still associated with a growing risk of IS (Table  5 ).  It was found that patients with the TT genotype of rs699517 and GG genotype of  rs2790 had larger degrees of tHcy than those with  $\scriptstyle\mathrm{CC}+\mathrm{CT}$   genotypes and  $\mathrm{\AA+AC}$    genotypes, respectively (Fig.  2 B, D). However, individuals with the TT genotype of  rs699517 and GG genotype of rs2790 in the control group showed no great diversity

The levels of tHcy showed no significant differences among different genotype in controls (C, E).  

# Bioinformatics Data Analysis  

GTEx researched autopsy samples from healthy human donors. Genotype and allele  frequencies distribution of rs699517 and rs2790 in control and IS patients (Fig.  3 AD). The TT genotype of rs699517 and GG genotype of rs2790 increased the expression of TS in healthy human (Fig.   3 E, F). The expressed quantitative trait locus  (eQTL) indicated that the TS rs699517 and rs2790 were associated with TS expression level in a single tissue (Fig.  4 ).  

# Discussion  

This research examined potential relationships between three SNPs of the TS and  ischemic stroke in Chinese Han population. It was observed that rs699517 and  rs2790 were related to IS. The T allele of rs699517 and G allele of rs2790 were  risk factors for IS. However, the rs 151264360 genotypes or allele distributions have  no great diversities between ischemic stroke patients and controls. This is the first  research to show that these SNPs were related to the attack of ischemic stroke in  Chinese population.  

Relationships between the occurrence of IS and folate-associated genes have  been recognized in numerous research (Fekih-Mrissa et  al.  2013 ; Holmes et  al.  2011 ). Most previous research indicated that MTHFR (677)   $\mathrm{C}\!>\!\mathrm{T}$   was related to an  increasing risk of stroke (Qin et al.  2020 ; Chang et al.  2019 ; Kim et al.  2013 ). TS  was located on chromosome 18p11.32 and was mutated in various types of diseases  (Kim et al.  2021 ; Gusella and Padrini  2007 ). TS is the most important protein taking part in tHcy and folate metabolism, and its polymorphism may exert a significant effect on the disease susceptibility of everybody (Ho et al.  2013 ). One of the  most commonly researched polymorphisms is in the the   $3^{\prime}$  -untranslated region   $(3^{\prime})$  - UTR) of TS mRNA, associated with a lessening of mRNA stability and translation,  which lead to the low expression of protein (Ulrich et al.  2000 ). The TS   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR  polymorphic allele (del) doubled the risk of cyto logical abnormalities, possibly due  to TS reduction catalyzed by TS enzyme. The activity of this enzyme is reduced by  TS   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR polymorphism, which is critical for cancer development (Ulrich et al.  2000 ; Mandola et al.  2004 ). Hyper homo cyst eine is one of the risk factors for IS,  and insufficient MTHFR activity can lead to elevated plasma tHcy (Kim et al.  2017 ).  

Alteration in folate metabolism can occur because of modified activity/availability of folate pathway enzymes, which relies on the polymorphisms in their

There were significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of rs699517  and rs2790 between two groups. The rs699517 TT genotype and rs2790 GG genotype were associated  with increased levels of TS compared with CC (E) and AA   $\mathrm{(F)}$   respectively.  $^{**}$  ,  $P\!<\!0.01$  

coding genes in turn (Hiraoka and Kagawa  2017 ). These polymorphisms lead to  reducing folate availability in the place of reaction, resulting in hyper homo cysteinaemia through epigenetic impacts including DNA methyl ation, uracil misincorporation and modified purine synthesis (Moulik et al.  2017 ). The toxicity of  antifolic acid drugs used in cancer therapy is also affected by the modification of  genes encoding folic acid pathway protein, that is, the reduction of protein vector,  folic acid vector, and the alteration of enzyme activities such as TS and MTHFR  (Petrone et  al.  2021 ; Song et  al.  2021 ). Nevertheless, the mechanisms regulating TS expression are not clear, and polymorphisms within the TS are seemingly

significant determinants of the level of TS expression (Donner et al.  2019 ). TS  binds to RNA and inhibits the mRNA translation, thereby regulating cell cycle  progression (Choi and Mason  2000 ). Bioinformatics data analysis indicated that  the rs699517 TT genotype and rs2790 GG genotype increased the expression of  TS. Our results suggested that the rs699517 TT genotype and rs2790 GG genotype were related to increasing levels of TS comparing with CC and AA, respectively. Meanwhile, rs699517 TT genotype and rs2790 GG genotype increased the  risk of IS. The GTEx resource has provided insights into the regulatory impact of  genetic variation on gene expression across human tissues. The GTEx database  showed that the rs699517 and rs2790 had differences in TS expression (Fig.  4 ).  We observed that the rs699517 TT genotype frequency and rs2790 GG genotype  frequency in IS were clearly higher than that in control (Fig.  3 A, B). The GTEx  database also showed that subjects carrying the rs699517 TT genotype frequency  and rs2790 GG genotype frequency had higher levels of TS expression (Fig.  3 E,  F). Further mechanism experiments are needed to verify the connection between

these 2 SNPs and TS expression. In a word, the important role of rs699517 and  rs2790 in TS may be considered as a novel target for predicting the risk of IS.  

Luca Zanoli et  al. found that aortic stiffness was increased in patients with  inflammation and dependent on disease duration and white blood cell count  (Zanoli et  al.  2017 ). Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations of folate/ homo cyst eine metabolism can directly modify production of inflammatory  mediators (Hammons et al.  2012 ). This research also examined the association  between tHcy and IS risk. The tHcy serum levels of IS patients were higher significantly than the controls. The high expression of TS can upregulate tHcy levels  and reduce folate degrees, causing stroke occurrence (Ho et al.  2013 ). There is an  inverse correlation between plasma folate concentrations and tHcy levels (Brevik  et al.  2005 ). So rs699517 and rs2790 may accelerate the inflammatory response  of the body and increase the susceptibility to ischemic stroke by affecting the  metabolism of folic acid. Past research illustrated vascular disease among patients  who suffering from greatly increasing plasma tHcy levels (Park et al.  2013 ). It is  believed that tHcy increases thrombotic risk by stimulating endo the li al damage in  blood vascular system (Joachim et al.  2013 ).  

Nevertheless, this research is preliminary because of small sample size, shortage  of measuring TS mRNA and protein expression and simultaneously only evaluated  three SNPs in TS. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a replica ti ve study with a  larger sample size to confirm our findings, including genotyping, expression, and  interpretation. Moreover, the functional mechanisms should be clearly illuminated  for better understanding of the etiology of ischemic stroke.  

# Conclusion  

Our research suggested two polymorphisms in TS, rs699517   $\mathrm{C}\!>\!\mathrm{T}$   and rs2790   $\mathrm{A}\!>\!\mathrm{G}$  , increasing the susceptibility to ischemic stroke in the north of Chinese Han  population. Once the correlation between TS and ischemic stroke is confirmed by  larger cohort of patients, TS SNPs could be potential markers of ischemic stroke,  which would assist to prevent ischemic stroke in Chinese Han individuals.
