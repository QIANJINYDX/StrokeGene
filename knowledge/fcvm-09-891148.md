Med. 9:891148. doi: 10.3389/fcvm.2022.891148 Background:  Observational studies indicated that cholesterol efﬂux capacity (CEC) of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is inversely associated with cardiovascular events, independently of the HDL cholesterol concentration. The aim of the study is to examine the casual relevance of CEC for coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), and compare it with that for ischemic stroke and its subtypes using a Mendelian random iz ation approach.  

Methods:  We performed a 2-sample Mendelian random iz ation to estimate the casual relationship of CEC with the risk of CAD, MI, and ischemic stroke. A CEC-related genetic variant (rs 141622900) and other ﬁve genetic variants were used as the instrumental variables. Association of genetic variants with CAD were estimated in a GWAS involving 60,801 CAD cases and 123,504 controls. They were then compared with the associations of these variants with ischemic stroke and its subtypes (large vessel, small vessel, and card i oem boli c) involving 40,585 ischemic stroke cases and 406,111 controls.  

Results:  Using the SNP of rs 141622900 as the instrument, a 1-SD increase in CEC was associated with   $45\%$   lower risk for CAD (odds ratio [OR] 0.55,   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval [CI]  $0.44{-}0.69$  ,  $p<0.001$  ) and   $33\%$   lower risk for MI (odds ratio [OR] 0.67,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}~0.52–0.87$  ,  $p=0.002,$  ). By contrast, the causal effect of CEC was much weaker for ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] 0.79,   $95\%$   CI 0.64–0.97,  $p=0.02$  ;  $p$   for heterogeneity  $=0.03,$  ) and, in particular, for card i oem boli c stroke   $(\rho$   for heterogeneity  $=0.006)$   when compared with that for CAD. Results using ﬁve genetic variants as the instrument also indicated consistently weaker effects on ischemic stroke than on CAD.  

Conclusion:  Genetic predicted higher CEC may be associated with decreased risk of CAD. However, the casual association of CEC with ischemic stroke and speciﬁc subtypes would need to be validated in further Mendelian random iz ation studies.

# INTRODUCTION  

Epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease ( 1 ); however, recent clinical trials ( 2 ,  3 ) and Mendelian random iz ation (MR) studies ( 4 ,  5 ) failed to established a clear causal association between HDL cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. This led to the hypothesis that the at hero protective role of HDL lies in its function rather than in its concentrations ( 6 ).  

The most important measure of HDL function is cholesterol eﬄux capacity (CEC), the ability of HDL to reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral cells ( 7 ). Previous cohort and casecontrol studies showed that CEC was inversely associated with atherosclerosis and the incidence of cardiovascular events in the general population, independently of the HDL cholesterol concentration ( 8 – 11 ). However, observational epidemiological studies may suﬀer from confounding and selection bias that represent obstacles to valid causal inference ( 12 ,  13 ). The causal association between CEC and cardiovascular diseases is still controversial. Furthermore, ischemic stroke had a heterogeneous mechanism and may have diﬀerent cause and risk factors from coronary artery disease (CAD) ( 14 ). Previous MR studies have showed a weaker eﬀect on ischemic stroke than on CAD for some lipid metabolic factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) variants ( 15 ,  16 ). Therefore, the relative eﬀects of CEC on CAD and ischemic stroke needs further investigation.  

MR study, using genetic variants as instrumental variables, is a method that can control potential con founders and reverse causation that may bias observational studies, and make stronger causal inferences between an exposure and risk of diseases ( 12 ). In the present study, we aimed to use MR analysis to examine the causal relevance of CEC for CAD and myocardial infarction (MI), and compares it with that for ischemic stroke and its subtypes.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Study Design  

A two-sample MR analysis using CEC-related genetic variants as instrumental variable was designed to evaluate the causal eﬀect between CEC and risk of CAD and ischemic stroke

 ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Summary-level data on the exposure

 (CEC) were derived from a recent published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of up to 5,293 European individuals ( 17 ) and data on the outcome (CAD and ischemic stroke) were obtained from GWASs of up to 446,696 European individuals ( 18 ,  19 ).  Table 1  and  Supplementary Table 1  shows the characteristics of these GWASs. Approval of ethics committee and written informed consent were obtained before data collection in the original GWASs.  

# Genetic Instrumental Variables  

We used 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CEC identiﬁed through GWAS by Low-Kam et al. ( 17 ) as the instrumental variables. Low-Kam et al. ( 17 ) tested the genetic association between 4 CEC measures and genotypes at  ${>}9$   million common autosomal DNA sequence variants in 5,293 French Canadians. They identiﬁed 10 genome-wide signiﬁcant signals   $(P<6.25\times10^{-9}$  ) representing 7 loci. Among the 7 loci, 2 loci (near the  PPP1CB/PLB1  and  RBFOX3/ENPP7  genes) only reached genome-wide sign i can ce in the model further adjusted for HDL-C and triglyceride levels which may lead to false positive associations in the GWAS context (i.e., collider bias). Other 5 loci ( CETP ,  LIPC ,  LPL ,  APOA1/C3/A4/A5 , and  APOE/C1/C2/C4 ) harbored genes with important roles in lipid biology and reached genome-wide sign i can ce in the model adjusted for sex, age squared, coronary artery disease status, experimental batches, statin treatment, and the ﬁrst 10 principal components. Except for the  APOE/C1/C2/C4  variant, association of other 4 loci disappeared when correcting for HDL-C and triglyceride levels. Only the SNP of rs 141622900 in  APOE/C1/C2/C4  locus reached genome-wide sign i can ce in both two models and was used as the instrument. In sensitivity analysis, we used the most signiﬁcant SNP in each of the 5 loci (rs77069344, rs2070895, rs247616, rs964184, and rs445925) as the instrument. These 5 SNPs were in diﬀerent genomic regions and not in linkage d is equilibrium (  $(r^{2}<0.1)$  ). The 1 SNP (rs 141622900) instrument explained   $0.9\%$  and the 5 SNPs instrument explained   $5.3\%$   of the variance in CEC (  $\dot{F}$   statistic  $=\,59.2$   and 45.9, respectively, indicating suﬃcient strength of the instruments).  Table 2  shows the characteristics and associations of these included SNPs with CEC.  

# Outcomes  

Summary statistics for the association of each CEC-related SNP with the CAD and MI were extracted from the Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome-wide Replication And Meta-Analysis Plus Coronary Artery Disease Genetics (CARDIoGRAM plus C 4 D) 1000 Genomes-based GWAS ( 17 ). The CARDIoGRAM plus C 4 D 1000 Genomes-based GWAS interrogated 9.4 million variants in up to 60,801 CAD cases and 123,504 controls from 48 studies of predominantly European ancestry. Summary statistics for the association of the included SNPs with ischemic stroke and the 3 main subtypes of ischemic stroke (large artery stroke [LAS], small vessel stroke [SVS], card i oem boli c stroke [CES]) were extracted from the GWAS of Multi ancestry Genome-wide Association Study of Stroke (MEGASTROKE) consortium ( 19 ). The MEGASTROKE consortium tested    ${\sim}8$   million SNPs and indels with minor-allele frequency  ${\geq}0.01$   in up to 67,162 stroke cases and 454,450 controls from 29 studies, predominantly European ancestry (40,585 cases; 406,111 controls). This GWAS involved 34,217 cases with LAS, 5,386 cases with SVS and 7,193 cases with CES of European ancestry. The associations of the 6 individual SNPs for CEC with CAD and MI, and ischemic stroke and its subtypes are presented in  Tables 3 ,  4 , respectively.  

# Statistical Analysis  

Per-allele eﬀects of the selected SNPs on CEC and disease outcomes were extracted from the GWASs and used to estimate the causal eﬀect of CEC on outcomes using two-sample MR analyses. Using the SNP of rs 141622900 as the instrument, Wald ratio method were used to obtain eﬀect estimate by dividing the SNP-outcome estimate by the SNP-CEC estimate. Standard error were estimated using the Delta method by dividing

the SNP-outcome standard error by the SNP-CEC estimate ( 20 ). When using the 5 SNPs as the instruments, we used a conventional inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR analysis with multiplicative random eﬀects assuming all genetic variants are valid instruments. In IVW method, the SNP-outcome estimate is regressed on the SNP-CEC estimate, weighted by the inversevariance of SNP-outcome estimate and with the y-axis intercept is ﬁxed to zero ( 21 ). We further conducted method o logic sensitivity analyses using MR-Egger, simple median, weighted median methods using the 5 SNPs as the instruments, which are more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic or invalid instruments. MREgger method can assess and control for directional pleiotropic bias and provide an pleiotropy-corrected eﬀect estimate in which genetic variants are permitted to be invalid instrumental variables ( 22 ). The median methods can provide a consistent eﬀect estimate using the median of the empirical distribution function of individual SNP ratio estimates in which up to   $50\%$   of the genetic variants are permitted to be invalid instruments ( 23 ). Presences of heterogeneity between causal eﬀects of individual variants and comparisons between the causal eﬀects of CEC on CAD vs. ischemic stroke were tested using the Cochran Q statistic and    $I^{2}$    index in the IVW analysis ( 23 ). Evidence of pleiotropic eﬀects were assessed using intercepts of the MR-Egger regression ( 22 ). Moreover, multivariable two-sample MR were performed to adjust for major causes of survival (smoking, body mass index, and blood pressure) using the 5 SNPs as the instruments ( 24 ). Multivariable MR analysis was used to assess whether the associations between genetic predisposition to CEC and ischemic stroke may be aﬀected by selection bias ( 25 ). The above analysis

# RESULTS  

Genetically determined 1-SD increase in CEC was casually associated with a substantial decrease in risk of CAD   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.55$  ,  $95\%\operatorname{CI};0.44-0.69,p<0.001)$   and MI (  $\mathrm{{CR}}=0.67$  ,  $95\%$   CI:  $0.52\mathrm{-}$  0.87,  $p\,=\,0.002)$  ); but, by contrast, was not causally associated with ischemic stroke   $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.79$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.64–0.97,  $p=0.02)$  ) or any separate subtype of ischemic stroke (LAS:   $\mathrm{{OR}=0.67}$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.39–1.17,    $p=0.16$  ; SVS:   $\mathrm{{OR}=1.08}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.71– 1.63,  $p=0.73$  ; CES:  $\mathrm{OR}=0.72$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.44–1.17,  $p=0.18)$   at the Bonferroni-adjusted level of sign i can ce   $(p<0.0083)$  ) using the SNP of rs 141622900 as the instrument ( Figure 1 ). The eﬀect of CEC on ischemic stroke was weaker than that on CAD   $(p$  for heterogeneity  $=0.03$  ,  $I^{2}=80\%$  ), and in particular on CES (  $\cdot p$   for heterogeneity  $=0.006$  ,  $I^{2}=87\%$  ), whereas the eﬀects of CEC on LAS and SVS were compatible with the magnitude of the eﬀect observed for CAD (  $\cdot p$   for heterogeneity  $=\,0.53$   and 0.34, respectively). The eﬀects of CEC on ischemic stroke and its subtypes were compatible with the magnitude of the eﬀect for MI (  $\cdot p$   for heterogeneity  $=0.34$  , 1.00, 0.80, and 0.06, respectively). These analyses had a    ${>}99$  ,    ${>}99$  , 70, and   $82\%$   power to detect a   $30\%$   decrease in risk of ischemic stroke, LAS, SVS, and CES (equivalent to the upper limit of the CI for CAD), respectively; this can exclude a causal eﬀect of CEC on ischemic stroke and CES of the same magnitude as on CAD, and indicate comparable eﬀects of CEC on LAS, SVS, and CAD. Whereas, the power to detect a  $13\%$   decrease in risk of ischemic stroke, LAS, SVS, and CES (equivalent to the upper limit of the CI for MI) was 72, 65, 16, and   $20\%$  , respectively; this indicated comparatively little power for comparable eﬀects of CEC on ischemic stroke, particular stroke subtypes and MI.  

Similar disparate associations of CEC were observed with the risk of CAD (  $(\mathrm{OR}=0.85$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.79–0.90,  $p<0.001)$  ) and MI (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.86$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 0.80–0.92,  $p<0.001\rangle$  ), compared to ischemic stroke   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.02$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.95–1.09,  $p=0.58_{,}$  ) and its subtypes (LAS:   $\mathrm{OR}=0.90$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.76–1.07,  $p=0.25$  ; SVS:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.00$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.85–1.17,  $p=0.95$  ; CES:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.04$  ,  $95\%$   CI:  $0.91{-}1.19$  ,  $p=0.60,$  ), using the IVW methods with the 5-SNPs instrument ( Figure 1 ). The eﬀect of CEC on ischemic stroke was weaker than that on CAD (  $\cdot p$   for heterogeneity    ${<}0.001$  ,  $I^{2}=93\%$  ) and MI (p for heterogeneity    ${<}0.001$  ,    $I^{2}=91\%$  ), and in particular on CES

 (  $\acute{p}$   for heterogeneity  $=0.008$  ,    $I^{2}=86\%$  ;   $\mathtt{p}$   for heterogeneity  $=$  0.  $)1,I^{2}=83\%$  ), whereas the eﬀects of CEC on LAS and SVS were compatible with the magnitude of the eﬀect observed for CAD (  $\cdot p$   for heterogeneity  $=0.49$   and 0.07, respectively) and MI (  $\cdot p$   for heterogeneity  $=0.58$   and 0.10, respectively). These analyses had a    ${>}99$  , 99, 42, and   $53\%$   power to detect a   $10\%$   decrease in risk of ischemic stroke, LAS, SVS, and CES (equivalent to the upper limit of the CI for CAD and MI), respectively; this can exclude a causal eﬀect of CEC on ischemic stroke of the same magnitude as on CAD and MI, and indicate comparable eﬀects of CEC on LAS, CAD, and MI.  

Signiﬁcant association for CAD and MI and in sign i cant association for ischemic stroke and its subtypes were also observed in sensitivity analyses using the MR-Egger, simple median and weighted median methods using the 5-SNPs instrument ( Table 5 ). Evidence of heterogeneity was observed for the outcome of CAD and MI   $(Q=42.5,p<0.001$  ;    $Q=35.4,p<$  0.001) but not for the outcome of ischemic stroke or its subtypes

 (  $\dot{Q}=5.3$  ,  $p=0.26$  ;  $Q=6.6$  ,  $p=0.16$  ;    $Q=2.8$  ,  $\protect p=0.59$  ;    $Q=2.0$  ,  $p=0.74)$   in the IVW analysis. MR-Egger regression showed no evidence of directional pleiotropy for the association of CEC with all disease outcomes (all  $\it{\Delta}p$   value for intercept    ${\tt>}0.05$  ) ( Table 5 ). In sensitivity analyses using FinnGen GWAS data, signiﬁcant associations for ischemic heart disease and MI and in sign i cant association for ischemic stroke and CES were observed using the SNP of rs 141622900 as the instrument. However, no signiﬁcant associations for the outcomes was observed in the IVW analysis using the 5-SNPs instrument ( Supplementary Table 2 ). In the multivariable MR adjusting for major causes of survival using the 5-SNPs instrument, the associations of CEC with ischemic stroke and its subtypes remained in sign i cant, which were similar to the estimates by the IVW method ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Similar results of in sign i cant associations for ischemic stroke were observed in the UK Biobank data ( Supplementary Table 4 ).

The present study is the ﬁrst large-scale assessment and comparison of causal relevance of CEC and the risk of vascular

disease using Mendelian random iz ation approach. The results showed that genetic predicted higher CEC may be associated with decreased risk of CAD. However, the casual association of CEC with ischemic stroke and speciﬁc subtypes would need to be validated in further Mendelian random iz ation studies.  

Our ﬁndings of inverse relationship between CEC and CAD and MI are consistent with several meta-analysis summarizing previous observational studies ( 10 ,  26 ,  27 ). Although results from the majority of studies were in line with the hypothesis that higher CEC is associated with lower risk of CAD ( 9 , 11 ,  28 – 31 ), a study by Li showed that increased HDLmediated CEC was paradoxically associated with increased risk for incident myocardial infarction or stroke, which based on the study population undergoing coronary angiography ( 32 ). Moreover, the German Diabetes Dialysis Study (4D Study) failed to observe an signiﬁcant association of CEC with the composite outcome (cardiac death, nonfatal MI, and stroke) in patients with end-stage renal disease ( 33 ). The CEC was quantiﬁed using human THP-1-derived macrophage foam cells loaded with cholesterol, which was diﬀerent from cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate)-stimulated murine J774 macrophages employed by other studies in the general population ( 8 ,  11 ). The reasons for the apparent discrepancies among previous studies in the relationship between CEC and CAD are unclear but could be ascribed to diﬀerence in sample size, study population, study design, and methods for CEC measurements across studies. Considering the heterogeneity between observational studies and potential con founders that warrant caution, MR studies using genetic variants as instrumental variables could provide more robust evidence for the causal relationship of CEC and the health outcome of interest. The present study showed genetic predicted higher CEC was associated with lower CAD risk, which supports the direct causal association between CEC and CAD.  

Our study does not support a causal role of CEC in ischemic stroke. Few studies have investigated the association between CEC and ischemic stroke and its subtypes expect two cohort studies with inconsistent results ( 9 ,  29 ). Results from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort showed no relationship of cholesterol mass eﬄux capacity with stroke or with non-hemorrhagic stroke. However, a small subgroup ( n  $=37.$  ) of the Dallas Heart study reported an inverse association between CEC and stroke. Using genetic variants related to CEC as the instrument, the association between CEC and ischemic stroke was examined directly in our study. However, we found no evidence of signiﬁcant causal relationships between CEC and ischemic stroke and its subtypes. In the present Mendelian random iz ation study, the estimates of CEC with ischemic stroke might be biased by sample selection on surviving exposure of interest and on surviving competing risk of the outcome ( 24 ). However, the results of multivariable MR analyses conducted by adjusting for potential causes of survival were consistent

with the main results. As with any selection bias correction by multivariable adjustment, it may not be feasible to recover the valid estimate. We repeated the analyses in the UK Biobank data and FinnGen data, respectively. Both results were similar to the main results in the present study. Larger scale Mendelian random iz ation studies are still needed to clarify the genetic eﬀects of CEC on ischemic stroke and assess any heterogeneity between ischemic stroke subtypes, which may shed light on the relationship of CEC on ischemic stroke further. Furthermore, in these future studies, the eﬀects of genetically determined CEC on ischemic stroke could be compared between patients with vascular cognitive impairment vs. patients with noncognitive impairment.  

The HDL-mediated CEC is the ability to remove excess cholesterol from lipid-laden macrophages representing the ﬁrst crucial step within the process of reverse cholesterol transport ( 7 ). Reverse cholesterol transport plays an important role in at hero protective mechanism by facilitating the removal of cholesterol in the arterial wall and the subsequent decrease in the pro in amma tory response ( 34 ,  35 ). Our study found that the eﬀect of CEC was weaker on ischemic stroke than CAD, which were consistently observed in such comparisons in the eﬀects of other blood lipid on vascular disease in recent Mendelian studies. A Mendelian study suggested that the eﬀects of LDL cholesterol on ischemic stroke was weaker than that on coronary heart disease ( 16 ). Moreover, another Mendelian study showed PCSK9 genetic variants had smaller associations with risk of ischemic stroke than with risk of coronary heart disease ( 15 ). The potential explanation for the diﬀerence between the eﬀects of CEC on CAD and ischemic stroke is the biological diﬀerences in these disease process. Ischemic stroke involves phenotypic heterogeneity, with diﬀerent biological pathways for LAS, SVS, and CES, compared to the more homogenous CAD phenotype ( 36 ). Moreover, a review reported that hematological disorders were the most frequent etiology of cerebral infarcts of unusual cause ( 37 ). Except for the usual cerebro vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dys lipid emi a, other newly factors could be considered of the causal relevance for ischemic stroke. Furthermore, diﬀerences in the distribution of risk factors as well as patient characteristics between CARDIoGRAM Plus C 4 D and METASTROKE consortium may partly explain the diﬀerent eﬀects for CAD and IS observed in the study. Additionally, insuﬃcient statistical power due to small sample size, especially for stroke subtypes, may be considered as another reason. An ace trap ib, an CETP (cho lester yl ester transfer protein) inhibitor that was developed for increasing HDL cholesterol levels and promoting CEC to a greater degree, was shown a signiﬁcant reduction in CAD in the REVEAL trial ( 38 ). Although it met its primary endpoint, the small improvement against the main goal and the safety of CETP inhibitor had become a point of contention consistently. Finally, An ace trap ib was not ﬁled for approval with the US Food and Drug Administration. Our study provided supporting evidence for the causal relationship between CEC and risk of CAD, indicating potential intervention targets to the increase of CEC for improving cardiovascular outcomes.  

The present Mendelian random iz ation analyses relies on three underlying assumptions. First, we identiﬁed 6 CEC-related SNPs (  $(P\,<\,\dot{6}.25\,\times\,10^{-9})$  ) served as instruments in the MR analysis that satisﬁed the ﬁrst assumption. Second, we did not ﬁnd that the 5-SNPs in the study were associated with other key lipids including low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and apo lipoprotein B based on GWAS datasets. And the results of multivariable MR analyses and sensitivity analyses using the UK Biobank data and FinnGen data were consistent with the main results. Thus, these results increase conﬁdence in the validity of the second assumption that there is no confounding (measured or unmeasured) of the genetic variants with the outcome. Third, all the genetic variants were not directly associated with the outcomes (all    $P\:>\:5\:\times\:10^{-8})$  ), which suggested that the third assumption was not violated.  

Our study has several limitations. First, the study was conducted based on datasets of predominantly European ancestry and generalization of the results to other populations of non-European ancestry was limited. However, the uniformity of the included subjects may minimize the risk of bias by population admixture. Second, the sample sizes of ischemic stroke subtypes were still relatively small, spec i call y for SVS and CES. In sign i cant association between CEC and ischemic stroke subtypes could be attributed to insuﬃcient statistical power. However, most estimates were consistent using diﬀerent MR approaches, which suggests that the observed associations are not by chance. Third, although the GWAS that we used to identify all CEC-related SNPs represents the ﬁrst and largest eﬀort to identify genome-wide signiﬁcant loci associated with CEC, sample size remains modest   $\mathit{\Omega}_{N}=\mathit{\Omega}_{5,293}$   participants), and therefore there is a limitation of power to ﬁnd weak eﬀect variants. In the main analysis, only one SNP (rs 141622900) was used as the instrument. The SNP is strongly associated with many key lipids relevant to cardiovascular disease, such as lowdensity lipoprotein and apo lipoprotein B. The pleiotropic eﬀects of the CEC-related SNPs on other key lipids was unable to be assessed by two-sample multivariable MR in the present study because of the lack of data. However, we have conducted MREgger regression using 5 CEC-related SNPs as the instrumental variables to assess evidence of pleiotropic eﬀects in the study. Though the results showed no evidence of directional pleiotropy, further studies are needed to validate the associations of CEC with disease outcomes. Forth, we performed multivariable MR and sensitivity analyses to correct selection bias. However, recovering the valid estimates of CEC for ischemic stroke has not been fully addressed. Finally, Mendelian random iz ation has been considered as an alternative approach for causal inferences with a lot of advantages compared to randomized controlled trials. However, it cannot replace randomized controlled trials in establishing a claim of causality ( 39 ). Future clinical trials are still needed with suﬃcient statistical power to validate the causal relationship of CEC.  

The study examined causal relationships between CEC and risk of vascular disease using MR analysis, and suggests that genetic predicted higher CEC may be associated with decreased risk of CAD. However, the casual association of CEC with ischemic stroke and speciﬁc subtypes would need to be validated in further Mendelian random iz ation studies.
