# ABSTRACT  

Introduction:  Ischemic stroke at later stages   ${(>}4.5$   hour) have  very few treatment options left. In those cases Nitric Oxide  (NO) may provide promising results. NO is active in signaling  pathways. Sodium Nitro prussi de (SNP), a NO donor was tested  earlier in rat Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) model  in early stages (5-60 minutes) and found useful but in delayed  stroke cases (60-120 minutes) found useless. This was due  to local inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase Enzyme (iNOS) and  superoxide (causes destructive effect) formation which was  skipped.  

Aim:  To evaluate the effect of Intra carotid Sodium Nitro prussi de  (ICSNP) in MCAO rat model of ischemic stroke (I/R model) fifth  post ischemic stroke day.  

Materials and Methods:  A total of 24 Sprague Dawley rats,  weighing   $250\ \mathsf{g m}$   to   $280\ \mathsf{g m}$  , at CDRI-Lucknow, India were  used. Rats were divided in three groups. Group A   $\left(\mathsf{n}\!\!-\!\!4\right)$   were  taken as sham with standard procedure but without any  injection on fifth day, Group B   $\scriptstyle(\mathsf{n}=8)$  ) as control with injection of  saline on fifth day and Group C   $(\mathsf{n}\!\!=\!\!12)$  ) received SNP at dose  of 3 mcg/kg/minute given directly in internal carotid artery via  External Carotid Artery (ECA) with a modified intra lumina l stump  technique as Ischemia/Reperfusion (I/R) in ips i lateral MCAO  at  intra carotid artery region as a single dose therapy on fifth day  and then wound was closed. Waited for full recovery for two  hours, then neuro behavioural assessment scores were noted.  Thereafter, the brains were quickly removed and sliced at   $2\,\mathsf{m m}$    intervals. Animals showing no sign of neurological deficit, were  excluded from the study. Tested animals were compared with  control animals for neurological deficit, percentage of infarction  by 2,3,5-Triphenyl Tetra zo liu m Chloride (TTC) staining, nNOS  expression and scores were summed up. The statistical analysis  was done by Newman–Keuls test, Graph Pad prism (version.5.0)  and  $\mathsf{p}\!<\!0.05$   was considered statistically significant.  

Results:  ICSNP group (Group C) showed a good reduction  in the cerebral infarction of   $53.42\%$   as compared to control  (Group B). Group A mean change in Newman–Keuls test and  Graph Pad prism (version.5.0) was showing increase of 1.44  points  $76.55\%$  , compared to Group B decrease of 0.7 points. A   $60\%$   decrease in ischemic zone noted in Group A.  

Conclusion:  The use of single dose ICSNP is beneficial   $(53.42\%)$    in fifth post stroke day.

# INTRODUCTION  

In Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS), recombinant Tissue Plasminogen  Activator (rTPA) is used within 4.5 hours of onset of stroke. Its  afford ability, availability and time constraint make it of limited use [1].  There is need of universally available, affordable alternative drug which  should be having long time period (fifth post stroke day) of utility with  minimum adverse effect. NO may provide promising results.  

The Neuro Vascular Coupling (NVC) [2,3] is a very complex entity of  blood vessels and neurons. It is achieved via an integrated action  of neurons, glial cells and blood vessels that form a ‘neuro vascular  unit’ [3]. NO is active in the signaling pathway that acts at NVC of  global cerebral vessels and local neural tissue [4] thus important  for auto regulation. Disruption to NVC is a common process that  underlies many brain disease states [3] including ischaemic  stroke. Nitric Oxide Donor (NOD) {Sodium nitro prussi de (SNP)}  by acting on post synaptic nitric oxide synthase [4] (NOS) releases  nitric oxide, which crosses synapse retrograde ly [5], acts on nitric  oxide Receptor [6,7] via heme (the ligand binding site) exhibiting,  the 10,000 fold effect [6,7] (determined by Pico Nano Second  Absorption Spectroscopy (PNSAS) then generates an impulse [8]  especially at penumbra region. This mechanism works in long term  phase too via Long Term Potenti ation (LTP) via cGMP pathway [9]. Locally NO can be provided directly (inhaled) or systemic. Inhaled  NO is neuro protective in the developing brain, with reduction in the  size of ex ci to toxic and ischaemic lesions in rats [10-13].  

Three isoform of NOS exists: endo the li al Nitric Oxide Synthase  (eNOS), neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS), and inducible  Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS). eNOS and nNOS are neuro protective  and iNOS is neurotoxic [14-20]. iNOS (neurotoxic) is expressed  in macrophages, glial cells and tumour cells in response to pro  inflammatory cytokines or endotoxin [20] and unlike eNOS and  nNOS it is not expressed unless induced by cytokines or other  agents. It can produce a large amount (100–1000 times greater) of  NO in relation to eNOS and nNOS, due to its independence from  calcium dependent mechanisms for activation. After induction,  iNOS continuously produces NO until the enzyme is degraded.  iNOS peak concentrations occur around one to two days after the  injury in rats and recent study showed that iNOS is also expressed  in human brain at two to eight days after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) [20]. Two times greater NO level was detected in wild-type versus  iNOS knockout animals [21]. Patients with higher levels went on  to have a worse outcome [20] which proves the version “NO is a  double edged sword”.  

There are studies on synaptic cleft’s superoxide formation [22]. The  serum superoxide dismutase (which neutral is es neural synaptic  cleft’s superoxide after crossing blood brain barrier) tends to  decrease upto five days post stroke and its serum level again comes  to normal after that.  

Having these scientific facts in our mind, we organised a study on  MCAO model of rats with aim to find treatment at later stage of  stroke (on fifth day) by the use of intra carotid artery injection of SNP  ips i lateral to MCAO rat model.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

This prospective study has been done from May 2015 to April 2016  at CSIR-CDRI, Lucknow, India on Sprague Dawley rats.  

A total of 24 rats 250 gm to 280 gm were procured from the  National Laboratory Animal Centre of CSIR-CDRI, Lucknow, India  and experiments were performed after necessary approval of the  Institute Animal Ethical Committee. Rats were allowed free access  to food and water.  

Animal grouping:  Three groups were made for study [Table/Fig-1] 

 1. Sham operated   $\left(\cap=4\right)$  );  

2. MCAO-Group  $\left(\cap=\!8\right)$ );  

3. Sodium Nitro prussi de treated ICSNP-Group   $\scriptstyle(\cap=12)$  .  

Sham group were those in which all surgical procedure was carried  out as in MCAO model except insertion of nylon filament. MCAO  group were those in which all surgical procedure were carried out,  middle cerebral artery was blocked by insertion of filament for two  hours. Saline was given on fifth day of procedure.  

ICSNP group were those in which MCAO surgical procedure  (MCAO model with nylon) was done using Modified Intra lumina l  Technique (MIT). ICSNP was given after fifth day of stroke. Sodium  nitro prussi de was given directly in ECA by stump-technique and  wound closed.  

To get maximum ICSNP treated rats in minimum time the sample  size varied.  

Induction of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R):  Rats were anaesthetized  and focal cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO using modified  intra lumina l technique (Longa EZ et al., 1989) [23]. Upon regaining  light reflex, the animals were returned to cages.  

Neuro behavioural assessment:  The neuro behavioural assessment  was performed after MCAO (two hours post MCAO procedure  before placing the rats to the cages), before and after ICSNP  procedure (to get the exact improvement by ICSNP), according to  method developed by Longa EZ et al. [23]. Upon regaining light

5.0) was used to statistical analysis. The p<0.05 was considered statistically significant)  

reflex (by putting torch light in eyes the pupils should contract),  animals returned to cages. Briefly, the neuro behavioural findings  were scored on five point scale with 10 grading scores: a score  of 0 indicated no neurologic deficit, a score of 1 (failure to extend  opposite forepaw fully) a mild focal neurologic deficit, a score of 2  (contra lateral circling) a moderate focal Neurological Deficit (ND), a  score of 3 (falling to the opposite side to the damage when hanged  on net) a severe focal deficit and rats with a score of 4 did not walk  spontaneously and had a depressed level of consciousness. The  scores of neuro behavioural findings obtained after testing on each  scale were summed up and denoted as neurological deficit  score  (Bederson JB et al., 1986) [24].  

The animals showing no sign of neurological deficit were excluded  from the study.  

Measurement of the cerebral infarct area:  After predetermined  time point of I/R, the brains were quickly removed same day that  is on fifth day post MCAO and after ICSNP injection and sliced into  coronal sections at   $_{2\ \mathsf{r m m}}$   intervals. Each slice was immersed in a   $1.0\%$   solution of 2, 3, 5-TTC for 30 minutes at   $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and then fixed  in   $10\%$   buffered formaldehyde solution. The stained brain slices  were digitally photographed and the infarct area was measured  on posterior surface of each section using Biovis Image Plus  software version 1.5. The percentage infarct area was calculated  by subtracting the outlined white area from ips i lateral area of the  hemisphere of affected side of the brain divided by ips i lateral area  and multiplied by hundred. (Bederson JB et al.,) [24]. Also, nNOS  expression was done to assess the usage of nNOS enzyme by  NO.  

# Statistical analysis  

Mean±SEM was calculated and the statistical analysis was done by  One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Newman–Keuls  test. Graph Pad prism (version.5.0) was used for statistical analysis.  

![](images/82b57fc7b79dbfa77b84fec336b13c41b6b9cec9e9eb1dde9060bcf81d6e6069.jpg)  

The  ${\sf p}{<}0.05$   was considered statistically significant.  

# RESULTS  

The effect of ICSNP on fifth day in ischemic stroke model was  evaluated. ND scoring was analysed on the basis of neuro behavioural  changes categorized into five parameters obtained on a ten point  scale after 24 hour of reperfusion in all experimental groups. The  [Table/Fig-2] shows neurological deficit and reduction in infarct  size. The percentage improvement ND score in control group was   $51.42\%$   while in ICSNP group it was   $59.15\%$  . ND was improved  greater in drug treated group showing beneficial effect of drug  administration [Table/Fig-2].  

The area of infarction due to ischemic insult was assessed by TTC  staining. The TTC unstained area representing infarct was measured  and presented as percentage reduction in infarct area. Control  group produced an infarct size of almost  $62.13\%$   in ips i lateral side of  control rat brain as compared to the contra lateral side. The ICSNP  group showed the cerebral infarction to   $33.19\%$   [Table/Fig-2].

The comparison between the two treatment groups for reduction  of percentage of infarction shows significant changes (significance   $\uprho{<}0.001$   vs sham, and   $\mathsf{p}\!<\!0.001$   vs MCAO after six hours) [Table/ Fig-3,4].  

The expression of nNOS was also done to assess the nNOS usage  by nitric oxide. [Table/Fig-5] shows nNOS expression in focal cerebral  ischemia model. It did not show any significant improvement [Table/ Fig-5]. None of the rats died during this experiment.  

# DISCUSSION  

SNP being a NOD acts as post synapse’s NOS and releases NO  which acts pre synaptic ally and generates the impulse via 10,000  fold effect reduces the infarct size thus improves the Neurological  Deficit (ND), even after fifth post stroke day. This issue is obviously  important for the evaluation of stroke patients reach medical  attention very late (more than 4.5 hour) after the occurrence of  cerebral ischemia in which penumbra is still salvageable.  

SNP is a universally available and affordable NOD drug with minimum  adverse effect. We tested its utility in the later stage of stroke to be  useful from fifth day.  

It was earlier demonstrated that intra carotid administration of the  NO generating agents SNP and 3-morph oli no syd non i mine (SIN-1)  which increases Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) in the ischemic territory  and reduces the size of the infarct resulting from occlusion of the  Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) in the rat in acute cases [25,26]. In  further experiment [27] NOD SIN-1 donor were administered 3, 15,  30, 60 or 120 minutes after MCA occlusion.  

The reduction in infarct size and enhanced recovery of CBF and  EEG amplitude by SIN-1 was seen when SIN-1 was administered  3, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after MCA occlusion   $(\mathsf{p}{<}0.05,$  . However,  administration of SIN-1 two hours after MCA occlusion did not  affect the size of the infarct   $_{(\mathsf{p}>0.05)}$  . Authors concluded that post  treatment with SIN-1 was effective in reducing focal ischemic  damage only if this agent was administered up to 60 minutes after  MCAO.  

The "protective" effect is dose-related and is specific for NO  donors because the NO-independent va so dil at or papaverine  does not reduce the size of the infarct [25]. Infusion of NO donors  does not affect platelet aggregation, assessed ex vivo [25]. These  observations indicate that NO donors protect the ischemic tissue at  risk for stroke by enhancing collateral flow to the ischemic territory  (penumbra) and raise the possibility that these agents could be  used in the treatment of acute cerebral ischemia.  

Studies showed that synaptic cleft’s superoxide formation [22] is  being neutral is ed by the serum superoxide dismutase (after crossing  blood brain barrier) tends to decrease upto five days post stroke  and its serum level again comes to normal after that.  

iNOS (neurotoxic) can produce large amount (100–1000 times  greater) and continuously NO in relation to eNOS and nNOS, due to  its independence from calcium dependent mechanisms for activation  until the enzyme is degraded after induction, peak concentrations  occur around one to two days [21].  

These authors [25-27] have not considered iNOS and superoxide  formations at the synaptic region which have a very important  detrimental effect on synaptic activity by inhibiting the antero grade  neuro transmission upto five days post stroke.  

In our MCAO model we have taken care of iNOS and superoxide  both by just holding the rats for five days safely and then giving  intra carotid SNP. Also, instead of using SIN-1 we have used SNP  as a NOD which shows the Long Term Potenti ation (LTP) effect at  synapse level via 10,000 fold effect thereby reducing the size of  infarct.  

In ischemic stroke, the maximum effect can be obtained by  passing eNOS of various systemic vessels and heart (to avoid  cardiovascular instability - hypotension). So ips i lateral to ischemic  stroke, intra carotid injection was given in appropriate dose. The  NO produced hereby, at the infarct tissue locally, acted promptly  through 10,000 fold effect and LTP, thus impulse generated.  

Control group produced an infarct size of almost  $62.13\%$   in ips i lateral  side of control rat brain as compared to the contra lateral side. The  treatment of rats with SNP showed the cerebral infarction to  $33.19\%$    as compared to the contra lateral side. At six hours post injection  the various significance reading is as below (significance   $\mathsf{p}\!<\!0.001$    vs sham, and   $\mathsf{p}\!<\!0.001$   vs MCAO six hours). It means that infarct  size reduced by   $53.42\%$   as compared to control. The reduction  in infarction area may due to improved NVC due to activation of  beneficial nitric oxide (nNOS and eNOS) locally and blood supply to  penumbra region or via 10,000 fold effect.  

The percentage improvement in ND score in control group was   $51.42\%$   while in ICSNP group it was  $59.15\%$  . The neurological deficit  was improved greatly in drug treated group showing beneficial effect  of drug administration. The nNOS expression was not found to have  any difference between two groups (B and C). The nNOS probably  do not have any role in late stages of stroke in rats or our tests were  not upto the mark to test the smallest change in nNOS expression  or it may be possible in humans due to evolutionary difference in  enzymes than to rats but exact mechanism is still to be evaluated.  

# limitation  

The limitations of this study were the number of rats itself and  not able to evaluate the 10,000 fold effect via PNSAS, and non  availability of the PNSAS at our setup.  

# CONCLUSION  

ICSNP reduces infarction by about  $53.42\%$   and neurological deficit  by   $13.07\%$   in ICSNP-Group as compared to control on fifth post  ischemic stroke day. It is a swift-acting drug in the treatment of  focal stroke acts even after five days when iNOS’s and superoxide’s  functions cease but no effect on nNOS expressions. In view of the  above findings we recommend the use of ICSNP in humans on fifth  post stroke day cases via ips i lateral intra carotid artery in very low  dose as a stat injection with every precaution either direct or via  femoral Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA).
