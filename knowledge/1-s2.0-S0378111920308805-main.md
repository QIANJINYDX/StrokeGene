Objective:  The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between two single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) rs505922 and rs532436 in  ABO  gene and the risk of small artery occlusion stroke (SAO) in southern  Chinese Han population.  Methods:  Our case-control study comprising 121 patients with SAO and 136 controls. All participants were Han  population of southern China. IS sub-type was defined on the basis of the TOAST criteria. SAO was strictly  diagnosed after a systematic physical examination and neuro imaging via MRI. Genotype analysis was conducted  by the snapshot technique.  Results:  The distribution of rs532436 genotype between these two groups showed a statistically significant dif­ ference   $(\mathtt{P}=0.048)$  ) while that of rs505922 genotype showed no significant difference   $(\mathtt{P}=0.572)$  . SNP rs532436  was significantly associated with SAO in over dominant model (GA vs.   $\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A})$   after adjusting for age, hy­ pertension history, diabetes history and cigarette smoking (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=2.03$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.14 – 3.62,  $\mathbf{P}=0.016$  ).  However, under all genetic models, the rs505922 polymorphism failed to show association with SAO.  Conclusion:  The results indicate that rs532436 polymorphism in  ABO  gene may have association with SAO in  southern Chinese Han population.

specific pathogen es is of SAO remains unclear. However, according to  previous studies, considerable evidence suggests that endo the li al  dysfunction plays an important role in path o physiological mechanism of  SVD ( Cuadrado-Godia et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2010 ).  

# 1. Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of death and  disability with a complex etiology involving both genetic and environ­ mental factors ( Moz a ff arian et al., 2015 ). Modified Trial of Org10172 in  Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification classified IS into five  e tio logical sub-types, including small artery occlusion (SAO) stroke  ( Traylor et al., 2017 ). SAO is an important stroke sub-type, accounting  for one quarter of IS, and it is also regarded as a common clinical  manifestations belonging to cerebral small vessel diseases (SVD) ( Adams  et al., 1993 ). Other features of SVD include white matter hyper­ intensities (WMH), cerebral micro bleeds and intra cerebral hemorrhages  (ICH) ( Wardlaw et al., 2013 ). In spite of its high clinical incidence, the  

The  ABO  gene is located at chromosome 9q34.2, through encoding  g lycos yl transfer as es, it transfers different carbohydrates residues to the  H-antigen and subsequently determines the ABO group ( Yamamoto  et al., 1990, 1995 ). These blood group antigens are expressed on the  surface of red blood cells and various tissues, including the endo the li al  cells and platelets ( Franchini and Mannucci, 2014 ). Endo the li al  dysfunction is a typical complex disease process caused by genetic fac­ tors. Whereas, the causative gene factors are greatly unknown. The  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in  ABO  gene, considered as  genetic factors, have been regarded as important risk contributors for  the pathogen es is of IS. These correlation aroused our interest to explore  the association between ABO gene and SVD.  

Previous GWAS in 2013 have detected rs505922 in ABO gene as  genetic vatiants associated with ischemic stroke in a Caucasian popu­ lation ( Williams Frances et al., 2013 ). Malik Rainer et al. also found ABO  rs532436 polymorphism is genome-wide associated with all IS ( Rainer  et al., 2016 ). These two results were observed only in a Caucasian  population and still needed to be examined in other ethnicities. There­ fore, we wanted to investigate this two SNPs(rs505922, rs532436) as­ sociation between ischemic stroke in a Chinese Han population. Two  previous case-control studies recruiting Chinese subjects have showed  that ABO gene polymorphisms were associated with large vessel disease  (LVD) ( Zhang et al., 2017; Ling et al., 2016 ).  

In 2018, researchers conducted a multi-ancestry genome-wide as­ sociation study (GWAS), including 521,612 individuals from Europe,  East Asia, Africa, South Asia, mixed Asia and Latin America, which  proved that  ABO  gene showed association with any ischemic stroke  (AIS) irrespective of sub-type, whereas did not reach genome-wide sig­ nificance for one of the IS sub-types ( Rainer et al., 2018 ). However, this  study included Chinese population coming from both north and south  districts of China, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hongkong and Taiwan. It  has been proved that founder populations can enhance the power to  detect certain common alleles effects on complex disease due to reduced  allelic and locus heterogeneity ( Kristian s son et al., 2008 ). Moreover,  homogeneous populations can minimize statistical artifacts in GWAS  ( Price et al., 2010 ). Here, we conducted a study in an ethnically ho­ mogeneous cohort of cases with SAO and controls drawn from southern  Chinese Han population.  

Taking all these considerations together, to test the finding of these  two Caucasian studies and explore more susceptible loci of SAO in other  ethnic population, we focused on the two SNPs (rs505922, rs532436) of  ABO gene and investigated their association with SAO in southern  Chinese Han population.  

$300~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   blood sample in the instructions of manufacturers. Until geno­ typing was conducted, all extractive genomic DNA samples were strictly  stored in the temperature of   $-80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  . Two SNPs in ABO gene(rs505922  and rs532436) were genotyped by SNaPshot kit, supported by Applied  Biosystems ( Li et al., 2012 ).  ABO  SnapShot genotyping, including primer  sequences for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was showed in  Table 1 .  With an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer, PCR fragments  fluorescent-labeled, were decomposed by capillary electrophoresis.  GeneMapper 4.1 software (Applied Biosystems) was used for produced  data analysis.  

# 2.3. Statistics  

All statistical analysis was produced on SPSS 17.0(IBM Inc., Chicago,  IL, USA). To test for alleles deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  (HWE), a chi-square test was used. A student ’ s  t -test was conducted to  analyze body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol and low density lipo­ protein cholesterol between two groups. When comparing the age, blood  pressure, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose and  hemoglobin A1c levels between cases and controls, we used a Mann-Whitney   $U$    test. The frequencies of gender, cigarette smoking history,  ischemic heart disease history, hypertension history, diabetes history,  hyper lipid emi a history, family history of ischemic stroke, genotypes and  alleles distributions were performed between two groups with a chi-square test. To further estimate the differences in distributions, four  genetic models were adopted basing on the genotype distribution of  each locus: dominant, recessive, additive and over-dominant models.  The genetic association was evaluated with a univariate logistic  regression model. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied  when adjusting for the potential interference factors, such as age, the  history of cigarette smoking, hypertension and diabetes. A Bonferroni  correction was used to perform multiple comparisons between cases and  controls such that   $\tt P<0.025$   was considered as statistically significant.  All tests, except for multiple comparisons, were two-tailed and  $\tt P<0.05$  was considered as statistically significant.

# 2.1. Study population  

A total of 121 SAO stroke patients and 136 unrelated, healthy con­ trols were recruited to this study and all of these participants were Han  Chinese. The individuals enrolled in our study, were out/in-patients  registered from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical Uni­ versity from September 2016 to December 2017. A strict physical ex­ amination and neuro imaging via MRI were performed before the SAO  stroke was diagnosed. SAO stroke sub-type, clarified by the TOAST  criteria ( Traylor et al., 2017 ), was defined as a clinical lacunar syndrome  with infarction   $\leq15~\mathrm{mm}$   in diameter on MRI. The exclusion criteria  were applied as following: stenosis  $>50\%$   in the ips i lateral extra cranial  or intra cranial cerebral arteries; card i oem boli c source of stroke;  sub cortical infarction  $\geq15\;\mathrm{mm}$   in diameter; any other specific cause of  stroke (e.g. lupus anticoagulant and cerebral vasculitis); a history of  neurological disorders or brain injury; severe renal failure, liver failure  or cardiac failure; tumor or severe systemic diseases. The enrollment  criteria for controls are: Chinese Han ethnicity; age-gender matched; no  signs or symptoms associated with neurological impairment; no mod­ erate or severe leuk oara ios is (Fazekas grade   $\geq3.$  ); no history of cere­ bro vascular diseases. The exclusion criterion were the same as those for  SAO patients. The study was carried out in accordance with the Decla­ ration of Helsinki. Patients or their legally authorized representatives  were required to sign informed consent.

The description of clinical characteristics details between cases and  controls are listed in  Table 2 . The two groups were well matched on age  and sex   $\left(\mathrm{P}\,>\,0.05\right)$  ). As expected, conventional vascular diseases risk  factors inferred a higher incidence in cases group, including higher  blood pressure, the history of cigarette smoking, hypertension history,  diabetes history and family history of ischemic stroke.  

# 3.2. Genotype distributions of ABO  

The distribution of rs532436 genotype between SAO cases and  controls showed a significant difference statistically   $\mathbf{\Lambda}(\mathbf{P}\ =\ 0.048)$  ( Table 3 ) . The distribution of rs505922 genotype showed no significant  difference between cases and controls   $(\mathbf{P}=0.572)$  ). There was no devi­ ation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in SNPs rs505922   $(\mathtt{P}=0.866)$  )  and rs532436   $\mathbf{(P=0.123)}$   in the control group.

# 3.3. Association between the ABO SNPs and SAO stroke risk  

Dominant, recessive, additive and over dominant models, were used  to analyze the association between the two SNPs in  ABO  gene and the  SAO risk. Under all genetic models, both rs505922 and rs532436 were  unable to show significant association with SAO (rs505922: dominant  model:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.29$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.78 – 2.12,  ${\bf P}=0.322$  ; recessive model:  $\mathrm{OR}=$  0.98,  $95\%$   CI: 0.46 – 2.11,  $\mathtt{P}=0.961$  ; additive model:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.14$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 

 0.51 – 2.58,   $\mathrm{~P~}=\ 0.750$  ; over dominant model:   $\tt O R\;=\;1.29$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 

 0.79 – 2.11,  $\mathsf{P}=0.313$  ; rs532436: dominant model:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.58$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 

 0.94 – 2.67,  ${\tt P}=0.087$  ; recessive model:  ${\tt O R}=0.36$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 0.07 – 1.84, P   $=0.221$  ; additive model:   $\tt O R=0.44$  ,   $95\%$   CI:   $0.09–2.22$  ,   $\mathsf{P}=0.317$  ;  over dominant model:   $\mathrm{{OR}\;=\;1.86}$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.08 – 3.19,   $\tt P\;=\;0.025$  ;  Table 4 ). After adjusting for age, hypertension history, diabetes history  and cigarette smoking, SNP rs532436 was significantly associated with  SAO in over dominant model (adjusted   ${\tt O R}=2.03\$  ,   $95\%$   CI: 1.14 – 3.62, P 

  $=0.016$  ;  Table 4 ).  

# 4. Discussion  

Our study aimed to investigate the association between the two SNPs 

 (rs505922 and rs532436) in  ABO  gene and stroke patients with small  artery occlusion in southern Chinese Han population. The result showed  that the distribution of rs532436 genotype between SAO cases and  controls showed a statistically significant difference   $(\mathbf{P}=0.048)$  ). We  subsequently found that SNP rs532436 was significantly associated with  SAO in over dominant model (GA vs.  $\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A})$  , after adjusting for age,  hypertension, diabetes history and cigarette smoking (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=$  2.03,   $95\%$   CI: 1.14 – 3.62,   $\mathtt{P}=0.016$  ;  Table 4 ). When compared with  rs532436 GG/AA genotype carriers, the risk of SAO stroke patients  which carried rs532436 GA genotype were increased 2.03 fold. This  correlation may suggest that heterozygous genotype increases the risk  for SAO. However, the distribution of rs505922 genotype showed no  significant difference between cases and controls   $(\mathsf{P}\,=\,0.572)$   and it  failed to show association with SAO stroke under all genetic models in  our study.  

A study demonstrated that rs532436 was genome-wide associated  with all IS and the association with  ABO  was strictly confined to LVD and  card i oem boli c stroke with no signal with SAO, which contradict our  findings ( Rainer et al., 2016 ). One possible explanation for this seeming  paradox may be that the previous study was conducted in individuals of  Caucasian ancestry, the findings may not be consistent with our study in  Chinese. A recent multi-ancestry GWAS including Chinese Han popu­ lation proved that  ABO  gene showed association with any ischemic  stroke (AIS) regardless of sub-type, whereas did not reach genome-wide  significance for one of IS sub-types, including SVD ( Rainer et al., 2018 ).  We suspect this difference may lay in population heterogeneity in people  from different parts of China. Whereas, small sample size of our study  may lead to these differences.  

The  ABO  gene can encode g lycos yl transfer as es, which transfer car­ bohydrates residues to the H-antigen and determines the ABO group  ( Yamamoto et al., 1990, 1995 ) .  Previous GWAS study has proved that  the SNP near/within  ABO  gene were associated with plasma

concentrations of E-selectin ( Qi et al., 2010 ). E-selectin is identified as a  marker of endo the li al dysfunction ( Le euwe nberg et al., 1992; Massimo  et al., 2016 ). Through altering the shedding, clearance or secretion of E-selectin on the endo the li al cells, the  ABO  gene risk alleles up-regulate  the level of E-selectin, which subsequently contributes to vascular  damage ( Huang et al., 2013 ). What ’ s more, the strength of this associ­ ation is largely dependent on race as we discussed previously ( Blann and  Seigneur, 1997 ). Studies have showed that endo the li al dysfunction plays  a significant role in the mechanisms leading to SVD-related brain  changes, including SAO stroke ( Poggesi et al., 2016; Wardlaw et al.,  2013; Knottnerus et al., 2010 ), and serum level of the E-selectin was  closely related to SVD ( Blann et al., 1996 ) .  Our study may suggest the  important correlation between the mechanism of endo the li al dysfunc­ tion and SAO stroke basing on the  ABO  gene variation.  

In addition to genetic factors, SAO stroke also associated with age,  gender, hyper tent ion and diabetes history. More studies are needed to  analyse the interaction of genetic variants and traditional risk factors,  such as drinking, smoking and dietary habits.  

Several limitations existed in our study. First, our study samples was  limited to southern Chinese individuals. More ethnic populations need  to be included. Second, the sample size of our study was relatively small.  Thus, a relatively larger sample of Chinese population and perspective  studies are required for validation. Third, we did not measure E-selectin  levels in peripheral blood, only suggested the possible path oph y sio log­ ical mechanism of SAO stroke. Therefore, more investigations should be  conducted to examine our results. Besides, we lack the functional studies  to make better explanation for our findings.  

# 5. Conclusion  

According to previous studies, this research is the first to demon­ strate an association between the  ABO  genetic polymorphism rs532436  and SAO stroke. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the SNP  rs532436 in  ABO  gene has association with SAO stroke in southern  Chinese Han population. Heterozygous genotype (GA) may increase the  risk of SAO. Meanwhile, the SNP rs505922 have no association with SAO  in this group. Further researches and larger sample size will be needed to  explore the significance of  ABO  gene in the path o physiological mecha­ nism of SAO stroke in the future.
