Background:  Individual genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or single case-specific meta-analyses may not  be sufficient evidence to take action against a specific gene function. Thus, we tried to determine a consensus  association between the   $I L–6$  gene rs1800795 polymorphism and multiple disease risks through an updated  statistical meta-analysis.  

Method:  After systematically searching online databases, we found 149 case-control relevant datasets with a  sample size of 96,153 (cases: 38,291 and controls: 57862) and conducted the meta-analysis using updated sta­ tistical models.  

Results:  The analyses of this comprehensive meta-analysis revealed a significant association between  IL-6  174G/  − C polymorphism and overall disorder risk under all genetic models (C vs G:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.11$  ,  $95\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=1.08–1.13;p$  -  value  $=4.8\mathrm{E}{-}17$  ; CC vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.19$  ,  $95\%\operatorname{CI}=1.13–1.26;p$  -value  $=9.4\mathrm{E}–12$  ; CG vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.10$  ,  $95\%$   CI  = 1.06 – 1.14;  $p$  -value  $=1.1\mathrm{E}{-07}$  ;  $\mathbf{CC}+\mathbf{CG}$   vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.13$  ,  $95\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=1.10{-}1.17;$   $p$  -value  $=1.1\mathrm{E}{-}13$  ; CC vs   $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{G}+$  GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.18$  ,   $95\%~\mathrm{CI}=1.06–1.31$  ;  $p$  -value  $=0.0019)$  ) and   $(\mathrm{OR}>1)$  ) with Asian ethnicity. The subgroup an­ alyses based on the diseases revealed that the polymorphism was highly significantly increasing the risk of  coronary artery disease (CAD) under all genetic models. Likewise, a significant association was observed with  increased risk under three genetic models of inflammatory diseases (C vs G; CC vs GG; and CC vs  $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G})$  , and  rheumatoid arthritis (C vs   $\mathbf{G};$   CG vs GG; and   $\mathbf{CC}\,+\,\mathbf{CG}$   vs GG). Conversely, the  174G/C SNP significantly  − decreased the risk of ischemic stroke under the two genetic models (C vs G; and CG vs GG). However, the other  diseases included in this study showed no significant association with  IL-6  (-174G/C) polymorphism.  

Conclusion:  This meta-analysis provided strong evidence for the association between   $^{I L-6}$    gene rs1800795  polymorphism and multiple disease risks. The   $^{I L-6}$  gene could be a useful prognostic biomarker for CAD, in­ flammatory disease, ischemic stroke, and rheumatoid arthritis.  

# 1. Introduction  

Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) is a protein-coding gene that encodes a cytokine  that functions in immunity and tissue regeneration and triggers a variety  of innate and adaptive immunological reactions ( Tanaka et al., 2014 ).  Clinical targets for numerous infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, and  viral diseases, including new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), have  been found in correlation with  IL-6  ( Harun-Or-Roshid et al., 2021;  

Kerget and Kerget, 2021; Trovato et al., 2021 ). The human  IL-6  gene was  found inthe   ${\tt p}15.3$   region of chromosome 7 ( Sutherland, et al., 1988 ).  The rs1800795 is a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the   $I L–6$  promoter region (G/C at position  174) which influences the levels of  − this crucial cytokine. In the literature review, the rs1800795 SNP is a  globally referred important risk factor for investigating the association  with multiple disorders ( Harun-Or-Roshid et al., 2021; Kerget and Ker­ get, 2021; Trovato et al., 2021; Chai et al., 2022 ).

Fig. 1.  Graphical overview of the previous meta-analyses of   $^{I L-6}$    gene rs1800795 polymorphism, where  ${\tt n1/n2}$   is the sample size of cases/controls.  

Several scholars have hypothesized that this SNP is significantly  linked to several malignancies and other diseases ( Harun-Or-Roshid  et al., 2021; Kerget and Kerget, 2021; Trovato et al., 2021 ). However, a  good number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) investigated  the association of this gene SNP with multiple diseases including acute  pan cr eat it is, bronchial asthma, coronary artery disease (CAD), inflam­ matory diseases, ischemic stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes  (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ( Supplementary Table S1 ) ( Chai et al.,  2022; Rai et al., 2021; Shao, et al., 2022; Salari, et al., 2021; Tabaei  et al., 2020; Lu, et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2013; Cheng, et al., 2021; Li, et al.,  2015; Zhu, 2019; Liu et al., 2021 ). Some of them revealed significant  associations but some were not in the same research question. Thus the  single GWAS result is inconsistent for the specific target. This irregu­ larity of GWAS results may occur due to the diversity of sample size and  ethnicity. To overcome the contradictory results some studies performed  a meta-analysis which gives more accurate and high statistical power  results. Some meta-analyses were published on the association between  rs1800795 SNP and a specific disease including CAD ( Rai et al., 2021;  Salari, et al., 2021; Tabaei et al., 2020; Lu, et al., 2020 ), T1D ( Xu et al.,  2013 ), T2D ( Cheng, et al., 2021 ), bronchial asthma ( Li, et al., 2015 ),  acute pan cr eat it is [AP] ( Zhu, 2019 ), inflammatory diseases [ID] ( Liu  et al., 2021 ), ischemic stroke [IS] ( Chai et al., 2022 ), and rheumatoid  arthritis [RA] ( Shao, et al., 2022 ). However, these meta-analyses were  conducted with a small sample size and investigated the correlation with  a specific disease only. The summary of all previously conducted meta-analyses was shown in  Fig. 1 .  

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between   $-174\mathsf{G}>\mathsf{C}\,I L\cdot6$    (rs1800795) gene polymorphism and multiple disease  risks by conducting an updated and comprehensive meta-analysis.  Specifically, we considered investigating the association of this SNP  with acute pan cr eat it is, bronchial asthma, CAD, inflammatory disease,  ischemic stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, and T1D and T2D accumulation  with all possible single studies. Also, we utilize the updated statistical  method such as the goodness of fit test ( Chen et al., 2015 ) to check the  adequacy of the model used to estimate the pooled effect.  

# 2. Methods and materials  

Literature search strategy:  We searched the literature to select  relevant studies based on PubMed, PMC, Google Scholar, and Web of  science online database and published the literature up to May 2022. We  browsed the database to collect literature according to the keyword  search:  “ r  $s1800795^{\prime\prime}$  , "-174G/C", "-174G/C, disorders", " IL-6 , Acute  pan cr eat it is", " IL-6 , Bronchial asthma", " IL-6 , coronary artery disease",  " IL-6 , Inflammatory diseases", " IL-6 , Ischemic stroke", " IL-6 , Rheumatoid  arthritis", " IL-6 , T1D", " IL-6 , T2D", and "association,  IL-6 , disease". Also  checked the relevant article ’ s bibliography which studied the same  objectives.  

Inclusion  and  exclusion criteria:  To select the study for the meta-  analysis we consider the following main inclusion principles, the study  was (i) case-control designed, and (ii) given genotyping distribution. If  the study does not follow the main inclusion principles then we did not  consider it for this analysis.  

Data extraction:  To extract the data we gathered data on several  factors from the included study, including first author, year of publica­ tion, country, region or ethnicity, disease type, number of cases and  controls, and genotypic frequency for case and control group. The  different ethnic populations were divided into Asian, Caucasian, and  African. The authors independently extracted the data and cross-checked it to reduce the discrepancy ( Supplementary Table S1 ).  

Quality assessment:  All individual studies were investigated using  the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess the quality ( Stang, 2010 ). A  total of Nine quality checking points for the NOS score were generated  through three categories. Whereas, the category of selection, compara­ bility and exposure produced 4, 2, and 3 points, respectively. In this  study, we assessed the NOS score by three different groups and evalu­ ated them as poor (0 – 3), fair (4 – 6) and excellent (7 – 9) quality. 110 in­ dividual studies were found to have excellent quality and 39 studies  have fair quality ( Supplementary Table S2 ).  

Statistical analysis:  To make a consensus decision about the asso­ ciation between the  IL-6  gene polymorphism and multiple disorders risk  more accurately, we performed a statistical meta-analysis on the single  genetic studies as follows. We used the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  (HWE) test to check the accuracy of the included single study. The HWE  test was performed using the Chi-square statistic to test the null hy­ pothesis that the consistency of genotypic ratio under the control pop­ ulation and considered the study was good for meta-analysis if the  $p$  -  value   $\geq0.05$  . To synthesize the effect we used the pooled odds ratio

(OR) ( Pallmann, 2015 ) and the corresponding   $95\%$   confidence interval 

 (CI). The pooled effects were estimated based on the fixed effect (FE) or  random effect (RE) model according to the heterogeneity consideration.  The heterogeneity among the selected individual studies was measured  by using Cochran ’ s Q-statistic ( Pallmann, 2015; Cochran, 1954 ) and its  extended Higgin ’ s and Thompson  $I^{2}$    statistic ( Pallmann, 2015; Higgins  and Thompson, 2002 ). The significant heterogeneity was considered  based on the  $p$  -value of Q-test   $<0.10$   and  $I^{2}$    value  $>50\%$  . The presence  of significant heterogeneity suggested that the RE model is appropriate  for estimating the pooled effect, otherwise the FE model. Then we  checked the adequacy of the FE and RE model by using the goodness of  fit (GoF) test which is suggested by Chen et al ( Chen et al., 2015 ). The  GoF test was conducted by comprising three different normality tests,  those are Anderson-Darling (AD) ( Anderson and Darling, 1954 ),  Cramer-von Mises (CvM) ( J. O. I. and H. Cramer,1930; M. G. K. and R.  Von Mises, 1939 ), and Shapiro-Wilk (SW) ( Shapiro and Wilk, 1965 )  tests. Finally, FE and RE models were used to consider the results of the  GoF test. In the FE model, the pooled ORs were calculated by using  Mantel-Haenszel ( Liu and Agresti, 1996 ) method and for the RE model  inverse variance ( Ravi, 2005 ) method was used. To assess the associa­ tion the datasets were reformed by the five different genetic models,  such as (i) homozygote (CC vs GG), (ii) recessive (CC vs  $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G})$  , (iii)  dominant   $(\mathsf{C C}+\mathsf{C G}$   vs GG), (iv) heterozygote (CG vs GG), and (v) allelic  contrast (C vs G) models. The forest plot graphically depicted the asso­ ciation between SNPs and disease risk. Also, the association was  explored using subgroup analysis based on disease type and ethnicity.  The publication bias was examined qualitatively by funnel plot ( Light  and Pillemer, 1986 ) and quantitatively by using Egger ’ s linear regres­ sion test ( Egger et al., 1997 ) and Begg ’ s test ( Begg and Mazumdar,  1994 ). When the  $p$  -value for the Egger ’ s and Begg ’ s tests was  $>0.05$  , the  absence of publication bias was declared. We have further tested the  sensitivity of meta-analysis results by removing studies that failed the  HWE test. The statistical discussion for conducting this meta-analysis  were as described in ( Harun-Or-Roshid et al., 2021 ). All statistical an­ alyses were carried out using R-software   $\mathrm{(R\times64~3.5.2)}$   and plugged in  the  ’ meta ’  package ( http://meta-analysis-with-r.org/ ).  

False positive report probability (FPRP)  and  power analyses:  To  determine whether associations previously reported were false posi­ tives, a false-positive report probability (FPRP) analysis was conducted.  To identify the significant OR, the prior probability   $\pi^{,}$    was set at 0.01  and the FPRP at 0.2 as the threshold for biological importance ( Zhou,  2018 ). The odds ratio (OR) was set at 1.5 (or   $1/1.5$   for a protective ef­ fect) for calculating the statistical power and FPRP for detecting sig­ nificant biologic effects ( Wacholder et al., 2004 ). The OR value of 1.5 is  considered a plausible value and the FPRP value was less than 0.2  considered a significant biologic effect ( Marcus et al., 2000; Engel, et al.,  2002; He, 2018 ).  

Trial sequential analysis (TSA):  was conducted to check whether  random error increases due to the meta-analysis findings being in type I  error and sparse data analysis. TSA was used to control the risk of type I  error by estimating the required information size (RIS) and adjusting the  threshold for statistical significance. To perform TSA for estimating RIS,  TSA software (version 0.9.5.10 Beta,  https://www.ctu.dk/tsa/ ) was  used and provided the   $95\%$   CIs adjusted for sparse data or repetitive  testing, considering with  $5\%$   risk of a type I error and  $20\%$   of the type II  error (a power of   $80\%$  ). The meta-analysis results were used to set the  proportion of control events and relative risk reduction ( Wetterslev  et al., 2008; Wetterslev et al., 2009 ).

considering inclusion – exclusion criteria and removing duplicate studies  through their abstract and title we got 192 studies with full-text articles.  Then, 49 studies were excluded due to the limitation of incomplete in­ formation in the full-text article. Finally, 143 studies were selected with  149 case-control (case: 38,291 and control: 57862) datasets to carry out  the meta-analysis. The comprehensive study selection procedure was  depicted in  Fig. 2 . A total of 149 datasets were merged: 5 for acute  pan cr eat it is, 8 for bronchial asthma, 64 for coronary artery disease  (CAD), 12 for inflammatory diseases, 14 for ischemic stroke, 14 for  rheumatoid arthritis, 7 for type 1 diabetes (T1D), 21 of type 2 diabetes  (T2D), 3 of other diseases and an ‘Other ’  group was made including  single studies each of acute lung injury, broncho pulmonary dysplasia,  and dys lipid emi a). The ethnicity of the selected datasets compiled 58  Asians, 83 Caucasians, and 8 African. The HWE equilibrium test was  used to examine the genotypic distributions of the control groups in each  study, with 129 studies passing and 20 studies failing. We also included  studies that did not pass the HWE and examined their impact on overall  results. All the included study characteristics are given in  Supplemen­ tary Table S1 .  

Quantitative assessments:  The meta-analysis results revealed a sig­ nificant association between   $-174\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{C}$   polymorphism and overall order risk under all genetic model comparisons (C vs G:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.11$  , 95% 

  ${\mathsf{C I}}=1.08-1.13;p$   $p$  -value  $=4.8\mathrm{E}{\cdot}17)$  ) ( Fig. 3 ); (CC vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.19$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=1.13\textrm{--}1.26,$  ;   $p$  -value   $=9$  .4E-12; CG vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.10$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=$  1.06  –  1.14;  $p$  -value  $=1.1\mathrm{E}{-07}$  ;  $\mathtt{C C}+\mathtt{C G}$   vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.13$  ,   $95\%\;{\sf I I}=$  1.10  –  1.17;  $p$  -value  $=1.1\mathrm{E}{–}13$  ; CC vs   $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}$  :  $\mathrm{OR}=1.18$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=$  1.06  –  1.31;  $p$  -value  $=0.0019$  ; ( Table 1 ) ( Supplementary Figure S1-S4 ).  The stratified results based on diseases showed statistically significant  relation of SNP with CAD under all genetic comparison (C vs G:   $\mathrm{OR}=$  1.15,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.07-1.24;p$  -value  $=0.0003$  ; CC vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,1.27$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}=1.19-1.36$  ;  $p$  -value  $:=9.6\mathrm{E}{-13}$  ; CG vs GG:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.12$  ,   $95\%$   CI  $=$  1.07  –  1.17;  $p$  -value  $=4.8\mathrm{E{-}07;\mathrm{CC}+\mathrm{CG}}$   vs GG:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.17$  ,   $95\%$   CI  $=$  1.12  –  1.22;  $p$  -value  $=1.2\mathrm{E}–12$  ; CC vs   $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}$  :  $\mathrm{OR}=1.25$  ,   $95\%$   CI  =

However,  acute pan cr eat it is, bronchial asthma, T1D, and T2D revealed no statis­ tically significant association with SNP. However, the ethnicity-based  stratified results revealed a statistically significant association between  SNP and overall disease risk in the Asian ethnic community through all  five genetic comparisons (C vs G:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.36$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathbf{CI}=1.19-1.55;p$   $p$  value  $=5.2\mathrm{E}–06$  ; CC vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.75$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.44-2.12;P$   $p$  -value  $=$  1.4E-08; CG vs GG:   $\mathrm{OR}=1.32$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.16-1.51;p$   $p$  -value  $=3.2\mathrm{E}–05$  ;

However, the   $\mathit{I L}–6\mathit{~$  gene rs1800795  polymorphism showed no significant association with overall disease  risk in Caucasian and African ethnicity ( Table 1 ).  

Furthermore, subgroup analyses based on the source of control  populations showed that  174G/C polymorphism is significantly asso­ − ciated with overall disorder risk for population-based control population  under the genetic model of   $(\mathsf{C C}+\mathsf{C G}$   vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.07$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}=1.02\,-$  1.13;  $p$  -value  $=0.0119.$  ) whereas the hospital-based control populations  showed significant association under all genetic models (C vs G:   $\mathrm{OR}=$  1.17,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.06-1.28;p$  -value  $=0.0012$  ; CC vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.31$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathbf{CI}=1.11-1.54;_{P}$   $p$  -value  $=0.001$  5; CG vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.13$  ,  $95\%\,{\sf C I}=1.08$  –  1.18;  $p$  -value  $=2.0\mathrm{E}.08$  ;  $\mathtt{C C}+\mathtt{C G}$   vs GG:  $\mathrm{OR}=1.17$  ,  $95\%\;{\sf C I}=1.12\,-$  1.22;  $p$  -value  $=1.2\mathrm{E}–13$  ; CC vs   $\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}$  :   $\mathrm{OR}=1.25$  ,   $95\%~{\tt C I}=1.09~-$  1.44;  $p$  -value  $=0.0019$  ) ( Table 1 ).

Sources of heterogeneity:  The results of this meta-analysis showed  that the significant heterogeneity of the  IL-6  rs1800795   $(.174\,\mathrm{\bf~G}/\mathrm{\bfC})$    polymorphism for overall disorder risks under all genetic comparison [C  vs G:  $\mathsf{Q}=746.33$  ,  ${\mathsf{d f}}=148$  ,  $p$  - value  $=\mathord{<\!}0.0001$  ,  $\tau^{2}=0.14$  ,  $I^{2}=80.17\%$  ;  CC vs GG:  $\mathsf Q=467.11$  ,  ${\mathsf{d f}}=148$  ,  $p$  -value   $=\mathord{<\!}0.0001$  ,   $\tau^{2}=0.32$  ,  $I^{2}=$   $68.32\;\%$  ; CC vs   $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}$  :  $\mathsf{Q}=535.72$  , df  $=148$  ,  $p$  -value  $=\mathord{<\!}0.0001$  ,   $\tau^{2}$  2   $=0.18$  ,  $I^{2}=72.37\%$   $\mathtt{C C}+\mathtt{C G}$  vs GG:  ${\sf Q}=632.3$  ,   ${\mathsf{d f}}=148$  ,  $p$  -value  $=$   $\mathord{<\!}0.0001$  ,   $\tau^{2}\!=\!0.20$  = =  76.59%; CG vs  $\mathbf{CC}+\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}$  :  $\mathsf{Q}=399.99$  ,  ${\mathsf{d f}}=148$  ,   $p$  p -value  $=\mathord{<\!}0.0001$  ,  $\tau^{2}=0.21$  ,  $I^{2}=63.0\%]$   ( Supplementary Table S3 ).  The stratified analysis based on disease type and ethnicity was also  executed to check the significant sources of heterogeneity.

a  Statistical power was calculated using the number of observations and the corresponding ORs and  $p$  -  values in each subgroup.  b  The level of the false-positive report probability threshold was set at 0.2 and noteworthy findings were presented in this Table.  

rheumatoid arthritis, T1D, T2D, Asians, Caucasians, and African pop­ ulations were the main sources of heterogeneity ( Supplementary  Table S3 ).  

Sensitivity analysis:  We examined the sensitivity of this analysis by  removing the studies which did not pass the HWE test. The overall re­ sults were not significantly altered the association by eliminating 20  studies. Therefore, the results generated through this study were both  stable and robust ( Table 1 ).  

Publication bias checking:  The Begg ’ s funnel plot of  IL-6  rs1800795  polymorphism showed the symmetric distribution of OR in terms of  standard error ( Fig. 4 ). Also, the Egger linear regression test [C vs G:  $\mathbf{t}=$  0.41,  ${\mathsf{d f}}=147$  ,  $p$  -value  $=0.6790$  ; CC vs GG:  $\mathsf{t}=0.75$  ,   ${\mathsf{d f}}=147$  ,  $p$  -value 

  $=0.4516]$   and rank correlation test [C vs G:  $\mathbf{z}=\!0.58$  ,  $p$  -value  $=0.5645$  ;  CC vs GG:  $\mathbf{z}=\cdot0.05$  ,  $p$  - value  $=0.9594]$   suggested that no publication  bias was present ( Supplementary Table S4 ).  

False positive report probability   $(F P R P)$   and power analyses:  To  determine whether associations previously reported were false posi­ tives, a false-positive report probability (FPRP) analysis was computed.  After investigating the association, we found that the   $I L–6$  gene  rs1800795 polymorphism significantly increases the risk of overall  disorders. Moreover, this SNP is significantly associated with the sub­ group of CAD and rheumatoid arthritis, and overall disease risk for Asian  and hospital-based control populations ( Table 2 ).  

Trial sequential analysis (TSA):  In this meta-analysis, TSA was used  to analyze the allelic (C vs G) and homozygote (CC vs GG) models for  estimating the required information size (RIS). The analyzed data  showed that the RIS is 31,394 and 34,280 subjects to demonstrate the  issues for allelic and homozygote models, respectively ( Fig. 5 ). For both  models, the Z-curve crossed the conventional boundary and the required  information size has been reached. Therefore, the TSA results confirmed  that the  IL-6  rs1800795 polymorphism was associated with overall  disease risk and no need to add further relevant trials, which also rep­ resented that our results were robust and crucial ( Fig. 5 ).  

# 4. Discussion  

The importance of common genetic variants in the pathogen es is and  aetiology of human diseases is highlighted by genome research. It has  been demonstrated that the  IL-6  gene promoter variant rs1800795 af­ fects  $\mathit{I L}–6\mathit{~$    transcription and secretion, and these changes are considered

to be important risk factors for human disorders ( Kerget and Kerget,  2021; Trovato et al., 2021; Deloukas, et al., 2013; Eyre, et al., 2012 ). In  this study, we conducted an updated statistical meta-analysis to make a  consensus decision more accurately about the association of  $\mathit{I L}–6\mathit{~$    gene  rs 1800795 polymorphism with multiple disease risks. The updated re­ sults generated by this study were evaluated and compared using the  goodness of fit test with the previously published similar studies. This  meta-analysis suggested that the   $C$    allele of   $-174\mathsf{G}\;>\;\mathsf{C}$   SNP was  significantly associated with increasing the risk of overall disease under  all genetic comparisons. The subgroup results under ethnicity type  showed that SNPs and overall disease risk in Asian populations are  significantly correlated. Again, the subgroup analyses stratified by dis­ ease type revealed that the  $-174\mathsf{G}>\mathsf{C}$   SNP significantly increased the  risk for CAD which is in line with findings of previous single-case meta-analyses CAD ( Rai et al., 2021; Salari, et al., 2021; Lu, et al., 2020 ). We  also observed that susceptibility to inflammatory disease was signifi­ cantly influenced by the   $-174\mathsf{G}>\mathsf{C}$   SNP which was validated by a  previous study ( Liu et al., 2021 ). The risk of ischemic stroke was  significantly decreased which contradicted the findings of a previous  meta-analysis ( Chai et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the   $-174\mathtt{G}\;>\;\mathtt{C}$   SNP  significantly increased the risk for rheumatoid arthritis for all pop­ ulations but the previous meta-analysis reported a significant associa­ tion only with Asians ( Shao, et al., 2022 ). However, our study found no  significant connection of   $-174\mathtt{G}\;>\;\mathtt{C}$   SNP with acute pan cr eat it is,  bronchial asthma, T1D, and T2D, those were matched with previously  published reports ( Xu et al., 2013; Zhu, 2019 ).  

To understand more clearly the ethnicity-based SNPs variation and  propensity to diseases, we searched three publically accessible SNPs  databases, including the 1000 Genome Browser (Phase 3) ( Clarke, et al.,  1000 ), the NCBI variation database dbSNP ( NCBI Handout Series, 2014 ),  and PGG.SNV ( Zhang, et al., 2019 ), to assess the existing understanding  of allele frequency for the  $I\!L\!\cdot\!6$    variant rs  $1800795\;\mathrm{G}/\mathrm{C}$   across the global  population ( Fig. 6 a). Retrieving data, we found the subgroup-based  allelic distribution for the  $C$    allele is much less common in the African  and Asian populations while fairly common in the White populations  ( Fig. 6 b). Also, using the PGG.SNV database we evaluated the conser­ vation score of the  IL-6  gene rs1800795 polymorphism, where three  different scoring methods predicted the effect of this polymorphism as  damaging with high conservation scores ( Fig. 6 c). The scores demon­ strated that this polymorphism might alter its function which in turn  might be related to altered regulations and susceptibility to diseases.  show abnormality and it may affect the disease development.  

In this meta-analysis, there were some advantages and limitations/  disadvantages in making a consensus decision about the association of  IL-6  rs1800795 SNP with multiple diseases. The advantages of this study  were: (i) the pooled effect was estimated considering multiple diseases,  

![](images/339edb3f884cd126d5f8e839ffa3ee624a63d1d6671d6266ac22cac56d461e12.jpg)  

where no previous meta-analysis did consider this issue ( Chai et al.,  2022; Rai et al., 2021; Shao, et al., 2022; Salari, et al., 2021; Tabaei  et al., 2020; Lu, et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2013; Cheng, et al., 2021; Li, et al.,  2015; Zhu, 2019; Liu et al., 2021 ), (ii) the sample size was larger  compared to subgroup analysis with other individual single case meta-analyses, (iii) several statistical methods were employed to assess the  included data than any previously reported meta-analysis to validate the  significance of associations. Whereas, the disadvantage or limitations of  this study were: (i) only the English language articles in which full  datasets were available were considered for this meta-analysis, (ii) some  heterogeneity factors for example age, sex, smoking, drinking, blood  pressure, family history, etc were not considered to estimate the pooled  effect for overall or subgroup analysis, and (iii) some subgroup results  might be affected because of the smaller sample sizes. Despite the few  limitations, this study accurately determined the relationship between  the   $\mathit{I L}–6\mathit{~$    gene rs1800795 polymorphism and the risks of multiple dis­ eases including coronary artery diseases (CAD), acute pan cr eat it is,  bronchial asthma, inflammatory diseases, ischemic stroke, rheumatoid  arthritis, type 1 Diabetes (T1D), and type 2 diabetes (T2D).  

# 5. Conclusion  

This meta-analysis revealed a highly significant association of the  $I L$  -  6  gene rs1800795 polymorphism with overall disorder risk, especially  for Asian populations under all genetic models. Moreover, this SNP has  demonstrated a statistically strong association with increased risk for  CAD, inflammatory diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis and decreased  risk for ischemic stroke after subgroup analysis based on disease types.  However, no significant association was found with T1D, T2D, and other  included diseases under any five genetic models. Taken together, the  results of this study suggest that   $I L–6$    could be a useful prognostic  biomarker for CAD, inflammatory diseases, ischemic stroke, and rheu­ matoid arthritis.
