Abstract Previous studies have shown associations of fetuin-A (alpha  $^2$  -Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein, AHSG) with various disorders, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis. In this study, genotype and allele frequencies of the rs4918 SNP in the  AHSG  gene were examined in 380 patients with ischemic stroke and 350 healthy controls from a Northern Han Chinese population via the PCR-RFLP technique. Frequencies of the GG genotype and the G allele in  AHSG  (rs4918) were sign i cant ly higher in patients with ischemic stroke or at hero sclerotic cerebral infarction than those in the control group   $(P<0.05)$  ). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated the sign i can ce

of rs4918 in these patients, after adjustment for confounding factors   $(P<0.05)$  ). These ﬁndings suggest that rs4918 SNPs of the  AHSG  gene are associated with a risk for ischemic stroke in a Northern Han Chinese population.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a major health hazard. In 2008, an estimated 17.3 million people died of cardiovascular disease, representing   $30\%$   of deaths worldwide. Approximately 6.2 million of these deaths were due to stroke (World Health Organization report:  http:// www.who.int/ ). In China, it is estimated that 2.5 million people suffer strokes each year (Johnston et al.  2009 ), with an average incidence and mortality rates from stroke higher than the global averages (Wu et al.  2001 ).  

There are two types of stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic (Zhang et al.  2003 ). In China,   $73.5\%$   of reported strokes are ischemic, with a higher incidence   $(80.3\%)$   in the northeastern region of China (Jin et al.  2012 ). Stroke occurrence may be related to many factors, including age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, heart disease, high homo cyst eine levels, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. During clinical treatment, however, the risk of stroke remains after controlling for these conventional risk factors. Therefore, it is important to identify unknown susceptibility factors. Epidemiological studies of different races have revealed that genetic factors are crucial (Cheng et al.  2008 ; Milton et al.  2011 ; Meschia et al.  2011 ). One study noted a recent increase in the ident i cation of genetic variants associated with stroke and other cerebro vascular and cardiovascular events (Maa´sz et al.  2011 ). Thus, genetic variations may be independent risk factors for ischemic stroke.  

Fetuin-A (alpha  $^{2}$  -Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein, AHSG) belongs to the cysteine protease inhibitory factor superfamily (Ishibashi et al.  2010 ). Fetuin-A is mainly synthesized and secreted by the liver cells, and it is present at high concentrations in the serum (Stefan et al.  2006 ). As a negative acute-phase glycoprotein with complex and diverse biological functions, fetuin-A has been demonstrated to show anti-in amma tory properties (Basar et al.  2011 ). Experiments in animals and in vitro have shown that fetuin-A is related to vascular calc i cation and bone metabolism (Mori et al.  2011 ), insulin resistance (Stefan et al.  2006 ; Mori et al.  2006 ; Mathews et al.  2002 ), adipocyte dysfunction (Dahlman et al.  2004 ; Lavebratt et al.  2005a ; Hennige et al.  2008 ), in amma tion (Jahnen-Dechent et al. 1997 ; Price and Lim,  2003 ), and atherosclerosis (Fiore et al.  2007 ).  

Although the path o physiological basis of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis, contradictory ﬁndings have been reported regarding its association with fetuin-A. According to some studies (Stenvinkel et al.  2005 ; Ketteler et al.  2003 ), lower fetuin-A levels had important effects on in amma tion, atherosclerosis (carotid plaques), and cardiovascular disease; however, the subjects of these studies had renal disease. In contrast, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study (Weikert et al.  2008 ) showed that high plasma fetuin-A levels were associated with myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, suggesting that fetuin-A may inﬂuence the path o physiology of cardiovascular disease. Tutto lomond o et al. ( 2010 ), whose ﬁndings supported the conclusions of Weikert et al. ( 2008 ), proposed fetuin-A as a candidate pro in amma tory marker of ischemic stroke. Vo¨ro¨s et al. ( 2011 ) reported elevated serum fetuin-A levels among 171 Hungarian patients with previous myocardial infarction and normal renal function.  

The human  AHSG  gene is located on chromosome 3q27, contains seven exons, and spans   $8.2~\mathrm{k}\mathsf{b}$   of genomic DNA (Siddiq et al.  2005 ). This segment of DNA contains genetic susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome (Kissebah et al.  2000 ; Vionnet et al.  2000 ; Francke et al.  2001 ) that are risk factors of cerebro vascular disease. Because fetuin-A is an  AHSG  product, researchers have hypothesized that there may be a relationship between the gene and ischemic stroke (Fisher et al.  2009 ). Previous studies showed that SNPs of the AHSG  gene (rs4917) were sign i cant ly associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction in a European population (Fisher et al.  2009 ), and  AHSG (rs4918) was associated with type 2 diabetes (Siddiq et al.  2005 ). In a study of European Americans with diabetes, although combinations of alleles of three SNPs of  AHSG  (rs4917, rs1029353, and rs4918) were associated with calciﬁed plaques of the coronary arteries, they were not associated with vascular calc i cation, body mass index, fetuin-A levels, or diabetes (Lehtinen et al.  2007 ). Therefore, the relationship between the  AHSG  SNPs and ischemic stroke in humans remains controversial, and there is a need for further studies of the association in different races and populations.  

Although the incidence of ischemic stroke in China continues to increase each year, no study to date has examined the relationship between AHSG polymorphisms and stroke in a Northern Han Chinese population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship between SNPs of  AHSG  (rs4918) and the risk of developing ischemic stroke in a Northern Han Chinese population.  

# Materials and Methods  

Subjects  

Study subjects were from outpatient and inpatient services at the First Afﬁliated Hospital of the China Medical University and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army 202 Hospital. This case-control study included 380 patients with ischemic stroke (229 males) and 350 unrelated normal healthy control subjects (201 males) recruited from October 2010 to March 2011.  

All patients with ischemic stroke were diagnosed after they had experienced a sudden loss of global or focal cerebral function and a corresponding infarction was observed on brain imaging by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with transient ischemic attack were excluded from the study. According to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST; Tutto lomond o et al.  2012 ), ischemic stroke can be divided into two subtypes:

at hero sclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) and lacunar infarct (LAC). Stroke patients were placed into the corresponding subgroups during analysis (Table  1 ). Individuals with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, cerebro vascular disease, or cardiovascular disease were excluded from the control group. Subjects in the control group were from the same geographic areas as the cases and were matched in age and gender with the cases.  

Clinical data, including incidence rates of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, hyper lipid emi a, and gender, were recorded for all study participants. All subjects provided their written informed consent to participate in the study, and the experimental protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the hospital. According to the criteria of the World Health Organization, hypertension was deﬁned as systolic blood pressure    $\geq140~\mathrm{mmHg}$   or diastolic blood pressure  $\geq90~\mathrm{mmHg}$   from an average of three measurements, or a current prescription for anti hypertensive medications. Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was based on a fasting glucose level  $\geq7.8\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$   and/or a glucose level  $\geq11.1\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$   at  $2\textbf{h}$   after oral glucose challenge. Smoking status was deﬁned as 3 or more cigarettes per day for at least 2 years. Alcohol consumption was deﬁned as at least 10 grams of alcohol per day.  

Biochemical Parameters and Genotype Determination  

Human genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood samples with the Wizard Genomic DNA Pur i cation Kit (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fragments of the  AHSG  gene were ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using isolated genomic DNA as the template and speciﬁc primers. The ampliﬁed fragments were digested with a speciﬁc endorestriction enzyme (Table  2 ) and characterized by   $3\%$   agarose gel electrophoresis. The resulting restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to

determine the SNPs of the genes. Some DNA fragments from each genotype of random samples were further cloned and conﬁrmed by sequencing. The genotypes were identical to those from the ﬁrst round of genotyping. The allele and genotype frequencies were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Li et al.  2010 ).  

# Statistical Analysis  

Biological and clinical data of the case and control groups were analyzed by Student’s  $t$   test (age and body mass index) and a chi-square test (sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a, smoking, and alcohol consumption). The chi-square test was also used on  $2\times2$   and  $2\times3$   contingency tables to analyze allele and genotype associations. For each gene variant, the odds ratio and   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval were calculated to measure the genetic association with ischemic stroke. The association of each studied polymorphism with ischemic stroke was analyzed by stratifying the individual confounding factors. Logistic regression analysis was applied, after adjustment for the confounding variables (diabetes, hypertension, hyper lipid emi a, smoking, and alcohol consumption), with 0 for the negative result and 1 otherwise.  

All statistical tests were performed with the SPSS software package for Windows (version 17.0). The genotype frequencies of each SNP marker were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by the SHEsis program ( http://analysis.Bio-x.cn/ myanalysis.php ). A two-tailed  $P$   value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. A post hoc statistical power analysis was performed using   $\mathbf{G}^{*}$  Power software version 3.1.  

# Results  

There were no signiﬁcant differences in age, sex, or body mass index between the control and case groups or between the case group subtypes (Table  1 ). Subjects in the case group had a higher prevalence of conventional vascular risk factors, including a history of hypertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a, alcohol consumption, and smoking. These results suggested that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a, alcohol consumption, and smoking may contribute to the development of ischemic stroke in the Northern Han Chinese population.  

The distribution of rs4918 genotypes (Table  3 ) was consistent with HardyWeinberg equilibrium in the case and control groups. Compared with the

frequencies in the control group, higher frequencies were observed for the recessive GG genotype of  AHSG  rs4918 in the case group   $(P=0.021)$  ) and the ACI group  $\textstyle P=0.012)$  ), and higher frequencies were observed for the   $\mathbf{G}$   allele in the case group   $(P=0.006)$  ) and the ACI group   $\left(P=0.003\right)$  ). No signiﬁcant differences in the genotype   $(P=0.086)$  ) and allele   $(P=0.229)$  ) frequencies of  AHSG  rs4918 were observed between the control subjects and the LAC group. Post hoc statistical power analysis with a sample size of 730, effect size of 0.099, and    $\propto$   of 0.05 revealed a statistical power of   $76.27\%$  .  

An analysis of the association of  AHSG  with ischemic stroke (Table  4 ) showed that the frequency of the recessive GG genotype in the  AHSG  SNP rs4918 was higher in patients with ischemic stroke   $(P=0.021)$  ) or ACI (  $P=0.012\$  ) than that in controls. The frequency of the dominant CC genotype was markedly lower in the stroke patients   $(46.1\%)$   or the ACI group   $(42.7\%)$   than in controls   $(56\%)$  . The frequency of the  $\mathrm{GC+CG}$   genotype was higher in patients with ischemic stroke or ACI than in controls   $(P<0.01)$  . Therefore, we performed a logistic regression analysis on  $\mathrm{GC+GC/CC}$   in the case and ACI groups.  

Logistic regression analysis veriﬁed the sign i can ce of rs4918 in the case and ACI groups, after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, and other conventional risk factors   $(P<0.05\$  ; Table  4 ). In the case group, the risk for subjects with at least one   $\mathbf{G}$   allele (the GG or CG genotype) affecting ischemic stroke was 1.484 times the risk for the CC genotype, and the risk in the ACI group was 1.667 times the CC genotype. Overall, our data suggest that the  AHSG  rs4918 polymorphisms were associated with ischemic stroke in the Northern Han Chinese population.  

# Discussion  

The incidence of ischemic stroke is increasing in China. Studies in various races have reported that certain SNPs can increase the risk of developing ischemic stroke (Lo˜hmussaar et al.  2005 ; Ji et al.  2011 ; Yoon et al.  2011 ). In this report, we used a common method to evaluate the potential relationship between  AHSG  gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke in a Northern Han Chinese population. Our study is the ﬁrst to provide evidence for an independent association between  AHSG rs4918 and ischemic stroke in China.  

The  AHSG  rs4918 (Thr256Ser) SNP has been associated with serum fetuin-A levels (Osawa et al.  2005 ), leanness (Lavebratt et al.  2005b ), and type 2 diabetes (Siddiq et al.  2005 ). Lavebratt et al. ( 2005a ) concluded that rs4917, a common variation in the  AHSG  gene, was associated with a marked increase in 2-adrenoceptor sensitivity in subcutaneous fat cells, which may be important in body weight regulation. Osawa et al. ( 2005 ) showed that the  AHSG  gene may inﬂuence skeletal development and chronic disorders, such as vascular calc i cation. Together, these observations indicate that it may be related to ischemic stroke pathogen es is.  

The EPIC-Potsdam study (with 214 myocardial infarction s, 154 ischemic strokes, 2152 controls) by Fisher et al. ( 2009 ) conﬁrmed that the rs4917 C allele of  AHSG was sign i cant ly associated with myocardial infarction and a 1.07-fold increase in future ischemic stroke risk in a European population. They examined the hypothesis that  AHSG  polymorphisms were directly related to cardiovascular disease risk, due to changes in fetuin-A blood levels. The contradiction in the  AHSG  results between myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke in the study from Fisher et al. ( 2009 ) indicates that the path oph y sio logic mechanisms of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke are complex and not completely consistent, and that it is necessary to verify the ﬁndings in various races. In a study of 829 European American patients with diabetes, Lehtinen et al. ( 2007 ) found that polymorphisms of the  AHSG  gene could affect the extent of calciﬁed plaques of the coronary arteries, but they observed no association between the rs4917 and rs4918 polymorphisms and vascular calc i cation, body mass index, diabetes, or serum fetuin-A levels.  

Song et al. ( 2011 ) found that higher fetuin-A levels were associated with diabetes and insulin resistance in a middle-aged and elderly Chinese population. However, because no previous study has assessed whether  AHSG  is associated with ischemic stroke risk in China, we evaluated whether the gene polymorphism was associated with ischemic stroke risk in a Northern Han Chinese population. Our ﬁndings showed that the GG genotype and G allele frequencies of  AHSG  (rs4918) in ischemic stroke and ACI patients were sign i cant ly higher than those in unrelated healthy controls. No signiﬁcant association was observed among the rs4918 polymorphisms and LAC. Logistic regression analysis conﬁrmed the sign i can ce of rs4918 in the ischemic stroke and ACI groups, after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, and other conventional risk factors. Therefore, the  AHSG  rs4918 GG genotype might be an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke and ACI in the Northern Han Chinese population, with its risk mainly being derived from the G allele. Our observation of the independent association between  AHSG  rs4918 polymorphisms and risk for ischemic stroke is unique, because previous studies have reported  AHSG  rs4918 polymorphisms only in the context of type 2 diabetes (Siddiq et al.  2005 ).  

The use of different ethnic populations, study subjects, and sample sizes may lead to differences in genotype and allele frequencies among studies. Moreover, the mechanisms of association of the  AHSG  gene with ischemic stroke are still unknown. We did not directly study the relationship with serum fetuin-A levels. Although AHSG is an anti-in amma tory, negative acute-phase glycoprotein, we do not have sufﬁcient evidence to draw conclusions regarding its mechanism in in amma tion. Vo¨ro¨s et al. ( 2011 ) proposed that the association between AHSG and atherosclerosis in post-myocardial infarction patients most likely involved insulin resistance, obesity, and adipocyte dysfunction rather than in amma tion. Additional investigations in larger populations of Chinese individuals will be needed to examine more SNPs of  AHSG . Given that  AHSG  polymorphisms can alter the expression of fetuin-A, we are interested in characterizing fetuin-A levels in patients with ischemic stroke to explore the mechanism between the gene and ischemic stroke. Overall, our study provides molecular epidemiologic data that may be used to enhance our understanding of the potential genetic mechanisms of ischemic stroke and to aid in its early diagnosis.  

In conclusion, this is the ﬁrst report to show a relationship between  AHSG  rs4918 polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk in a Northern Han Chinese population. Considering the limitations of this study, we intend to continue exploring the association of these polymorphisms with ischemic stroke in a larger Han Chinese population with more SNPs in the  AHSG  gene and to study their molecular mechanisms.
