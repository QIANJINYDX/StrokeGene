# Abstract  

Intra cranial at hero sclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke (IS), especially in recurrent patients. Several studies have demonstrated an intimate association between the genetic mutation of the  KALRN  gene and IS. The main aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of  KALRN  and ICAS in a northern Chinese population and further explore the underlining mechanism. The relationship between each SNP and ICAS and the related components were examined in five models (co-dominant, dominant, recessive, heterozygous, and additive). Multivariate logistic regression models were applied and adjusted for 10,000 permutation tests. Haplotype regression analysis was performed to determine the associations between haplotypes and the severity of ICAS. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the mRNA level of  Kalirin . SNP rs6438833 of the  Kalirin  gene in the additive model was associated with ICAS   $\mathrm{{OR}}=1.642$  ,  $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.129-2.388,  $P_{\mathrm{Dom}}\,{=}\,0.048)$  ). After performing 10,000 permutations, the result showed a trend toward statistical significance   $(P\mathrm{per}\!=\!0.048)$  ). Haplotypes of the  KALRN  gene were not significantly associated with ICAS (global significance,  $p\!=$  0.090). qRT-PCR showed that the expression of  KALRN 9  in IS patients was almost threefold the control group   $(p\!<\!0.0005)$  . SNPs of the  KALRN  gene are associated with ICAS in the northern Chinese population.

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS), a leading cause of death worldwide, has reached an epidemic level with a morbidity rate of 276.9/100,000 each year in China. Of all the facors, in- tracranial at hero sclerotic stenosis (ICAS) ranks as the most common e tio logical contributor (Gorelick et al. 2008 ; Liu et al.  2007 ). Nowadays, for IS patients, thrombolytic therapy and angioplasty remain two common treatment options. However, they only alleviate the symptoms and cannot eradicate the cause. Therefore, recent attention has been drawn to the application of gene therapy for IS treatment (Bevan et al.  2012 ; Li et al.  2014 ; Yuan et al.  2013 ).  

As a vital gene,  KALRN  is closely related to several central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as schizophrenia, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD) (Hayashi-Takagi et al.  2014 ; Iasevoli et al.  2014 ; Moyer et al.  2015 ).  KALRN  mutation has also been documented to be associated with IS in China ’ s main ethnic peoples (Dang et al.  2015 ). However, the relationship between  KALRN  mutation and ICAS and the underlining mechanisms still largely remain obscure.  Kalirin , a protein encoded by the  KALRN  gene, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). It promotes the transition of GDP to GTP, which consequently activates the activity of specific Rho GTPase that plays a pivotal role in the formation and development of spine/ synapse (Mandela and Ma  2012 ). About the possible role of  KALRN  in stroke, some researches insist that  Kalirin -9 can promote neointimal hyperplasia and SMC proliferation, leading to atherosclerosis by decreasing NO production through the PAK1 signaling pathway. The KALRN  gene has many isoforms. Among them,  Kalirin - 7, mainly expressed in the CNS, is a critical regulator of dendritic spine remodeling in schizophrenia and AD and also associated with ischemic signal transduction (Beresewicz et al.  2008 ; Cahill et al.  2012 ; Jones et al. 2014 ), while  Kalirin -9, mainly expressed outside the CNS, may promote smooth muscle cell (SMC) Rac 1 activation, migration, proliferation, and induce CAD or athero sclerosis (Wu et al.  2013 ).  

The present study attempted to clarify the relationship between  Kalirin  mutations and ICAS in a northern Chinese population, in which ICAS has a high morbidity and lethality. It may provide a new potential approach to gene therapy targeting  Kalirin  for patients with ICAS and IS.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Subjects  

A cohort of 736 individuals, including 243 IS patients hop it aliz ed in the Neurology Department of the 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University and 493 healthy blood donors, were enrolled in the present study. The subjects were unrelated to one another. All IS cases were diagnosed by DSA or MRA and displayed the location and severity of artery plaques. Patients with a history of cerebro vascular malformation or trauma were excluded. Detailed information concerning the subjects ’  gender, age, blood pressure, glucose, lipids, smoking, and alcohol abuse was collected by standard laboratory procedures. All participants granted their written informed consent before their examination. The study protocol observed the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and was approved by the Local Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board of the 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University.  

# Evaluation of the Cerebral At hero sclerotic Stenosis by DSA and MRA  

The severity of cerebro vascular atherosclerosis in bilateral common carotid arteries, internal carotid arteries, vert ebro basil ar artery, middle cerebral artery, and anterior and posterior cerebral artery was evaluated by DSA and MRA according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid End art erect o my Trial Standard (Kappelle et al.  1999 ). At hero sclerotic lesions in intracranial arteries on MRA or DSA images were visually graded: 0, no stenosis; 1, stenosis   ${<}50\%$  ; 2, stenosis of  $50\%–99\%$  ; and 3, occlusion (Ryoo et al.  2015 ). In the current study, 1 was defined as slight stenosis and 2 as severe stenosis.  

# Candidate SNPs Selection  

In our previous study, we found that three SNPs of KALRN  were closely related to IS in the Chinese Han ethnic population. All SNPs are located in introns with SNP rs7620580, rs17286604, and rs6438833 encoding Kalirin -7,  Kalirin -9, and  Kalirin -12, respectively. Genomic DNA was extracted with the method proposed by Lahiri and Numberger (Lahiri and Nurnberger  1991 ).  

# Genetic Analysis  

The genotyping of  KALRN  was performed using the ligase detection reaction (LDR). The target DNA sequences were amplified with a multiplex PCR method with specific primers. Promoter primer information was as follows: rs17286604, sense 5-C TT TTC CT CAT GT G GAAGGC-3 and anti-sense 5-C TTT GA CGT GATA A CCACCC-3; rs7620580, sense 5-CACACTAA GC A GAC AGT CCA-3 and anti-sense 5-GGACCCAG A GCC TTT T TACA-3; rs6438833, sense5-AGTGCTTT GC TG AGT GTA CC-3 and anti-sense 5-GGTAATTA TA A A CACA ACA GC-3. Briefly, the target DNA sequences were amplified as follows in a   $20~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   reaction system with the Gene Amp PCR system 9600 (Perkin Elmer, American): an initial de natura tion at  $95\ \mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $2\,\mathrm{\min}$   and subsequent 35 cycles of denaturation at   $94\ \mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{~s~}$  , annealing at   $50~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $45\,\mathrm{~s~}$  , extension at   $72\,\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30\ \mathrm{~s.~}$  , and final extension at  $72\,\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $10\;\mathrm{\min}$  . The PCR products were then sequenced wi th an ABI sequencer 377 (Life Technologies Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY), and the results were analyzed with Genemapper software. LDR was performed in a final volume of 24.05  $\upmu\mathrm{l}$   reaction mixture containing   $19\ \upmu\mathrm{l}$   buffer,   $1~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   probe mix   $(2\,\mathrm{\pmmol}/\upmu\mathrm{l}$   each probe),   $0.05\;\mathrm{~\textmu~}2\;\mathrm{~U~}$   ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and   $4~\upmu1~100~\mathrm{ng}/$   $\upmu\mathrm{l}$   PCR products. The quality of genotyping was controlled using blinded blood duplicates.  

# Real-Time Fluorescent Quantitative PCR  

Total RNA of the human blood was extracted by the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Reverse transcription with   $1.5~\upmu\mathrm{g}$   of RNA was finished using the Transcript or First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Ferments, Canada). qRT-PCR was performed with Fast Start Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche) using the StepOne Plus real-time PCR system (Life Technologies Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY). The values for each sample (for healthy control group,    $n=23$  , for IS group,    $n=25$  ) were normalized to the mRNA levels of human-keeping gene GAPDH. Fold changes were calculated by the   $2-\Delta(\Delta\mathrm{St})$   method   $\mathrm{.}\Delta\mathrm{ct=Ct}$   (target gene) – Ct (GAPDH);    $\Delta\Delta\mathrm{St}\!=\!\Delta\mathrm{St}$   (experimental groups, IS patients)  − mean    $\Delta\mathrm{St}$   (control groups)]. Primers used are as follows:  KALRN 9 (sense 5-CC TT G GT GG AT GT G ACCTGCTTG-3 and anti-sense5-AG GAGA CCG T GT AT GTGGCTGAG-3) and  GAPDH  (sense 5-CAGTGGCA A A G T G G A G AT T G T TG - 3 a n d a n t i - s e n s e 5- C TCG CT CC TG GAA GAT GG TG AT-3).  

# Statistical Analysis  

The quantitative and qualitative significance in physiology and biochemistry indices between cases and controls was compared by the    $t$   test and    $\chi2$   test.    $\chi2$   test was used to assess the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. SNP test software for Linux was used to analyze the correlation between each eligible SNP and the severity of ICAS in five genetic models — co-dominant, dominant, recessive, additive, and heterozygous. The logistic regression was adopted for backward elimination of risk factors, including gender, age, body index mass (BMI), SBP, DBP, glucose, dys lipid emi a, alcohol consumption, and smoking. The SHEsis software was employed to test the linkage d is equilibrium in the SNPs and to analyze the haplotype frequency (Song et al.  2008 ). The odds ratios (OR) with corresponding   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Ten thousand permutations for each model were performed to correct the multiple tests. A  $p$   value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  

# Results  

# Subject Characteristics  

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects were summarized in Table  1 . Age, BMI, history of hypertension and diabetes, HDL levels, LDL levels, smoking and alcohol intake were significantly different between IS patients and the controls as shown by univariate analysis. No significant difference was reported in gender and family history.  

# Correlation Between Cerebral vascular At hero sclerotic Stenosis and  KALRN  Polymorphism  

The genotype frequencies of  KALRN  SNPs in subjects were analyzed. Any polymorphism observed and expected was found in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (data not shown). The estimated risk analysis of  KALRN SNPs in IS patients and healthy controls was tested according to the five models (co-dominant, dominant, recessive, heterozygous, and additive), to adjust for cerebro vascular risk factors (Table  2 ). A significant difference was observed in the additive model: the rs6438833 polymorphism was markedly correlated with ICAS (  $(\mathrm{OR}=1.642$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.129-2.388,    $P_{\mathrm{Dom}}\,{=}\,0.048)$  , which was maintained after the 10,000 permutations (  $(P{\sf p e r}\!=$  0.048).  KALRN  polymorphisms were also compared between the groups of slight ICAS or severe ICAS and the controls (Table  3 ), which revealed a statistical significance in the heterozygous model (  $(\mathrm{OR}=1.189$  ,  $95\%$  CI: 0.749-1.886,    $P_{\mathrm{Her}}\!=\!0.049\$  ). The rs7620580 polymorphism between patients with slight ICAS and controls was significantly different. After the 10,000 permutations, a marginal significance was evident (  $(P{\mathrm{per}}\!=$  0.051). All models were adjusted for age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, blood glucose, alcohol consumption, and smoking.  

# Linkage D is equilibrium Analysis  

The three  KALRN  polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium   $(\mathrm{D^{\circ}}\!>\!0.80)$   and  KALRN  haplotypes were not significantly correlated with ICAS (global significance,  $p\,{=}\,0.090$  ).  

# mRNA Expression of  KALRN 9  in the IS Group  

The results of additive model analysis showed a significant difference in the rs6438833 polymorphism between ICAS patients and the healthy control. To further confirm the expression of corresponding gene isoform KALRN 9 , qRT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA level of 23 healthy people and 25 patients with ICAS and IS. The result displayed that the expression of KALRN 9  in IS patients was almost threefold the control group (Fig.  1 ).  

# Discussion  

KALRN  has been documented to play an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases, such as CAD and atherosclerosis (Bevan et al.  2012 ; Wang et al.  2007 ). As cerebral atherosclerosis is characterized by ICAS and it is an important cause of ischemic stroke (Huang et al.  1997 ; Moossy  1993 ; Sacco et al.  1995 ), the present study evaluated the correlation between  KALRN  variants and ICAS.  

In our present study, significant correlation between  KALRN variants and ICAS was observed in the northern Chinese

population. The result showed that one haplotype, which consists of three SNPs, was noticeably correlated with ICAS even after the adjustment for potential con founders. The correlative analysis of each SNP and ICAS revealed that SNP rs6438833

in the subjects of the Additive model was significantly correlated with the ICAS, even after the 10,000 permutations. The results also coincide with that of the relationship between the KALRN  mutation and IS reported in previous studies (Krug et al.  2010 ). Similarly, our previous study confirms this association and further identifies its specific relation with lacunar infarction too (Dang et al.  2015 ). Taken together, this finding suggests that  KALRN  is closely associated with ICAS and the related gene isoform was  KALRN 9 . This relationship is further confirmed in our article, mRNA levels in the control group and ICAS patients were detected by qRT-PCR.  

SNP rs6438833, which is located in the intron, may regulate alternative splicing by affecting  KALRN  expression and exonic splicing enhancers or silencers and affecting or leading to alternative splicing of the  Kalirin  protein, generating isoforms. We further clarified this result by qRT-PCR, which showed threefold expression of  KALRN 9  in the IS group. Kalirin -9 activates Rac1 and PAK1 signaling, which is critical for SMC migration, and prevents NOS2 dimer iz ation, thus inhibiting the NOS2 activity. As NOS2 production of NO reduces SMC proliferation and mitochondrial respiration,  Kalirin -9 promotes neointimal hyperplasia and SMC proliferation, leading to atherosclerosis by decreasing NO production (Wu et al.  2013 ). This may explain why KALRN  rs6438833 is associated with ischemic stroke and ICAS.  

In our present study, we pinpointed the SNP mutation site of  KALRN  and finally demonstrated its correlation with ICAS — the most common cause of ischemic stroke at the gene level. We first demonstrate that variants of the KALRN  gene are significantly associated with ICAS and

in the Chinese population. These findings may have vital implications that ICAS can increase the risk of ischemic stroke for the mutation of  KALRN . Future prospective studies should be designed to expand samples enrolled and to include other populations in order to define the true role of these polymorphisms and provide more empirical evidence for the gene therapy targeting  KALRN 9  in stroke patients.
