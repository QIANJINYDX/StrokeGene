Summary:  Tetra hydro bio pt erin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for all three nitric oxide synthase (NOS  isoforms), which plays an important role in vascular diseases. GTP cy clo hydro las e 1 (GCH 1) is the  first-step and rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 biosynthesis in its  de novo  pathway. Common GCH1 gene  variant   $\mathsf{C}\!+\!243\mathrm{T}$   in the 3'-untranslated region predicts NO excretion. The present study examined the  predictive role of GCH 1 gene 3'-UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant in the long-term outcome of ischemic stroke. A  total of 142 patients with first-onset ischemic stroke were recruited and detected for genotype of GCH1  3'-UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   by a TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Subsequent vascular events and death were determined over a 5-year follow-up period.  The frequency of GCH1  3'-UTR    $+243\mathrm{~C/T}$   or   $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotype  was significantly increased in patients with endpoint events as compared with those without events   $74\%$   vs   $57.8\%$  ,   $P{=}0.06$  ).  Cox regression survival analysis indicated that an increased probability of  death or new vascular events was found in patients with GCH1 3'-UTR  $+243\;\mathrm{C/T}$   or T/T genotype compared with those with GCH1 3'-UTR C/C genotype   $40.6\%$    vs  $25.5\%$  ), GCH1 3'-UTR    $+243\mathrm{~C/T}$   or T/T  genotype relative to GCH1 3'-UTR   $\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{C}$   genotype was associated with the increased risk of death or  vascular events even after adjustment for other risk factors (  $.O R{=}2.171$  ,  $95\%$   CI: 1.066–4.424,  $\scriptstyle P=0.033$  ).  It was concluded that GCH1   $_3\prime$  -UTR    $\mathsf{C}\!+\!243\,\mathrm{T}$  variant was an independent predictor of worsening  long-term outcomes in patients with first-onset ischemic stroke.  

Key words:  GTP cy clo hydro las e 1; ischemic stoke; outcome; gene polymorphism   Nitric oxide (NO), produced by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), is an important bio regulatory molecule and  displays diverse biological activities . There are three  isoforms of NOS in mammals, neuronal NOS (nNOS),  inducible NOS (iNOS), and endo the li al NOS (eNOS).  Tetra hydro bio pt erin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for all  three NOS isoforms, and the basal enzyme activity correlates with the amount of BH4 bound tightly to   $\dot{\mathrm{NOS}}^{[2]}$  A large number of studies in cell cultures and animal  models have demonstrated that BH4 is a key regulator of  NO production . Insufficiency of BH4 would cause an  uncoupling of the L-arginine-NO pathway, which results  in formation of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite instead of NO which has been shown to be  involved in vascular diseases .  

GTP cy clo hydro las e 1 (GCH 1) is the first-step and  rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 biosynthesis in its de novo  pathway . Low brain level of BH4 had been shown in  the mouse model for dominantly inherited GCH1 deficiency . Study in cerebral infarction animal model indicated that endogenous GCH 1 activity, BH4 levels, iNOS  activity and superoxide anion and per oxy nitrite were all  augmented after ischemia/reperfusion, and selected  GCH1 inhibitor attenuated cerebral infarction via inhibiting iNOS and per oxy nitrite , which suggested that the  activity of GCH1 might be involved in the ischemic  brain injury and influence the prognosis of ischemic  stroke. However, it’s not known whether the activity of  GCH1 is associated with the long-term outcome of  ischemic stroke, especially in human being.  

Common GCH1 gene variant   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\,\mathrm{T}$   in the   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -untranslated region ( GCH1   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR  $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant )  was reported to be able to predict GCH1 activity and NO  excretion . In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that GCH1 3'-UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant was associated  with the long-term outcome of patients with ischemic  stroke. Thus, one hundred forty two patients with  first-onset ischemic stroke were investigated through a  5-year follow-up to identify the predictive role of GCH 1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant in the long-term outcome of  ischemic stroke.  

# 1 SUBJECTS AND METHODS  

# 1.1 Study Population  

This is a prospective study. One hundred forty two  patients with first-onset ischemic stroke were collected  through November 2000 to July 2001. Diagnosis of  stroke was made based on the results of strict clinical  medical history, neurological examination, magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography  (CT) according to the  International Classification of  Diseases ,  ninth revision . Other types of stroke, including  transient ischemic attack, hemorrhagic stroke, subarach- noid hemorrhage, embolic brain infarction, brain tumors,  and cerebro vascular malformation, and severe systemic  diseases such as collagen os is, endocrine and metabolic  disease (except diabetes mellitus), inflammation, liver,  neoplastic, or renal diseases were excluded.  

All patients were evaluated for detailed medical  history and family history, especially hypertension, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors such as cigarette smoking. Blood pressure was recorded and strict  physical examination performed by trained physicians.  

Blood of study subjects was drawn from an arm  vein into a sterile tube containing ethylene dia mine  tetra acetic acid. Fasting blood glucose, triglyceride (TG),  total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol  (LDL), high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were  detected. Genomic DNA was extracted using the  QG-Mini80 workflow with DB-S kit (FUJIFILM Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) as instructed. DNA was diluted  to a final concentration of   $10\;\mathrm{ng}/\upmu\mathrm{L}$   and stored at   $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  until genotyping.  

The study protocol was approved by the Review  Board of the Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Science and Technology of China and the Ethics Committees at the Tongji Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all individuals.  

# 1.2 Genotyping  

Genotype of GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   was detected  by a TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. The primer and  probe sequences of GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   polymorphism were provided by genotyping assay (ABI, USA).  The polymerase chain reaction for tagSNP was carried  out in  ${5}{\mathrm{-}}{\upmu}{\mathrm{L}}$   volume composed of   $2\times$   universal Mastermix  of   $2.5\;\upmu\mathrm{L}$   (ABI), two TaqMan probes at   $0.2\;\upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$   each,  two primers at   $0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{L}$   each and   $1\mathrm{-ng}/\upmu\mathrm{L}$   genomic  DNA. Thermal cycling conditions were performed as  follows:   $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $2~\mathrm{min}$  ,   $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for   $10~\mathrm{min}$  , and then 50  cycles at   $95\mathrm{^\circC}$   for   $15\mathrm{~s~}$   and   $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\ \mathrm{min}$  . Amplifications and reading fluorescence were carried out on the  ABI 7900HT instrument. Allelic discrimination was  measured automatically using the Sequence Detection  Systems 2.1 software (autocaller confidence level   $95\%$  ).  A total of   $10\%$   random samples were re-genotyped for  polymorphism, and all results were consistent.  

# 1.3 Follow-up and Clinical End points  

The clinical interviews were performed by home or  clinical visits and phone calls every year during the 5  years after the blood samples were collected. The investigation items in the follow-up included self-care ability,  blood pressure control, recurrence of stroke, cardiovascular events, and drug therapy. The primary end point  included acute myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and death, which were recorded.  

# 1.4 Statistical Analysis  

Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS statistical package, version 12.0. Statistical significance for  intergroup differences was   analyzed by the Student    $t$  test  for continuous variables and the   $\chi^{2}$    test for categorical  variables. The Cox regression technique was applied in  survival analysis, and was used to assess the Odds Ratio  for primary endpoint events during the 5 years of follow-up associated with GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant,  after adjustment for sex, age, body mass index (BMI),  blood cholesterol, hsCRP and other vascular risk factors  including history of hypertension, diabetes and smoking.  

# 2 RESULTS  

# 2.1 Primary Endpoint Events during the 5-year Follow-up in the Participants  

During the 5-year follow-up, a total of 50 patients  had a primary endpoint event. Thirty patients died among  whom 21 died due to vascular deaths (fatal stroke in 12,  failure after stroke in 6 and cardiovascular death in 3)  and 9 because of non vascular deaths (cancer in 4, renal  failure in 3, diabetes in 1, and anemia in 1). Twenty patients experienced recurrent non-fatal stroke. A total of 9  patients were lost during the follow-up, and the follow-up rate was   $93.7\%$  .  

# 2.2 Selected Baseline Characteristics of the Participants  

The patients with stroke were divided into two  groups based on the occurrence of primary endpoint  events (events group and no events group) during the  5-year follow-up. The baseline characteristics of the  study subjects are shown in table 1. The mean age and  hsCRP levels in stroke patients with endpoint events  were significantly higher than those in patients without  events. There was no significant difference in sex distribution, body mass index, blood pressure, HDL, TC, TG  and history of hypertension, diabetes and smoking between the group with events and the group without  events.

# 2.3 GCH1  $\mathbf{\lambda_{3}}\cdot$  -UTR  $\mathbf{C}{+}\mathbf{243T}$   Genotype Distributions in  Stroke Patients with Different Outcomes  

Genotype distributions and allele frequencies for  GCH1   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   in stroke patients with endpoint  events and without events during follow-up are showed  in table 2. No significant difference in  GCH1 3'-UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   genotype distribution and frequency of the T  allele was observed between patients with endpoint  events and those without events   $(45\%$    vs    $36.8\%$  ,   $P{=}0.183\$  ). However, the frequency of GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR  $+243\mathrm{~C/T~}$   or   $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotype was significantly increased in  patients with endpoint events compared with those  without events (  $74\%$    vs  $57.8\%$  ,    $P{=}0.06$  ).

# 2.4 GCH1   $\mathbf{\lambda_{3^{\prime}}}$  -UTR   $\mathbf{C}{+}\mathbf{243T}$   Genotype and Outcome of  Stroke during Follow-up  

In order to investigate the association of GCH1   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR  $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   genotype and outcome of stroke during  the 5-year follow-up, Cox regression survival analysis  was performed as showed in table 3 and figure 1, which  indicated that an increased probability of death or new  vascular events was found in patients with GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $+243\,\mathrm{\C/T}$   or T/T genotype compared with patients with GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR  $+243\;\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{C}$   genotype (  $40.6\%$    vs .  

$25.5\%)$  ; GCH1   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR   $+243\mathrm{~C/T}$   or   $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotype was  associated with an increased risk of death and vascular  events compared to GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $+243\mathrm{~C}/\mathrm{C}$   genotype  even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, plasma TC and  hsCRP level, history of hypertension, diabetes and  smoking (  $.O R{=}2.171$  ,   $95\%\mathrm{CI}$  : 1.066–4.424,   $\scriptstyle P=0.033$  ).  These data suggested that GCH1  $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant was an  independent predictor of worsening outcomes in patients  with first-onset ischemic stroke.

# 3 DISCUSSION  

The present study demonstrated that first-onset  ischemic stroke patients with GCH1  $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $+243\;\mathrm{C/T}$   or   $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotype had significantly more deaths or vascular  events during 5-year follow-up compared with patients  with GCH 3'-UTR   $+243$   CC genotype   $(40.6\%$    vs    $25.5\%$  .  GCH 1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant was associated with the  worsening outcome in patients with first-onset ischemic  stroke even after adjustment for other risk factors  (  $.O R{=}2.171$  ,   $95\%$   CI:   $1.066{-}4.424$  ,   $P{=}0.033^{\circ}$  ). These data  indicated that GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$  variant was an  independent predictor of long-term outcome in patients  with first-onset ischemic stroke.  

GCH1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 biosynthesis, which is an essential cofactor for 3 NOS isoforms . Studies  in vitro  and  in vivo  demonstrated that  GCH1 activation and subsequent BH4 formation were  accompanied by increased NOS activity . Zhang L and  his colleagues founded a novel GCH1 variant located in  the   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR, GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant, which was  associated with decreased NO excretion in urine and  increased blood pressure and heart rate . Furthermore,  functional study demonstrated that GCH1   $_{3^{\prime}}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$  decreased luciferase reporter expression in  trans fec ted 3'-UTRs plasmids. These data indicated that  GCH1   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant might be involved in the  vascular diseases via mediation of the three NOS isoforms.  

Previous studies had shown that three NOS isoforms  played diverse roles in cerebral ischemia . NO derived by  eNOS has a number of protective roles in cerebro vascular  system, which maintains the homeostasis of the cerebro vascular endothelium and preserves cerebral blood  flow to ischemic regions . Furthermore, eNOS is not  only a downstream mediator for vascular endo the li al  growth factor and ang io genesis but also regulates  brain-derived neuro troph ic factor expression in the  ischemic brain and influences progenitor cell proliferation,  neuronal migration, and neurite outgrowth and affects  functional recovery after stroke . In contrast, NO derived  by iNOS and nNOS contributes to the brain injury in  cerebral ischemic reperfusion, in which NO interacts with  superoxide anion to produce per oxy nitrite . Consistent with these principles,  the effects of  NOS inhibitors on infarct size in animal studies demonstrated that  non selective NOS inhibitors did not alter infarct volume  in permanent ischemia, whereas selective iNOS and  nNOS inhibitors reduced lesion size regardless of experimental model . Previous studies had also described  that mice that were deficient of iNOS or nNOS genes  developed smaller infarcts induced by middle cerebral  artery occlusion, whereas eNOS knockout mice produced  larger cerebral infarcts compared with their wild-type  litter mates . These data indicated that 3 NOS isoforms  played different roles in the outcome of ischemic stroke,  including acute and long-term outcome.  

Our study demonstrated that GCH1 3'-UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant, which was associated the GCH1 activity and subsequent NO production , predicted a worsening long-term outcome in patients with ischemic stroke.  Because previous studies demonstrated that iNOS activity was significantly enhanced at the 24-hour point,  which started to decline at the 48-hour point in rodent  middle cerebral artery occlusion models , and the patients in our study were recruited after acute period, the  effect of GCH1 3'-UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant on predicting  worsening long-term outcome might be attributed to its  influence on eNOS. GCH1 gene transfer could augment  intracellular BH4 in human endo the li al cells, accompanied by increased eNOS-dependent NO production .  GCH1 3'-UTR   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant could result in deficient  BH4 and decreased NO production. The regulation of  NO production by eNOS is complex, which has the ability to produce both NO as well as superoxide anion dependent of the availability of the essential cofactor   $\mathrm{\bf\dot{B}H4^{[19]}}$  . Insufficiency of BH4 would cause an uncoupling of the  $L$  -arginine-NO pathway, which results in the  formation of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite instead of   $\mathrm{NO}^{[2]}$  . Reduced BH4 has been  shown to be involved in the vascular diseases. Therefore,  GCH1  $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant would become an important predictor of death and new vascular events in patients with  ischemic stroke.  

A large number of studies demonstrated the vascular benefits of exogenous BH4, which were based on  examining endothelium-dependent va so dilation. BH4  improved endo the li al function in patients with diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , coronary artery diseases , and those who smoke  or with  chronic alcohol consumption , which could promote  the therapeutic potential for BH4 treatment of vascular  diseases. A potential disadvantage of BH4 treatment is  that BH4 might stimulate neuronal and inducible NOS,  leading to excessive NO production and toxicity, particularly in cerebral ischemic reperfusion injuries ,  which limited the application of BH4 supplement. However, the patients with stroke during the recovery period  could benefit from BH4 supplement through modulating  the eNOS. Our study showed that GCH1  $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant  predicted worsening long-term outcome in patients with  first-onset ischemic stroke, which indicated that stroke  patients with GCH1   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$  might benefit from BH4  supplement during the recovery period.  

In summary, GCH1   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant, which was  associated with GCH1 activity and NO production, was  an independent predictor of worsening long-term outcome in patients with first-onset ischemic stroke. BH4  supplement might be applied in stroke patients with  GCH1   $\mathrm{C}{+}243\mathrm{T}$   variant during the recovery period,  which need be further tested through clinical trials.
