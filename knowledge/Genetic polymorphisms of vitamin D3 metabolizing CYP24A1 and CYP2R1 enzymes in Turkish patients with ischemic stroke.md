# ABSTRACT  

Objective:   Vitamin D deficiency is known as an important risk factor in pathogen es is of  atherosclerosis, which contributes to stroke development. Genetic variations including  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism can  affect susceptibility to the development of stroke. Therefore, the objective of this study was  to investigate the association between polymorphisms of vitamin D metabolizing enzymes  (rs927650 SNP in  CYP24A1,  and rs10741657 SNP in  CYP2R1  genes,) and ischemic stroke risk in  Turkish population.

# KEYWORDS  

CYP24A1; CYP2R1; single  nucleotide polymorphism;  vitamin D; ischemic stroke Materials and methods:   To test this hypothesis, we designed a case-control study which  consisted of 256 ischemic stroke patients and 132 controls. Genotypes were determined by PCRRFLP technique.  

Results:   No significant differences were found between patients and controls in terms  of CYP24A1 rs927650 and CYP2R1 rs10741657 genotype frequencies. Polymorphic allele  frequencies of CYP24A1 rs927650 and CYP2R1 rs10741657 were 0.414 and 0.660 in stroke  patients, respectively.  

Conclusion:  This is the first study conducted regarding the association of CYP24A1 rs927650  and CYP2R1 rs10741657 genetic polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk. The polymorphic  genotypes of these polymorphisms, together with hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and  obesity, were found as significant risk factors for ischemic stroke.  

# Introduction  

Stroke, a serious and life-threatening neurological medical condition, also known as brain attack, occurs when  the blood flow to an area of the brain is interrupted or  reduced which is generally caused by a clot or blood  vessel that bursts or leaks. There are lots of risk factors  for the development of stroke such as, age, gender, obesity, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,  atherosclerosis, and dys lipid emi as.  

Vitamin D is one of the oldest steroid hormones  including the principal circulatory form 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH-D3) and the hormonal form, 1,25-dihyd roxy vitamin D (1α-25-(OH)2D3) [ 1 ]. The best known  function of vitamin D is in bone and calcium metabolism. Apart from this well-documented role, vitamin D  has been identified as an important factor in cardiovascular health [ 2 ]. Kendrick et al. (2009) and Durup et al.  (2015) have reported that vitamin D deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease events [ 3 , 4 ]. Vitamin  D has a direct role in systemic inflammatory process  [ 5 , 6 ]. Endo the li al cells (EC) have vitamin D receptors  and express 1α-hydroxyl as e to produce   $1\upalpha,25(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\mathrm{D}_{3}$    [ 7 ]. Besides, vitamin D takes part in an inflammatory  process by applying protective effects on endo the li al  activation and dysfunction. Decrease in nitric oxide  (NO) and increase in oxidative stress are the main contributors to endo the li al d is functioning [ 8 ]. It has been  revealed that vitamin D stimulates NO synthesis [ 9 ] and  also reduces oxidative stress in endothelium by suppressing the superoxide synthesis [ 10 ]. Vascular tone is  also regulated by vitamin D by modulating discharge of  endothelium derived contracting factors [ 6 ] and vitamin  D prevents the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle  cells by inhibiting release of epidermal growth factor  and endothelin. Moreover, vitamin D has an effect on  regulation of coagulation process through up regulating  the expression of the anticoagulant and down regulating the expression of a critical coagulation factors in  monocytes [ 11 ].  

Some researchers reported that vitamin D deficiency  triggers hypertension, heart attack, diabetes, and athero sclerosis [ 2 , 12 , 13 ]. With all these evidence, vitamin  D deficiency is appearing as a risk factor for stroke  among the other risk factors like hypertension, smoking, hyper lipid emi a, obesity, age, and gender. CYP24A1  and CYP2R1, important cytochrome P450 enzymes,  expressed in the kidney and liver, respectively, are known  to take role in vitamin D metabolism. CYP2R1 takes role  in the biological activation process of vitamin D; on the  other hand, CYP24A1 carries out the degradation of vitamin D [ 14 ]. Genetic variation in the genes which express  CYP24A1 and CYP2R1 enzymes can change the enzyme  activity in the organism. So, concentration of vitamin D  can vary depending on the effect of these variations on  the gene. The level of vitamin D has been reported as an  important parameter for stroke risk and severity [ 12 , 15 ].  

Approximately 50 polymorphisms of  CYP24A1  gene  were identified up to now. Jones et al. (2012) reported  that four polymorphisms are associated with lower  concentrations of vitamin D [ 16 ]. It was shown that  CYP24A1  promoter region SNP reduces the expression  of  CYP24A1  in human lymphocytes cell culture [ 17 ].  The relationship between polymorphism and reduction  of CYP24A1 enzyme activity was also shown by Jacobs   et al. (2013) with the study of vitamin D metabolism and  cancer cells [ 18 ]. Studies showed that CYP2R1 enzyme  has been related with the vitamin D deficiency [ 19–22 ].  CYP2R1 rs10741657 polymorphism affects vitamin D  level and it has been associated with lower 25(OH)D3  synthesis [ 23 ]. Ramos-Lopez et al. (2007) reported that  CYP2R1 rs10741657 polymorphism of GG or GA gen- otyped patients have lower levels of   $25(\mathrm{OH})\mathrm{D}3$   when  compared to AA genotyped patients [ 24 ]. Similar results  were obtained from study conducted by Hassanein   et al. (2014) [ 25 ]. They were also reported that low level  of 25(OH)D3 was found in GG or GA genotyped individuals [ 25 ].  

In the present study, rs927650 polymorphism in  CYP24A1  gene and rs10741657 polymorphism in  CYP2R1  gene were investigated for the risk of ischemic  stroke. To our current knowledge, this is the first study  concerning the association of genetic polymorphisms  of CYP24A1 and CYP2R1 enzymes and the risk of  ischemic stroke susceptibility.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study population  

The study population was comprised of 256 consecutive  unrelated adult Caucasian acute hemispheric ischemic  stroke patients from central Anatolia (Turkey) and  132 symptom-free Caucasian controls from the same  geographic region. Informed consent was obtained  from all participants before study entry. Cases were  selected among patients suffering stroke admitted to the  neurology services of Gülhane Military Medical Faculty,  Ankara, within 24 hours after onset. These patients had  an anterior circulation stroke resulted from carotid  artery at hero sclerotic disease. The cerebral infarction  was initially diagnosed on the basis of neurological  examination and brain computer tomography (CT)  scan and then trans thoracic echo car dio graphic examination, Holter study, and Trans cranial Doppler emboli  detection procedure to rule out emboli source. In order  to be considered eligible, the patients should meet following criteria: having anterior circulation stroke, no  other major illnesses, including autoimmune diseases,  neoplasms, coa gulo p athies, hepatic, or renal failure, no  known embolic source (aortic arch, cardiac, or carotid),  no family history of hematological, autoimmune, or  chronic inflammatory diseases, no history of myocardial infarction within 3 weeks or of transient ischemic  attack or stroke at any time. The details of the inclusion  and exclusion criteria were as described before [ 26 ]. The  study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the  Gülhane Medical Academy and was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.  Our classification system is similar to the Trial of ORG  10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST). We included  TOAST ‘Large-vessel disease’ group and Oxfordshire  Community Stroke Project (OCSP) ‘total anterior’ and  ‘partial anterior circulation infarcts’ groups into the  study. Control subjects were selected randomly from  neurology outpatient clinics and did not have stroke or  transient ischemic attack at any time. All exclusion criteria were applied to the controls exactly, plus not having  carotid stenosis (lumen narrowing)>   $70\%$   or ulcerated  carotid plaque.  

# Genotype determination  

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood  leukocytes by salt extraction [ 27 ] and stored at   $-20\ \ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  till use. Standard PCR protocols, followed  by restriction enzyme digestions, were used to genotype the  CYP24A1  gene (rs927650) and  CYP2R1   gene (rs10741657) polymorphisms. The primer pairs  used for PCR amplification of the CYP24A1 rs927650  SNP  were   $5^{\prime}$  -GG GAA GAG CA AT GAC AT GG A $.3^{\prime}$    and   $5^{\prime}$  -GCC CT GG A AG ACT CAT TTT G $.3^{\prime}$  and  those for the CYP2R1 rs10741657 SNP were   $5^{\prime}$    TG GT TG CAT A A CACA AAC CTA 3 ′   and   $5^{\prime}$    CT GAA A GCC AGT AAC A AT G GT 3 ′ . For the amplification of both CYP24A1 rs927650 SNP and CYP2R1  rs10741657 SNP regions PCR mixture in a total volume  of  $50\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   contained  $200\,\mathrm{ng}$   genomic DNA,  $200\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$   dNTPs,  30 pmol of each primer,   $1.5\,\mathrm{{mM}\,\mathrm{{MgCl}}_{2}}$   and  $2.5\,\mathrm{U}$   of Taq  , polymerase and the PCR conditions consisted of an initial melting temperature of  $94\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 2 minutes followed  by 35 cycles of melting   $(94\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C},30$   seconds), annealing  (  ${}^{60}\,{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$   30 seconds), and extension (  $.72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$   1 minutes).  A final extension step (  $72\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  , 3 minutes) terminates the  reaction. Genotyping for CYP24A1 rs927650 polymorphism involved digestion of PCR products with   $_{2\mathrm{~U~}}$  Bg1 II at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 18 hours. For the CYP2R1 rs10741657  polymorphism, PCR products were digested with 2U   $M n\mathrm{II}$   at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 18 hours. All of the digestion products  were visualized by electrophoresis on a  $3\%$   agarose gel.  

# Statistical analyses  

Continuous variables were expressed as mean   $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$  .  Normality of the sample distribution of each continuous variable was tested with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov  test. Differences of continuous variables were evaluated  by the independent samples t or Mann–Whitney   $U$   test.  Categorical variables were expressed as proportions and  compared using   $\chi^{2}$   test. Allele distributions were compared using  $\chi^{2}$   test. The associations of the effects of vascular risk factors, genotypes in ischemic stroke cases, and  controls were assessed by odds ratios (ORs) and  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs). The OR and CI were calculated  using logistic regression analysis with backward selection  method.  $P$   values  $<0.05$   were considered statistically significant. These statistical analyses were performed with  SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  

# Results  

Table  1  presents the clinical laboratory test results and  some risk factors of ischemic stroke patients and controls. The age and sex status of patients and controls  were not significantly different. The prevalence of risk  factors for stroke such as hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and levels of total cholesterol,  triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol were found to be  higher in patient group than control group. On the other  hand, HDL-cholesterol level was significantly lower in  ischemic stroke patients   $(1.1\pm0.3\,\mathrm{{mm}/\mathrm{{L})}}$  ) when com- pared to the control group   $(1.2\pm0.3\,\mathrm{{mm}/\mathrm{{L}}},P<0.01)$  ).  

There was no statistically significant difference  in distribution of CYP24A1 rs927650 and CYP2R1  rs10741657 genotypes and allele frequencies in ischemic  stroke patients and controls (Table  2 ).  

In Table  3 , genotype data were stratified into hypertensive/nor moten sive, diabetic/non-diabetic, smoker/ non-smoker, and obese/non-obese subgroups. While  making comparison between the genotypes of CYP24A1  rs927650, the CT and TT were attributed as a single  group. Thus,   $\mathrm{CT+TT}$   were compared against the wild  type genotype (CC). Similar practice was applied for  CYP2R1 rs10741657 genotypes;  $\mathrm{AC}+\mathrm{CG}$   were taken as  a single group and compared against the wild type (AA).  

In CYP24A1 polymorphism CC wild-type genotype  group, the proportion of stroke patients to controls  was found to be higher in the hypertensive, diabetic,  smoker, and obese groups than the respective normotensive, non-diabetic, non-smoker, and non-obese  group. For CYP24A1 CC and   $\mathrm{CT+TT}$  genotypes, the  risk of having stroke is 3.6 times and 3.1 times higher  (  $\textstyle P<0.01$  ,   $P<0.01$  ) in hypertensive s when compared to  nor moten s ives, respectively. As a result, the risk of having stroke increases with hypertension for all genotypes  of CYP24A1 rs927650 polymorphism. In diabetics and  smokers group,  $\mathrm{CT+TT}$   risky genotype had 2.4-fold and  3.7-fold increased risk for stroke, respectively   $(P<0.01\$  ,   $P<0.01$  ). The risk ratio increased up to 4.1 in obese  group when compared to non-obese group   $\left(P<0.01\right)$  ).  

When Table  3  was examined in terms of CYP2R1  rs10741657 AG   $^+$   GG genotyped individuals, the risk  of having stroke was 3.4 times higher in hypertensive s  when compared to nor moten s ives   $\left(P<0.01\right)$  ). In diabetics,   $\mathrm{BG+BG}$   genotype had 2.8-fold increased risk for  ischemic stroke (  $(P<0.01)$  ). As can be seen in Table  3 ,   $\mathrm{AC}+\mathrm{CG}$   genotype (  $(\mathrm{OR}=2.226$  ,  $P=0.01$  ) was found to  be a significant risk factor of stroke in smokers. Among  obese subjects, for  $\mathrm{AC}+\mathrm{CG}$   genotype, the risk of having  stroke was 4.8 times higher than for non-obese subjects   $\left(P<0.01\right)$  .  

Logistic regression analysis with backward likelihood  method was used to determine the effects of vascular  risk factors, lipid parameters, and CYP24A1 rs927650  and CYP2R1 rs10741657 genotypes in the prediction  of ischemic stroke and the results are given in Table  4 .  Age, sex, hypertension, smoking status, diabetes, obesity, lipid parameters (total cholesterol, triglycerides,

The analysis showed that hypertension   $(\mathrm{OR}=3.387$  ,   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}=2.095–5.475$  ,  $P<0.01]$  ),  smoking   $(\mathrm{OR}=3.074$  ,  $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}=1.598–5.915,$   $P<0.01$  ),  obesity (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=2.730$  ,   $95\%$   $5\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=1.211{-}6.155,$   $P=0.015$  ),  and LDL-cholesterol (  $\mathrm{OR}=1.397$  ,  $95\%\,{\mathrm{CI}}=1.086{-}1.796$     $P<0.01\rangle$  ) were the significant determinants of ischemic  stroke. However, HDL- cholesterol   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.276$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.119–0.640$  ,   $P<0.01$  ) served as preventive factor  for stroke. The model predicted   $71.1\%$   of cases correctly  and the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit test pointed  out that the calibration of the model was satisfactory   $(\chi^{2}=7.237;8$   degrees of freedom;   $P=0.511$  ).

# Discussion  

In this study, the relationship between vitamin D metabolizing enzymes CYP24A1 rs927650 and CYP2R1  rs10741657 genetic polymorphisms and risk of ischemic  stroke was investigated. Stroke is the term employed to  describe the acute neurological and irreversible manifestations of cerebro vascular disease which results from  interruptions to blood flow in the brain and is the second  leading cause of death in the world. Atherosclerosis is a  progressive disease characterized by the accumulation of  cholesterol deposits in arteries and is an important risk  factor for stroke [ 28 ]. Oxidative stress, which has a pivotal role in the pathogen es is of at hero sclerotic process,  is a condition occurring when the physiological balance  between oxidants and antioxidants is disrupted. So, oxidative stress and atherosclerosis are the most important  risk factors for stroke development. Vitamin D deficiency  promotes atheroma formation and vitamin D supplementation prevents the vascular risk and low levels of  25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D3) are associated with  peripheral artery disease [ 29 , 30 ]. In addition, Carvalho  and Sposito (2015) reported that vitamin D may prevent oxidative stress in endo the li al cells and reduces  the expression of apoptosis-related genes [ 29 ]. Also  vitamin D modulates the expression of oxidative stress  and at hero genesis regulatory proteins [ 31 ]. Vitamin D  deficiency has been found to trigger hypertension, heart  attack [ 12 ] and also cardiovascular-related diseases [ 32 ],  like diabetes [ 13 ], heart failure [ 33 ], atherosclerosis [ 2 ],  peripheral vascular disease and pathological state of the  endothelium [ 34 ] and many studies reported that lowlevel vitamin D increases stroke severity and stroke risk  [ 12 , 15 ]. Therefore, understanding the effect of polymorphisms of vitamin D metabolizing enzymes in ischemic  stroke risk is of crucial importance.  

The cytochrome P450s (CYP450) are a large superfamily of phase I enzymes. Actually, all organisms from  bacteria to humans and plants can have them. The  cytochrome P450 enzymes are mono ox gen as es and generally introduce oxygen, usually in the form of a hydroxyl  group, to the substrate. In addition to hydroxyl ation,  the CYP450 enzymes are able to perform other reactions such as de alkyl ation, carbon-carbon bond cleavage, de hydrogenation, and epoxidation [ 35 ]. They are  responsible for the oxidative metabolism of endogenous  and exogenous compounds because of this role they act  as a body’s defense system against xenobiotic exposure  [ 36 ]. CYP450 enzymes take role in generation of epoxye i cos at rien oic acids (EETs), important regulators of  coronary circulation. In addition, they catalyze the oxidation of low density lipoprotein in liver and arterial  walls that is important in at hero genesis [ 37 ]. Because  of these properties, there are some association studies  related with the CYP450 enzyme polymorphisms and  ischemic stroke risk in the literature [ 26,38–40 ]. We  have previously shown that in Turkish population variants of CYP1A1 gene were significantly related with  the risk of ischemic stroke, especially in subgroups [ 40 ].  According to results of our other study, the minor allele  of   $\mathrm{CY}\mathrm{P}2\mathrm{E}1^{*}5\mathrm{B}$   polymorphism increases the risk of having stroke 8-times compared to wild type allele [ 26 ].  

Catabolism and hydroxyl ation of vitamin D is carried out by CYP24A1 and CYP2R1 enzymes, respectively [ 14 ]. Change in normal activity of the enzymes  taking part in activation or in activation of vitamin D  can affect the risk of having stroke. It was shown that  diabetic individuals having G allele for the rs10741657  polymorphism of CYP2R1 had lower level of 25-OH-D3  concentration than AA genotyped individuals [ 24 ]. It  was also shown that individuals with AA genotype had  higher concentration of 25-OH-D3 than AG and GG  genotyped individuals [ 25 ].  

In the present study, there was no significant difference between patients and controls with respect to genotype distribution of CYP24A1 rs927650 and CYP2R1  rs10741657 polymorphisms (Table  2 ). Therefore, these  SNPs of CYP24A1 and CYP2R1 cannot be considered as independent risk factors for ischemic stroke in  Turkish population. There is no study to evaluate effect  of CYP24A1 and CYP2R1 polymorphism on ischemic  stroke risk in the literature. However, the association  between vitamin D status and cardiovascular risk have  been investigated and found that vitamin D deficiency  is associated with the cardiovascular disease in some  small cross-sectional studies [ 12 , 13 , 32 ]. The connection  between vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular disease was explained by several mechanisms in a number  of studies conducted. The study of Li et al. (2002) showed  that direct involvement of   $1{-}25(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\mathrm{D}_{3}$   in suppression  of renin gene provides the regulation of renin–angiotensin system directly suppressing renin gene expression  [ 41 ]. Disruption in renin–angiotensin system affects  development of heart diseases [ 42 ]. Modulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, smooth muscle cell  proliferation, inflammation, and thrombosis can be  included to the functions and physiological actions of  vitamin D. The study of Kasuga et al. (2002) indicated  that over expression of 24-hydro xl yas e (CYP24A1), taking part in catabolism of   $\begin{array}{r}{1–25(\mathrm{OH})_{2}–\mathrm{D}_{3},}\end{array}$   increases the  risk of atherosclerosis [ 43 ]. Transgenic rats generated  for the study were constitutive ly expressing CYP24A1.  

At hero sclerotic lesions were examined in aorta of rats  which were either fed normal diet or high fat diet [ 43 ].  Besides, Hassanein et al. (2014) observed that patients  with coronary heart disease had significantly lower level  of  $25\mathrm{-OH}\mathrm{-D}_{3}$   when compared to control group without  coronary artery disease [ 25 ]. The study also revealed an  association between rs10741657 SNP of  CYP2R1  gene  and coronary artery disease incidence [ 25 ]. The association of the CYP2R1 rs10741657 SNP with coronary  artery disease incidence was found in individuals having  the G variant in their genotypes. Also, individuals with  AA genotype had higher concentration of 25-OH-D3  than AG and GG genotyped individuals [ 25 ]. So, it can  be concluded that the polymorphisms in CYP24A1 and  CYP2R1 also increase the incidence of coronary artery  disease due to decreased level of vitamin D.  

The study population was grouped under hypertensive/nor moten sive, diabetic/non-diabetic, smoker/nonsmoker, and obese/non-obese subgroups to analyze the  effect of hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, and  obesity together with CYP24A1 rs927650 and CYP2R1  rs10741657 genotypes on the risk of ischemic stroke  (Table  3 ). The risk of having stroke in hypertensive  individuals was threefold higher than nor moten s ives  within the   $\mathrm{CT\mathrm{~+~}T T}$   genotype of CYP24A1 rs927650  polymorphism group. The individuals carrying wild  type CC genotype have 3.6-fold increased risk of having  hypertension-related ischemic stroke when compared to  nor moten s ives. CYP24A1 has been clearly established  as the main enzyme responsible for the degradation of  active vitamin D. Tarcin et al. (2009) reported that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased prevalence  of hypertension and endo the li al dysfunction in healthy  subjects [ 44 ]. Polymorphic enzyme may enhance the  degradation of active vitamin D and decreased level of  vitamin D may increase the risk of stroke development  together with hypertension.  

In the study of Mauf et al. (2015), association between  the lower level of vitamin D and incidence of type 1  diabetes (T1D) was examined [ 45 ]. T1D is a chronic  autoimmune disease which is mainly carried out by  immunogen ic dendritic cells [ 46 ]. It was suggested  increased plasma levels of   $25\mathrm{-OH}\mathrm{-D}_{3}$   may inhibit  formation of dendritic cell (DC) and increase immuno modulator y cells so decrease incidence of T1D.  So,   $25\mathrm{-OH}\mathrm{-D}_{3}$   shows immuno modulator y effects at  the cellular level in patients with T1D. For CYP24A1  rs927650 polymorphism, when compared to TT genotyped individuals, individuals with CC genotype showed  a significantly higher increase of immuno modulator y  cells [ 45 ]. Individuals with TT genotype in CYP24A1  rs927650 SNP had an increased frequency of mature  dendritic cells, which increase the risk of T1D. Besides,  the maturation of DCs is disrupted in the presence of   $\mathrm{1-25(OH)}_{2}\mathrm{D}_{3}$   [ 47 ] and also   $\mathrm{1-25(OH)}_{2}\mathrm{D}_{3}$   treatment  has been shown to induce apoptosis of mature DCs  [ 48 ]. According to our results; in diabetics,   $\mathrm{CT\mathrm{~+~}T T}$    genotypes significantly increase the risk of stroke 2.4- fold when compared to non-diabetics. Smokers with   $\mathrm{CT+TT}$   risky genotype had 3.7-fold higher risk than  non-smokers with   $\mathrm{CT+TT}$   risky genotype. Similarly,  we observed that   $\mathrm{CT+TT}$   genotyped obese group had  4-fold higher risk for ischemic stroke.  

When Table  3  was examined for CYP2R1 rs10741657  polymorphism   $\mathrm{AC}+\mathrm{CG}$   genotype group was found to  be significant risk factor for ischemic stroke in all subgroups like hypertensive s, smokers, diabetics, and obese.  For CYP2R1, two different studies showed the association of the G variant of the rs10741657 SNP with type 1  diabetes [ 20 , 24 ]. Moreover, the study of Ramos-Lopez  et al. (2007) demonstrated that individuals having G  allele had lower level of 25-OH-D3 concentration than  AA genotyped individuals [ 24 ]. Also, the other studies  have revealed the association of the CYP2R1 rs10741657  SNP with incidence of pancreatic cancer [ 49 ] as well as  hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma [ 50 ].  

Logistic regression analysis confirmed hypertension,  smoking, obesity, and LDL-cholesterol as significant risk  factors for stroke, while HDL-cholesterol as significant  protective factor against ischemic stroke. Similar results  were obtained from our previous studies [ 26 , 40 ].  

Limitations of the present study include number of  control subjects. However, it should be noted that the  sample was clinically well defined and strictly selected  so as to keep mean age of controls and stroke patients  similar, as age is the strongest determinant of stroke. It  was highly difficult to find elderly subjects who meet the  required criteria as controls, i.e. no history of ischemic  stroke, transient ischemic attack, and ischemic heart dis- ease at any time or myocardial infarction within 3 weeks  and no more than  $70\%$   carotid stenosis. Confirmation  of these results requires further studies involving larger  populations. Nevertheless, statistical tests showed that  our sample size was enough to obtain reliable statistical  results.  

# Conclusion  

In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the  first study to evaluate the possible association between  the polymorphisms of vitamin D metabolizing enzymes,  CYP24A1 rs927650 and CYP2R1 rs10741657, and  ischemic stroke risk. These polymorphisms had no  role in the development of ischemic stroke in the studied Turkish population. But, significant results were  obtained in hypertensive, smoker, diabetic, and obese  individuals carrying the variant allele.
