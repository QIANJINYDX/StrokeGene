# ABSTRACT  

Recently, a novel locus at chromosome 6p25 (rs12204590, near  FOXF2 )  associated with an increased risk of stroke in European populations was identified.  However, whether polymorphisms in  FOXF2  are also associated with the incidence  of ischemic stroke in other populations remains unknown. In this case-control study,  803 Chinese Han patients with ischemic stroke and 803 matched control individuals  were enrolled. Four tag SNPs and rs12204590 located in or near  FOXF2  were selected,  and the associations between genotypes/alleles and ischemic stroke were analyzed.  In our study, we did not detect an association between the previously reported locus  rs12204590 and ischemic stroke. By the genotype analysis, a novel SNP rs1711972,  near  FOXF2 , was observed to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic  stroke(CA genotype, adjusted  ${\bf\Omega}^{\mathsf{O R}}={\bf1}.{\bf35};$  ;   $\bf{95\%}$   CI, 1.07 to 1.70), but not significantly  after Bonferroni corrections for multiple tests. However, in the subgroup analysis,  we discovered that rs1711972 was associated with an increased risk of large-artery  at hero sclerotic stroke in the additive model   $\scriptstyle(P\;=\;0.020;$   CA genotype, adjusted   ${\boldsymbol{\mathsf{O R}}}=1.50;\,95\%{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{C I}}},$   1.09 to 2.07) and dominant model (  $\pmb{\mathscr{P}}=\pmb{0.010};$     ${\bf O R}={\bf1.47}$  ;  $\scriptstyle{\mathfrak{g}}_{5}\%\mathtt{c}\mathtt{I},$    1.09 to 1.99). Collectively, these results indicate that a novel SNP near  FOXF2  may  influence the risk of large-artery at hero sclerotic stroke in Chinese Han population.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is the leading neurological cause of death and  long-term disability worldwide [1, 2]. In China, millions of  people suffer from stroke, and there are approximately 2.5  million new cases of patients with stroke and 7.5 million  stroke survivors each year [3, 4]. Although the various risk  factors underlying this critical pathological condition have  been identified in different geographic regions [5, 6], the  genetic background has been proposed as a possible cause  and promoting factor for the occurrence of irregularity in the  risk of stroke among ethnic populations [7]. Therefore, the  other genetic loci that are associated with the susceptibility  to stroke should be identified in these populations.  

Risk loci associated with stroke and its subtypes  have been identified in several genes [8, 9] such as  ,  

PITX2 ,  ZFHX3 ,  HDAC9 ,  NINJ2 ,  ABO ,  APOE  and  PMF1  [3, 10–17]. Recently, a novel locus at chromosome  6p25 (rs12204590, near  FOXF2 ) has been observed  to be associated with an increased risk of stroke in  European populations [18]. The  FOXF2  gene is located  in chromosome 6p25.3. It has been revealed that  chromosome 6p25.3 is associated with an increase in the  appearance of white matter hyper intensities in the general  population [18]. FOXF2 is first expressed in the neural  crest cells, and in mice, it regulates the pathways that are  involved in the differentiation of mural cells (pericytes  and vascular smooth muscle cells), including the PDGF $\cdot\upbeta$    and serum response factor pathways [19]. FOXF2 is also  required for the development of the blood-brain barrier  [20]. The conditional deletion of FOXF2 in adult mice led  to the development of cerebral infarction, reactive gliosis,  and cerebral micro hemorrhage [18]. Patients with rare  segmental deletions of FOXF2 also exhibited an increased  appearance of white matter hyper intensities. As large-artery  at hero sclerotic (LAA) stroke and small-vessel disease  (SVD)-related stroke are the most pervasive subtypes in  the Chinese Han population [21], and increasing evidence  has revealed that the genetic risks vary depending on the  subtypes of ischemic stroke [22], it is important to determine  whether the variants in or near  FOXF2  are associated with  the increased risk of ischemic stroke and its subtypes.  

To investigate the possible role of rs12204590 and  other new loci in or near  FOXF2  that are associated with  ischemic stroke, a case-control study of 803 cases and 803  controls was performed.  

# RESULTS  

# Clinical characteristics  

As shown in Table 1, there was no significant  difference in gender   $(P=0.166)$  ) and age   $(P=0.057)$  )  between the patients and controls. The results for the  prevalence of hyper lipid emi a   $\left(P=0.583\right)$  ) and smoking   $(P\,=\,0.124)$  ) were also similar. Conversely, there was  a significant deviation with respect to the history of  hypertension   $(P\,<\,0.01)$  ) and diabetes mellitus (DM)   $(P<0.01)$   revealed between the patient and control groups.  In the subsequent analyses, therefore these confounding  factors (age, sex, hypertension, DM, hyper lipid emi a, and  smoking) were adjusted for to estimate the effect of these  SNPs on the susceptibility to ischemic stroke.  

# Association of SNP with ischemic stroke  

All the selected SNPs were in Hardy–Weinberg  equilibrium   $(P>0.05)$   in the control group (Table 2). The  univariate analysis indicated that there were significant  differences in allelic frequencies of the rs  $1711972\,\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{C}$  polymorphism between the groups (  $\textstyle P=0.014$  ;  $\mathrm{OR}=1.22$  ;   $95\%$   CI, 1.04 to 1.42). The dominant-effect model also  indicated that the rs1711972 locus was associated  with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (CC/CA vs.  AA,   $P=0.011$  ;   $\mathrm{OR}=1.34$  ;   $95\%$   CI, 1.07 to 1.67). The  frequencies of the AA, CA and CC genotypes in the  patients were   $50.44\%$  ,  $41.72\%$  , and   $7.85\%$   respectively,  and in the controls, their frequencies were   $56.78\%$  ,   $36.81\%$  , and   $6.41\%$   respectively (Table 3). The CA  genotype of rs1711972 remained associated with an  increased risk of ischemic stroke in the additive model   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.35$  ;  $95\%$   CI, 1.07 to 1.70); However, there was  no significant association after the correction for multiple  tests   $(P^{\mathrm{corr}}~=~0.019)$  ). According to the Hosmer-Leme  show goodness-of-fit test, this model was well calibrated  (  $P=0.700$   for rs1711972). The other four selected SNPs  showed no detectable association with ischemic stroke in  this study.  

# Subgroup analysis  

To explore the effect of SNPs on the risk of the  subtypes of stroke, the subjects were stratified by the  TOAST subtypes. As shown in Table 4, the univariate  analyses revealed significant deviations in the genotype  frequencies of rs1711972 between the patients with LAA  stroke and the healthy controls   $\left.P=0.020\right\}$  ). Multivariate  logistic regression analysis, which was adjusted for the  aforementioned confounding factors, demonstrated that  the CA genotype of rs1711972 remained associated with  the increased risk of LAA stroke   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.50$  ;   $95\%$   CI,  1.09 to 2.07). The frequencies of the AA, CA, and CC  genotypes were   $47.67\%$  ,  $42.79\%$  , and  $9.54\%$   respectively,  in the patients, and   $57.21\%$  ,   $34.88\%$  , and   $7.91\%$  ,  respectively, in the controls. A significant association  with the increased risk of LAA stroke remained for  the CA genotype after the correction for multiple tests   $(P^{\mathrm{corr}}=0.008)$  ).   $P=\,0.010$   for the allelic distribution of  rs 1711972 and   $P\,=\,0.033$   for that of rs41300825 in  association with LAA stroke. The dominant-effect  model revealed that the rs1711972 locus (CC/CA vs.  AA,  $P=0.010$  ;   $\mathrm{OR}=1.47$  ;   $95\%$   CI, 1.09 to 1.99) was  associated with the increased risk of LAA stroke, and the  rs41300825 locus (CC/CG vs. GG,  $P=0.038$  ;  $\mathrm{OR}=0.68$  ;   $95\%$   CI, 0.47 to 0.98) was associated with a decreased  risk of LAA stroke. The results of the Hosmer-Leme  show goodness-of-fit test were   $P=0.176$   for rs1711972,  and  $P=0.105$   for rs41300825. As shown in Table 5, no  association between the involved SNPs and the risk of  SVD stroke was detected.  

# Haplotype and LD analyses  

The LD analysis revealed a block of LD, including  three SNPs, rs41300825, rs732835, and rs910023   $\mathrm{R}^{2}$   $\,=\,0.831$  ) (Supplementary Figure 1). In the haplotype  analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, DM,  hyper lipid emi a and smoking, none of the Haplotypes were  observed to be associated with stroke (Table 6).  

# MDR for SNP–SNP interactions  

The effect of the interaction between the selected  SNPs on the risk of ischemic stroke was analyzed by  MDR. As shown in Table 7, in the single-locus model,  rs1711972 was the most probable contributing factor  to susceptibility to ischemic stroke (testing accuracy   $=$  0.5318,   $\mathrm{CVC}=10/10$  ,  $P=0.420$  ); However, the results  were not significant.  

# DISCUSSION  

In this study, we identified a novel SNP, rs1711972,  which was associated with the susceptibility to LAA  stroke using the additive model, dominant model, and

allelic analyses. This is the first study to investigate the  relationship between the SNPs in  FOXF2  and ischemic  stroke in Chinese Han population.  

FOXF2  is located on chromosome 6p25.3,  and consists of two exons and one intron spanning  approximately   ${5}{-6}\mathrm{~\textmu~}$   [18]. This gene encodes a  forkhead box transcription factor, which is involved in  the regulation of various developmental and biological  processes [23, 24]. Previous studies revealed that  FOXF2  is expressed in neural crest cells, which are progenitors  of cerebro vascular mural cells. Patients with segmental  deletions of this gene showed the extensive, confluent  appearance of white matter hyper intensities, and animal  experiments showed that conditional  FOXF2  mutations  induced the development of cerebral infarction,  micro hemorrhage, and defects in the differentiation  of cerebral vascular mural cells [20, 25]; Recently, a  common variant, rs12204590 near  FOXF2,  was found to  be associated with increased susceptibility to stroke.The  rs1711972 locus is located in the region between  FOXQ1   and  FOXF2 , which contains enhancers and DNaseI  hypersensitive regions. For this reason, we speculate that  rs1711972 may regulate  FOXF2  expression. However, the  significant association of rs12204590 with susceptibility to  SVD stroke in Chinese Han population was not observed,  which appears to conflict with the reports of previous  studies on European populations. The discrepancy may  be attributed to genetic heterogeneity due to geographic  or ethnic distribution and minor variations in the allele  frequencies of  FOXF2  between Chinese and European  populations (rs12204590, frequency of A allele in  Europeans  $=0.1899$  , frequency of A allele in East Asians  $=$    0.0030). The relationship between SNP-SNP interactions  and the risk of ischemic stroke was also analyzed by  MDR. However, no significant interaction among these  five SNPs was observed.  

Our study had several limitations. First, there might  be potential selection bias owing to the hospital-based  study design. Second, the sample size was not particularly  large, and certain positive results might not have been  detected. Furthermore, as there are many factors that have  been revealed to be associated with stroke, the biological  mechanisms of the association between polymorphisms  and susceptibility to ischemic stroke are not clarified yet,

which requires additional  in vitro  and  in vivo  studies in  the future.  

In summary, we identified a novel  FOXF2  SNP  (rs1711972), which may be used as a candidate biomarker  of ischemic stroke and LAA stroke in the Chinese Han  population. Simultaneously, the early detection of SNPs  would greatly contribute to the prevention of ischemic  stroke, particularly LAA stroke. Future studies on  different population groups and well-designed functional  experiments are necessary to verify and extend our findings.

# Selection of SNPs  

The acquisition of SNP data was based on the  HapMap database, and tag SNPs were determined using the  Haploview Software version 4.2(http://www.broad institute. org/haploview/haploview) [26], and selected using the  following filters: (1)   $\mathrm{r}^{2}=0.8$  , (2) minor allele frequency   $(\mathrm{MAF})\geq10~\%$  , (3) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test   $P$    value  $\geq0.05$  . Finally, a total of 5 SNPs were selected for  further investigation: Four were novel tag SNPs (rs1711972,  rs41300825, rs732835, and rs910023), and one was the  recently reported risk locus for stroke (rs12204590).  Table 2 shows the chromosomal location and information  on the population distribution of these SNPs. Linkage  d is equilibrium (LD) between the SNPs was calculated  using the Haploview Software version 4.2, and is included  in Supplementary Figure 1.  

# DNA isolation and genotyping

each subject in an vacutainer tube with EDTA. Genomic  DNA was extracted using a DNA isolation kit, according  to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genotyping was  performed by the improved multiple ligation-detection  reaction (iMLDR), with technical support from the Center  for Human Genetics Research. For quality control and  validation purposes, genotyping was repeated on   $10\%$   of  the samples, and the concordance rate for the replicate  samples was   $100\%$  . The sequences of the primer pairs  used are shown in the Supplementary Table 1.  

# SNP–SNP interactions  

The SNP-SNP interactions were analyzed as  described previously [3]. Multi factor dimensionality  reduction (MDR) (version 3.0_0_2) and MDR-permutation  testing ( MDRpt, version 1.0_beta_2) were adopted to  evaluate the effect of the SNP-SNP interactions on the risk  of developing ischemic stroke [27, 28]. Cross-validation  and permutation tests were conducted to evaluate the  validity of these models for predicting the risk of ischemic  stroke. For multi loci models, the highest level of testing  accuracy and the cross-validation consistency (CVC)  were used for determining the best candidate interaction  model. Furthermore, a testing accuracy level greater than  0.5 was required in the true-positive models. Statistical  significance was analyzed by the implementation of 1000- fold permutation testing methods, and a  $P$   value less than  0.05 was considered statistically significant.  

# Statistical analysis  

A chi-square goodness of fit test was conducted  to determine the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of the  frequency distribution of each SNP in the control group  (Table 2). Chi-square tests were also conducted to  compare the differences in categorical covariates between  the patients and controls. Logistic regression analysis  was performed to evaluate the association of each SNP  with the risk of ischemic stroke and its subtypes. The  Hosmer-Leme show goodness of fit test was performed  to assess the calibration of the logistic regression model.  For single comparison, a   $P$   value  $<0.05$   was considered  statistically significant. For multiple comparisons, the  Bonferroni correction was adopted for correcting the   $P$   values. A  $P$    value   $<0.05/$  /number of comparisons was  considered statistically significant.The analysis of linkage  d is equilibrium (LD) was performed, and haplotype blocks  were identified using Haploview v4.2, then the haplotypes  were reconstructed using the PHASE software v2.1;the  effect of the potential interactions between these five  tSNPs on susceptibility to ischemic stroke was analyzed  by MDR. The statistical analyses were conducted using  IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (Armonk, NY, USA:  IBM Corp.).
