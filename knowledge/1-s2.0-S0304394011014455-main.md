Aims : Meta-analysis was   performed to investigate the   association between 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH (the gene encoding for    protein    kinase     ${\textsf{C}}{\mathfrak{n}}$  )    and    ischemic stroke    among Chinese and    Japanese populations. Methods : The databases of MEDLINE, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and    WANFANG DATA    until    September 2011    were    searched for published case-control studies on   1425G/A SNP   in PRKCH and ischemic stroke.   Strict selection criteria and exclusion criteria were determined, and    pooled    odds    ratio    (OR)    and    the     $95\%$  conﬁdence interval (CI)    were calculated using a ﬁxed   or random   effects   model   to   determine the strength of the   genetic association. The publication bias was further    evaluated by    calculating the fail-safe    number in    the included studies. Results : Five studies, comprising 3686 cases and    4589 controls, passed    all the    criteria    and    therefore were included in the meta-analysis. Test    for    heterogeneity showed that     $P$  values  $'P\!=\!0.76$  ,    0.24,    respectively) in the two    metaanalyses were both greater   than   0.05, therefore the   ﬁxed   effects model was performed. Statistically signiﬁcant association between 1425G/A    SNP    in PRKCH and    ischemic stroke    was    identiﬁed (  $\mathbf{\dot{O}R}=1.34$  ;  $95\%$  CI,    1.22–1.47), and    the association was even stronger between 1425G/A SNP    in    PRKCH    and    lacunar infarction  $\mathbf{\dot{O}R}=1.44$  ;     $95\%$  CI, 1.28–1.63). The    fail-safe    number     $\left(N_{\mathrm{fs}\,0.05}\right)$  for 1425G/A    SNP    in    PRKCH with ischemic stroke and   lacunar infarction was   59 and 44, respectively, which   were   greater than the number of studies included in    the    analyses. Conclusions : SNP    1425G/A in PRKCH    was    associated with    ischemic stroke, particularly lacunar   infarction, in Chinese and Japanese populations. More   studies of different subtypes of    stroke    need    to    be done to    conﬁrm the    results in    other Asian populations.

# 1. Introduction  

from Japanese population. It is worth notifying that SNP 1425G/A in PRKCH may be speciﬁc to Asian populations according to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of the 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH reported in the HapMap database. In particular, the MAF is 0.008 in CEPH samples (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) and 0.00 in Yoruba from Ibadan in Nigeria, while 0.239 in Japanese in Tokyo and 0.178 in Han Chinese in Beijing [12] . Various studies which mainly focused on Chinese and Japanese populations were designed to reproduce the association between 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH and ischemic stroke, but showed contradictory results [2,24,12,19] .  

Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world and approximately 5.7 million people worldwide die from stroke every year [22,18,25,11,8] . Previous studies mainly focused on identifying the general risk factors of ischemic stroke such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, cardiac diseases, and so on [3,14] . Recently genome-wide screening of “stroke gene” has become imminent with the signiﬁcant progress of the genotyping technologies [7,12,6,16] .    PRKCH (the gene encoding for protein kinase  $\textsf{C}\mathfrak{n})$  ) was identiﬁed in 2007 as a new candidate gene for cere- bral infarction by a large-scale genetic epidemiological study using genome-wide SNP analysis in Japanese population [12] . The same group further reproduced the association between SNP 1425G/A in PRKCH and ischemic stroke in an independent case-control sample  

Therefore, we performed the meta-analysis to determine the association between 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH and ischemic stroke among Chinese and Japanese populations.  

# 2. Methods  

# 2.1. Systematic literature search  

A systematic and up-to-date (until September 2011) literature search was done through the databases of MEDLINE, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Database ( http://sinomed.imicams.ac.cn/ index.jsp ), China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( http://dlib3. cnki.net  $/{\mathrm{kns}}50/$  ), and WANFANG DATA ( http://g.wan fang data.  $\mathsf{c o m.c n/I}$  ). The terms used for search were one from ischemic stroke, cerebral infarction, stroke, cerebro vascular disease, and lacunar infarction in combination with anyone of 1425G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2230500, PRKCH, and protein kinase  ${\textsf{C}}{\mathfrak{n}}$  . Two investigators extracted data independently and reached a consensus on all of the data.  

Inclusion criteria were: published well-designed case-control studies investigating 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH in English or Chinese language; within Chinese or Japanese population; sufﬁcient neuro imaging data (magnetic resonance or computer tomography) to make the diagnosis of ischemic stroke; and analyzed as a dichotomous trait. In all of these studies, the genotype frequencies in control groups should be consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.  

Exclusion criteria were: patients younger than 18 years’ old, evaluation of quantitative or intermediate phenotypes exclusively, or studies without genotype distribution. Larger dataset was required for duplicate publications.  

# 2.2. Statistical analysis  

Data were analyzed using Revman 5.0 software ( www.ccims.net.RevMan ). A pooled odds ratio (OR) and the  $95\%$  conﬁdence interval (CI) were calculated to determine the strength of the genetic association. Heterogeneity test was performed. The ﬁxed effects model was used when there was not any signiﬁcant differ- ence among each study  $(P\!>\!0.05)$  otherwise, the random effects model was used.  

# 2.3. Evaluation of publication bias  

We assessed publication bias by calculating the fail-safe number  $(N_{\mathrm{fs}})$  for the meta-analysis using the following equation:  $N_{\mathrm{fs}\,0.05}\,{=}\,(\,\Sigma Z/1.64)^{2}-k,$  − ,  $\left(P\!=\!0.05\right)$  where  $k$  is the number of stud- ies included in one meta-analysis. If the  $N_{\mathrm{fs}}$   was smaller than the number of included studies, then we considered the existence of publication bias in the meta-analysis result.  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. Search results  

The initial search identiﬁed a total of eight studies. Five of them out of which two were from Chinese population and three from Japanese population, with a total of 8275 subjects, were ﬁnally retrieved [2,24,12,19] . For the three studies excluded, one was a duplicate study; one was unpublished; and the other one was in a language different from Chinese or English.  

Among the ﬁve studies associated with 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH, Wu et al. studied all types of stroke without further class i cation of ischemic stroke [24] . The study conducted by Cheng et al. focused on lacunar infarction [2,1] . Serizawa et al. limited the subjects into silent brain infarction to better study the genetics of lacunar infarction [15,9,19,10] . Other two studies were both led by Kubo et al.: one was the initial genome-wide case-control study with detailed class i cation of ischemic stroke into lacunar infarction, atherosclerosis, card i oem boli c and undetermined stroke, and the other was a reproduced study targeting the subjects from BioBank Japan project with lacunar infarction [20,12] . Additionally, since four studies except the one from Wu et al. investigated the association between lacunar infarction and 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH, we performed another meta-analysis based on that. Details of each

study are shown in Table 1 and the genotype distributions are listed in Table 2 .  

# 3.2. Results of meta-analyses  

Test for heterogeneity showed that  $P$  values (  $P\!=\!0.76$  0.24, respectively) in the two meta-analyses were both greater than 0.05, therefore the ﬁxed effects model was performed. The results of meta-analysis on the association between 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH and ischemic stroke were statistically signiﬁcant, and the pooled OR for  $\mathsf{G A}\,\!+\!\mathsf{A A}$  versus GG was 1.34  $(95\%\,{\sf C I}=1.22\substack{-1.47}$   $P\!<\!0.00001$  as shown in Fig. 1 . Statistically signiﬁcant results of meta-analysis on 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH and lacunar infarction were also identiﬁed, and the pooled OR for  $\mathsf{G A}\,\!+\!\mathsf{A A}$  versus GG was 1.44 (  $95\%$   $\mathsf{C I}=1.28\!-\!1.63$   $P\!<\!0.00001$  as shown in Fig. 2 .  

In order to test and verify the association, we    excluded the subjects from BioBank Japan project which weighed the largest in the two meta-analyses performed (  $'37.8\%$  and  $64.7\%$  , respectively). After the exclusion, the meta-analyses were run again. Results were still signiﬁcant with OR 1.36 and 1.67, respectively ( Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 online ).  

# 3.3. Evaluation of publication bias  

The fail-safe number  $(N_{\mathrm{fs}})$  was calculated for each meta-analysis to assess publication bias. The  $N_{\mathrm{fs}\,0.05}$   for 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH with ischemic stroke and lacunar infarction were 59 and 44, respectively, which were greater than the number of studies included in each analysis. For the meta-analyses without subjects from BioBank Japan project, the  $N_{\mathrm{fs}\,0.05}$   were 31 and 20, respectively, which were also greater than the number of studies included in those analyses.  

# 4. Discussion  

Our meta-analyses showed that 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke among Chinese and Japanese populations ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). People with genotype of GA or AA had about 1.34 times greater risk of developing ischemic stroke than those with GG, and 1.44 times greater risk of developing lacunar infarction. The results were of great sign i can ce and suggested the possibility of new preventive measures for ischemic stroke.

Recently accumulating evidence suggests that in amma tion and atherosclerosis play important roles in the development of stroke [21,4,23,5] .    Protein kinase  $\mathsf{C}\,\boldsymbol{\upeta}\left(\mathsf{P K C}\,\boldsymbol{\upeta}\right)$  is a serine–threonine kinase identiﬁed in 1990 and is mainly expressed in vascular endo the li al cells and foamy macrophages that are essential in all phages of atherosclerosis. Additionally, PKC ' is likely to be affected by 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH [13,12,17] .  

In the present study, we used the ﬁxed effects model  $(P\!>\!0.05)$  which is a more accurate method because data for the ﬁxed effects model require good heterogeneity. Moreover, the possibility of publication bias was negligible with  $N_{\mathrm{fs}\,0.05}\,59$  and 44, respectively, which were much greater than the number of included studies. It is worth mentioning that we performed new meta-analyses to test and verify the association after excluding the largest weight, and again the results turned out to be signiﬁcant ( Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 online ). In addition, selection criteria and exclusion criteria were strictly followed. Therefore, the results of our meta-analyses are reliable.  

There are also some limitations in this work. Five studies with limited populations were retrieved and other subtypes of stroke were not studied, so we only did the meta-analyses about the association of 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH with ischemic stroke and lacunar infarction among Chinese and Japanese populations. More studies of different subtypes of stroke need to be done to conﬁrm the results in other Asian populations besides the Japanese and Chinese.  

In summary, the evidence from the present meta-analyses suggested that 1425G/A SNP in PRKCH was associated with ischemic stroke, particularly lacunar infarction, in Chinese and Japanese populations.
