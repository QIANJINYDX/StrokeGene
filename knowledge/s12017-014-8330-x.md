Abstract Previous studies suggested an association between 1425G/A polymorphism in  PRKCH  and stroke risk, but the results were inconsistent. To obtain a more precise estimation, we carried out a meta-analysis to analyze the effect of 1425G/A SNP in  PRKCH  on stroke risk. We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG Data for all eligible case–control studies through April 2014. The odds ratios (ORs), together with the   $95~\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CIs), were calculated to evaluate the strength of association between 1425G/A SNP and stroke risk. Overall, seven eligible studies involving a total of 4,574 cases and 5,471 controls were included in our meta-analysis. The results showed that the variant genotypes of 1425G/A polymorphism in  PRKCH were sign i cant ly associated with a higher risk of stroke in all genetic models (GA vs. GG: OR 1.35,   $95~\%$   CI

 1.24–1.47,    $P<0.001$  ; AA vs. GG: OR 1.50,   $95~\%$   CI

 1.24–1.82,  $P<0.001$  ; GA/AA vs. GG: OR 1.37,   $95~\%$   CI

 1.26–1.49,  $P<0.001$  ; AA vs. GA/GG: OR 1.35,   $95~\%$   CI

 1.12–1.62,    $P=0.002$  ; A vs. G: OR 1.29,   $95~\%$   CI

 1.21–1.39,    $P<0.001\$  ). In the subgroup analysis, signiﬁ- cantly increased risks were also observed for ischemic stroke, larger sample size   $_{(>1,000)}$   and population-based studies. The result of our meta-analysis indicated that the 1425G/A SNP in  PRKCH  may contribute to susceptibility of stroke, especially for ischemic stroke.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a common neurological disease and a leading cause of death worldwide (Go et al.  2013 ; Kubo et al.  2007 ). The stroke patient will have a very low quality of life suffering from disability, cognitive dysfunction and many other complications (Kiyohara et al.  2003 ), leading to a serious burden to the whole society (Strong et al.  2007 ; Lopez et al.  2006 ).  

Ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke are the two main subtypes of stroke (Markus  2011 ). Like many other complex diseases, genetic factors have been considered as an important risk contributor to the development of stroke (Johnston et al.  2009 ). Twins and family studies have proven a substantial genetic contribution to the risk of stroke (Jerrard-Dunne et al.  2003 ; Flossmann et al.  2004 ; Bak et al.  2002 ; Liao et al.  1997 ).  

Over the past 20 years, the candidate gene association studies and classical linkage approaches were widely adopted to identify genes involved in stroke occurrence and recurrence. However, few associations have been consistently replicated. Recently, genome-wide association study (GWAS) has emerged as a powerful new tool to identify many susceptibility variants with moderate genetic risk on various complex diseases (Hirschhorn and Daly  2005 ). In 2007, Kubo et al. reported that a non synonymous SNP (1425G/A, rs2230500) in  PRKCH  could increase the risk of cerebral infarction (Kubo et al.  2007 ). Thereafter, the original report has been followed by many publications in an attempt to replicate this ﬁnding; some conﬁrmed the association (Serizawa et al.  2008 ; Wu et al.  2009 ; Song et al.  2008 ), whereas others failed to replicate it (Cheng et al.  2009 ,  2012 ). The association between this SNP with stroke risk has been a research focus and has drawn increasing attention. Because a single study might have been underpowered to detect the overall effects, a quantitative synthesis of the accumulated data from different studies was deemed more important to provide evidence on the association of this SNP with stroke risk. Thus, we carried out a meta-analysis on all eligible case–control studies to estimate the overall stroke risk of  PRKCH 1425G/A polymorphism as well as to quantify the betweenstudy heterogeneity and potential bias.  

# Materials and Methods  

# Literature Search and Study Selection  

We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG Data for all eligible case–control studies through April 2014. The associated medical subject headings and terms were as follows: stroke, ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke in combination with PRKCH, 1452G/A SNP, Protein kinase   $\mathbf{C}\boldsymbol{\upeta}$   or rs2230500. No language restrictions were imposed. Abstracts, reviews or editorials were not included.  

Studies included in our meta-analysis had to meet the criteria as follows: (1) had neuro imaging (CT or MRI) result to conﬁrm the diagnosis of stroke, (2) case–control studies and (3) evaluated the association between 1425G/A in  PRKCH  and stroke susceptibility. Studies were excluded if: (1) the age of patients was under 18, and (2) original genotype data were not reported. As for duplicate publications, we chose the one with a larger sample size.  

# Data Extraction  

Two investigators (S.L. and Z.Z.) independently extracted all data according to the selection criteria and reached a consensus on all of the items. The following characteristics were sought: the ﬁrst author’s last name, the year of publication, country, sample size and the genotype distribution of samples in case and control groups, the minor allelic frequencies (MAF) in control groups, source of control, genotyping method and matching criteria.  

Statistical Analysis  

We ﬁrst examined whether the genotype distribution in control group was consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by chi-square test for each study. The odds ratios (ORs), together with the   $95~\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CIs), were then calculated to evaluate the strength of association between 1425G/A SNP in  PRKCH  and stroke risk. The statistical sign i can ce of summary OR value was evaluated by    $Z$   test, and    $P$   value    ${<}0.05$   was considered to

be statistically signiﬁcant. To estimate the association between 1425G/A SNP and stroke risk, we ﬁrst evaluated the risks of the AA and AG genotypes separately in comparison with the wild-type GG homozygote. Then, we estimated the dominant (AA/AG vs. GG) and recessive (AA vs. AG/GG) effects of the variant A allele on the occurrence of stroke, respectively. Meanwhile, we also estimated the risk of variant A allele on stroke risk compared with G allele. In addition, stratiﬁed analyses were performed by subtype, country, sample size and source of control.  

Heterogeneity within and between subgroups were evaluated with the    $Q$   test and    $I^{2}$    statistics (Higgins and Thompson  2002 ). Heterogeneity exists if    $P$   value of    $Q$   test  ${<}0.05$  . If no signiﬁcant heterogeneity existed, the ﬁxedeffects model (the Mantel–Haenszel method) was adopted to calculate the summary OR value. Otherwise, the random-effects model (the Der Simoni an and Laird method) was used. The stratiﬁed analyses were performed to test the robustness of the association.  

Cumulative meta-analysis was adopted to update a genetic effect from all studies and to measure the changes of the inﬂuence on diseases as new evidence accumulated (Lau et al.  1992 ; Zhang et al.  2012 ). Therefore, we could evaluate the variation trend of the effect about 1425G/A SNP on stroke through cumulative meta-analysis.  

Sensitivity analyses were also performed to estimate the stability of the results. A single study included in our metaanalysis was deleted each time, and then, all the rest studies were analyzed to reﬂect the inﬂuence of the individual study to the pooled ORs. Besides, in order to assess the potential publication bias, we used funnel plots and Egger’s linear regression test. All analyses were done with Stata software version 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).  

# Results  

Literature Search and Study Characteristics  

Figure  1  showed the ﬂow diagram of the literature search. Total searches yielded 25 entries. Ten studies were excluded because of obvious irrelevance. Fifteen potentially relevant studies were reviewed. Another eight studies were excluded after reading the title and abstract for the following reasons: not exploring the association between 1425G/A SNP and stroke   $(n=5)$  ), reviews   $(n=2)$  ), analyzed the recurrence of stroke   $(n=1)$  ). As a result, seven studies were included in our meta-analysis. The characteristics of each study are summarized in Table  1 . These seven included studies were published between 2007 and 2012. Totally, 4,574 cases and 5,471 controls were included in our meta-analysis. Of the seven studies, four studies used frequency-matched controls to the cases by the age and sex. A classic polymerase chain reaction assay was performed in all of the seven studies. In addition, ﬁve of them studied ischemic stroke, one focusing on cerebral hemorrhage and another one including all subtypes of stroke (Wu et al. 2009 ). The distribution of genotypes in selected studies is shown in Table  2 . The genotype distributions among the controls of all studies were in accordance with HWE.  

Quantitative Synthesis  

Overall, the variant genotypes of 1425G/A polymorphism in  PRKCH  were associated with a sign i cant ly higher risk of stroke in different genetic models. As shown in Table  3 , the variant genotypes GA and AA were associated with a sign i cant ly higher risk of stroke in a dose–response manner, compared with the wild-type homozygote GG (OR 1.35,   $95~\%$   CI 1.24–1.47 for GA and 1.50, 1.24–1.82 for AA;    $P_{\mathrm{tend}}<0.001$  ). In addition, signiﬁcant associations

were also observed in dominant model (Fig.  2 ), recessive model and allele contrast model (OR 1.37,   $95~\%$   CI 1.26–1.49, OR 1.35,   $95~\%$   CI 1.12–1.62 and OR 1.29,  $95~\%$   CI 1.21–1.39, respectively).  

In the stratiﬁed analysis by subtype, sign i cant ly increased risks were observed for ischemic stroke (GA vs. GG: OR 1.34,  $95~\%$   CI 1.22–1.47; AA vs. GG: OR 1.54,  $95~\%$   CI 1.24–1.90; dominant model: OR 1.36,   $95~\%$   CI 1.24–1.49; recessive model: OR 1.38,   $95~\%$   CI 1.12–1.70; allele model: OR 1.29,   $95~\%$   CI 1.20–1.39), especially for lacunar infarction (GA vs. GG: OR 1.46,   $95~\%$   CI 1.29–1.64; AA vs. GG: OR 2.16,   $95~\%$   CI 1.13–4.12; dominant model: OR 1.49,   $95~\%$   CI 1.32–1.67; recessive model: OR 1.81,   $95~\%$   CI  $1.00–3.27$  ; allele model: OR 1.50,   $95~\%$   CI 1.23–1.84), but only with borderline statistical sign i can ce for hemorrhagic stroke (GA vs. GG: OR 1.35,   $95~\%$   CI 1.02–1.77; dominant model: OR 1.35,  $95~\%$   CI   $1.04{-}1.75$  ; allele model: OR 1.27,   $95~\%$   CI 1.02–1.57).  

In addition, in the stratiﬁed analysis by sample size, statistically sign i cant ly elevated risk was also observed, and this elevated risk was more pronounced among studies with sample size  ${>}1{,}000$     $(P_{\mathrm{heterogeneity}}=0.58$   for dominant model, Table  3 ). Moreover, signiﬁcant association was observed among studies using the population-based controls, but not the hospital-based controls (Table  3 ). The cumulative meta-analysis for the dominant model showed a trend of the association as the evidence accumulated (Fig.  3 ).  

Sensitivity Analyses  

Since the MAF in Cheng’s study was much lower than that in other studies, we removed this study for sensitivity analyses ﬁrst. As a result, the pooled OR   $95~\%$   CI) was 1.37 (1.26–1.49). Then, we dropped one study each time and analyzed the rest studies to observe the change of pooled ORs. The range of pooled ORs was from 1.35 to 1.39, indicating that the result of this meta-analysis was stable.  

Publication Bias  

The funnel plot did not show any obvious asymmetry (Fig.  4 ). Egger’s test also indicated no evidence of publication bias (  $P=0.852)$  ).  

# Discussion  

The present meta-analysis explored the association between 1425G/A polymorphism in  PRKCH  and risk of stroke. We found that this variant was associated with signiﬁcant increase in overall stroke risk.  

$\mathsf{P K C n}$  , decoded by  PRKCH , belongs to the atypical isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) family since it is regulated by dia cy l glycerol and phospholipids (Spitaler and Cantrell  2004 ; Kubo et al.  2007 ).   $\mathsf{P K C n}$   plays a very important role in signal transduction pathways essential for the activation and homeostasis of immune responses (Spitaler and Cantrell  2004 ).  $\mathsf{P K C n}$   is highly abundant in T cells and has an important role in T cell stimulation (Fu et al.  2011 ). In addition,  $\mathsf{P K C n}$   participates in the process of atherosclerosis and the non synonymous SNP (1425G/A) in  PRKCH  causes enhancement of PKC activity, which may increase stroke risk (Kubo et al.  2007 ).  

In the subgroup analysis by subtype, sign i cant ly higher stroke risk was observed in ischemic stroke but with borderline statistical sign i can ce in hemorrhagic stroke. Moreover, in the subtype analysis of ischemic stroke, this effect was more pronounced in lacunar infraction. Lacunar infraction, a subtype of ischemic stroke, was ﬁrst reported to have a signiﬁcant association with 1425G/A SNP in  PRKCH  by Kubo et al. In our stratiﬁed analysis, the variant genotypes were associated with a sign i cant ly higher risk of lacunar infraction in all genetic models. The borderline signiﬁcant association in hemorrhagic stroke was likely due to the small number of cases, which led to a lower statistical power to estimate this association.  

In our present study, we also found that the association between the 1425G/A polymorphism and stroke risk among studies using the population-based controls was stronger than that among studies with hospitalbased controls. Compared with population-based studies, hospital-based ones have intrinsic selection biases for the reason that hospital-based controls may not represent the general population very well, particularly when the genotypes under investigation were associated with the disease-related conditions that the hospital-based controls may have. Thus, selecting appropriate and representative population-based controls has an important role in reducing bias for such genotype association analysis.  

Our meta-analysis added to the evidence that 1425G/A polymorphism played a part in the process of stroke. In addition, the cumulative meta-analysis was also adopted to evaluate the trend of the association as evidence accumulated. However, some limitations should be addressed. First, most of the studies had a relatively small sample size. Thus, larger well-designed studies should be conducted to further conﬁrm all these results. Second, the studies included in our meta-analysis were all done in Asian populations, and no study with Caucasian populations was reported, which might be due to the low MAF (Traylor et al.  2012 ). According to HapMap database, the MAF of 1425G/A SNP is reported to be 0.239 in Japanese, 0.178 in Han Chinese Population in Beijing and 0.008 in CHEP samples (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) (Kubo et al.  2007 ). Thus, more evidence was needed from other populations to further investigate the association between the  PRKCH  1425G/A polymorphism and stroke risk.  

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provided evidence that the variant 1425G/A SNP in  PRKCH  was associated with a signiﬁcant higher risk of stroke. As studies among the Europeans and Africans are currently limited, further studies including a wider spectrum of subjects should be conducted to explore the role of this functional variant in other populations, which should lead to better, comprehensive understanding of the association between the PRKCH  1425G/A polymorphism and stroke risk.
