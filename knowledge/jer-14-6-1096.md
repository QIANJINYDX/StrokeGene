The progression of ischemic stroke is associated with inflammatory response, in which the nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1) plays an  important role. The aim of present study was to determine whether promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the  NFKB1  gene was  contributed to susceptibility of ischemic stroke. One hundred twenty-one Korean adult patients with ischemic stroke   $(65.7\pm12.1$   years in  age) and 291 Korean healthy controls   $(63.0\pm9.3$   years in age) were recruited. We genotyped a promoter SNP (rs11940017, -1727,   $\complement/\Pi)$   of  NFKB1  gene using direct sequencing in 121 Korean ischemic stroke patients and 291 control subjects. The  $\upuparrow/0$   genotype of rs11940017 SNP in  the codominant model (vs. the T/T genotype) (odds ratio [OR], 0.38;  $95\%$  

# INTRODUCTION  

Ischemic stroke terms a condition caused by the occlusion of a  blood vessel supplying the brain (Ceulemans et al., 2010) and  represents more than  $80\%$   of all stroke cases (Candelario-Jalil,  2009; Durukan and Tatlisumak, 2007). Recent evidence indicates  that inflammation plays an important role in ischemic stroke  (McColl et al., 2009). Chronic inflammatory response is associated  with stroke and neuro degenerative diseases (Frank-Cannon et al.,  2009; Lucas et al., 2006). Moreover, after cerebral ischemia, the  death of ischemic neurons and the release of necrotic cell debris  trigger a robust inflammatory reaction (Lelekov-Boissard et al.,  2009; Simi et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007). Many therapeutic  trials for inflammation-associated brain injuries have been applied  (Cho et al., 2015; Han et al., 2016; Shin et al., 2016).  

Nuclear factor-kappaB ( NFKB ) is a major transcription regula­ confidence interval [CI], 0.15–0.92;   $P{=}0.032)$   and the genotype containing C allele   $\uppi/0$   and   $\complement/\complement)$   in the dominant model (vs. the   $\upuparrows$   genotype)  (OR, 0.33;  $95\%$   CI, 0.14–0.81;   $\scriptstyle P=0.0068)$   were associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke. The frequency of C allele was decreased in ischemic stroke patients, compared with control subjects  (OR, 0.31;  $95\%$   CI, 0.13–0.74;   $\scriptstyle P=0.008,$  ). These results suggest that the  promoter SNP (rs11940017, -1727, C/T) of  NFKB1  gene may affect isch- emic stroke susceptibility in Korean population.

tor of immune response, apoptosis, and cell-growth control genes  (Karban et al., 2004). It plays a central role in modulation of in­ flammation (Orozco et al., 2005). The  NFKB  names a variety of  transcription factors that are homo- or hetero-dimers of p50, p52,  p65, RelB, and c-Rel (Pereira and Oakley, 2008; Perkins, 2007).  Of those subunits, the p50, encoded by  NFKB1  gene, is known to  have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. The   $\mathrm{p}50/\mathrm{p}65$    he t ero dimer stimulates transcription of pro-inflammatory cyto­ kines, whereas the   $\mathsf{p}50/\mathsf{p}50$   homodimer induces transcription of  anti-inflammatory cytokine (Cao et al., 2006; Ghosh et al., 1998;  Pereira and Oakley, 2008; Perkins, 2007). Thus, the expression of  NFKB1  gene may be related to balancing the inflammatory re­ sponse (Pereira and Oakley, 2008).  

Considering the known relevance of inflammation in ischemic  stroke, a possible role of  NFKB1  gene polymorphisms on suscep­ tibility to ischemic stroke cannot be ruled out. We analyzed single  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of  NFKB1  gene  and investigated the genetic association between susceptibility of  ischemic stroke and  NFKB1  gene in Korean population.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Subjects  

One hundred twenty-one Korean adult patients with ischemic  stroke   $(65.7\pm12.1\$   years in age, mean ± standard deviation) and  291 Korean healthy controls   $(63.0\pm9.3$   years) were enrolled for  this study. The patient group was comprised of 68 males and 53  females. Each patient was diagnosed using the cranial computed  tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or angiography.  The patients were classified by well-trained two physicians into  clinical phenotypes according to the results of the National Insti­ tutes of Health Stroke Survey (NIHSS) and the Modified Barthel  Index (MBI), respectively. The neurological deficit on admission  was measured using the NIHSS. The outcome at hospital dis­ charge was assessed using the MBI. Patients with trauma, vascular  malformations, brain tumors, and congenital brain disorders were  excluded. The control group was comprised of 152 men and 139  women. Healthy control subjects were selected among partici­ pants examined in a general health check-up program. Partici­ pants with transient ischemic attack, ischemic heart diseases, and

other at hero sclerotic diseases were excluded. Age and gender of  the control group was matched with those of the patient group. A  summary of demographic findings of ischemic stroke patients and  control subjects were provided in Table 1. Written informed con­ sent was obtained from each patient or the legal guardian. The  protocol for this study was approved by the ethics review commit­ tee of the Medical Research Institute, School of Medicine, Kyung  Hee University (Seoul, Korea).  

# SNP selection and genotyping  

We searched SNPs of  NFKB1  gene in the coding and promoter  regions. Relevant information was obtained from the National Cen­ ter for Biotechnology Information SNP database (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/SNP; dbSNP BUILD 131). There were 16 SNPs with  a he ter oz y gos it y  $>\!0.1$   in the coding and promoter regions of  NFKB1 .  Of those SNPs, all of 6 SNPs in the coding region and 9 of   $10\,\mathrm{SNPS}$    in the promoter region were excluded because of mono m orphic  genotype. Consequently, rs11940017 (-1727, C/T) in the promoter  region was selected.  

Peripheral blood samples were collected from each subject and  then stored in a  $\mathrm{-20^{\circ}C}$   refrigerator. Genomic DNA was extracted  from the blood samples using a QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIA­ GEN, Valencia, CA, USA). SNP genotyping was conducted by  direct sequencing (MACROGEN, Seoul, Korea). Polymerase  chain reactions (PCRs) were performed with specific primer for  rs11940017 (Table 2). The PCR products were sequenced using  an ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems  Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence data were analyzed using  SeqManII software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA).  

# Statistical analysis  

The SNPStats (Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Unit, Barcelona,  Spain) was used to analyze genetic data. Hardy-Weinberg equilib­ rium (HWE) was assessed. The effects of SNP genotypes were an­ alyzed using 4 models; codominant (codominant 1: T/T  [ reference ]  vs. T/C; codominant   $2;\mathrm{T/T}$   vs. C/C), dominant (T/T  [ reference ]  vs.   $\mathrm{T/C_{+}C/C})$  , recessive   $\mathrm{(T/T+T/C}$  [ reference ]  vs. C/C), and log-additive (T/T vs. T/C vs. C/C) models (Yang,  $2017a$  ; Yang, 2017b).  Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds ratios

# RESULTS  

Genotype distribution of rs11940017 SNP (-1727, C/T) of  NFKB1  gene in the control group was consistent with the HWE   $(P\,{>}\,0.05$  ; data not shown). The genotyping data revealed that  rs11940017 SNP (-1727,   $\mathrm{C/T)}$   was associated with the suscepti­ bility of ischemic stroke (Table 3). The frequencies of T/T, T/C,  and C/C genotypes were   $86.2\%$  ,   $12.4\%$  , and   $1.4\%$  , respectively  in the control group, and   $95.0\%$  ,  $5.0\%$  , and   $0\%$   in the ischemic  stroke group, respectively. The  $\mathrm{T/C}$   genotype was associated with  a decreased risk of ischemic stroke, compared to the  $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotype  (codominant model; OR, 0.38;   $95\%$   CI, 0.15–0.92;  $P\,{=}\,0.032$  ).  In the analysis using the dominant model, the genotype contain­ ing C allele   $\mathrm{T/C}$   and  $\mathrm{C/C})$   was associated with a decreased risk of  ischemic stroke, compared to the  $\mathrm{T/T}$   genotype (OR, 0.33;   $95\%$    CI,   $0.14{-}0.81$  ;   $P\,{=}\,0.0068$  ). The frequencies of T and C alleles  were   $92.4\%$   and   $7.6\%$  , respectively in the control group, and 

  $97.5\%$   and  $2.5\%$  , respectively in the ischemic stroke group (OR, 

 0.31;  $95\%$   CI,  $0.13{-}0.74$  ;  $P\,{=}\,0.008)$  . These data suggest that the  promoter SNP (rs11940017, -1727, C/T) of  NFKB1  gene was as­ sociated with susceptibility of ischemic stroke.  

# DISCUSSION  

The relation between peripheral immune cells and the brain has  been suggested (Park et al., 2016). In this study, we observed that  the  NFKB1  promoter polymorphism, rs11940017 (-1727, C/T),  was associated with ischemic stroke. We particularly found that  the C allele of rs11940017 might contribute to a decreased risk of  ischemic stroke in Korean population.  

The  NFKB1  gene encodes a   $105~\mathrm{kD}$   non-DNA-binding pro­ tein (p105) of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$  ), which can under­ go co translational processing to produce a 50-kD DNA-binding  protein (p50) (Karban et al., 2004). NF $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$   names a number of  different transcription factors that are homo- or hetero-dimers of  p50, p52, p65, RelB and c-Rel (Pereira and Oakley, 2008; Per­ kins, 2007). The major form of NF $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$   is a he t ero dimer of the   $\mathfrak{p}50$   and  $\mathsf{p}65$   subunits (Chen et al., 1999). The   $\mathsf{p}50$   subunit, en­ coded by  NFKB1  gene, has both pro- and anti-inflammatory  properties: As part of the  $\mathrm{p}50/\mathrm{p}65$   he t ero dimer, the  $\mathfrak{p}50$   controls  transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tissue necrosis  factor and interleukin $.1\upbeta$   (Perkins, 2007). In the   $\mathsf{p}50/\mathsf{p}50$   ho­ modimer, it has anti-inflammatory properties by repressing tran­ scription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and by stimulating tran­ scription of anti-inflammatory cytokine (Cao et al., 2006; Ghosh  et al., 1998; Pereira and Oakley, 2008). Thus, the relative abun­ dance of   $\mathrm{p}50/\mathrm{p}65$   he ter odi mers and   $\mathfrak{p}50$   homodimers may deter­ mine the magnitude of inflammation by balancing the pro-in­ flammatory and anti-inflammatory responses (Pereira and Oakley,  2008). If an altered  NFKB1  transcription would lead to a de­ creased  $\mathsf{p}50$   synthesis, fewer   $\mathsf{p}50$   homodimers may be formed and  a stronger activation of transcription of pro-inflammatory genes  can be induced (Borm et al., 2005). Given this role in inflamma­ tory processes, polymorphisms in the promoter of  NFKB1  may  modulate the susceptibility to ischemic stroke because inflamma­ tion is a risk factor for ischemic stroke.  

Some clinical studies investigated a relation between a functional  promoter polymorphism of  NFKB1  gene and immune-mediated  diseases including ulcerative colitis (Borm et al., 2005; Karban et  al., 2004), acute respiratory distress syndrome (Adamzik et al.,  2007; Bajwa et al., 2011), cervical cancer, dilated cardiomyopathy  (Zhou et al., 2009), and coronary heart disease (Vogel et al., 2011).  However, the genetic association between  NFKB1  polymorphisms  and ischemic stroke has not been published in the literature, even  though the NFκ B pathway is suggested as one of mechanisms of  ischemic stroke (Martín-Ventura et al., 2004; Nurmi et al., 2004).  Thus, we searched SNPs in the promoter and coding regions of  NFKB1  gene and selected a promoter polymorphism, rs11940017.  In our data, the C allele was the minor allele of rs11940017 and  was related to a lower risk of ischemic stroke (OR, 0.31;   $95\%$   CI,  0.13–0.74). The genotype containing C allele was further decreased  in patients with ischemic stroke. We presumed that the relative  frequency of the T and C alleles of rs11940017 might be able to  alter the activity of  NFKB1  transcription. We expect, in the fur­ ther study, to simultaneously investigate the genotype frequencies  and the NF $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$   activity between ischemic stroke patients and  control subjects.  

In conclusion, we found statistically significant association be­ tween rs11940017 SNP of  NFKB1  gene and the susceptibility to  ischemic stroke in Korean population. Here in this study, we re­ port a relation between  NFKB1  gene and ischemic stroke.
