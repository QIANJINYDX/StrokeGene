Background: The genetic susceptibility to ischemic stroke (IS) is still not well-understood. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASes) found that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Dia cy l glycerol ac yl transfer as e 2 gene ( DGAT2 ) and mono ac yl glycerol O-ac yl transfer as e 2 ( MOGAT2 ) cluster were associated with serum lipid levels. However, the association between the  DGAT2- MOGAT2  SNPs and serum lipid phenotypes has not yet been veriﬁed in the Chinese people. Therefore, the present study was to determine the  DGAT2-MOGAT2  SNPs and gene-environment interactions on serum lipid proﬁles and the risk of IS.  

Methods: Genotyping of 5 SNPs ( DGAT2  rs11236530,  DGAT2  rs3060,  MOGAT2 rs600626,  MOGAT2  rs609379, and  MOGAT2  rs10899104) in 544 IS patients and 561 healthy controls was performed by the next-generation sequencing technologies. The association between genotypes and serum lipid data was determined by analysis of covariance, and a corrected    $P$  -value was adopted after Bonferroni correction. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between genotypes and the risk of IS after adjustment of potential con founders.  

Results: The rs 11236530 A allele was associated with increased risk of IS (CA/AA vs. CC,   $\mathsf{O R}~=~1.45$  ,   $\mathsf{95\%C l}~=~\mathsf{1.12–1.88}$  ,    $P~=~0.0044)$  , whereas the rs600626G-rs609379A-rs10899104G haplotype was associated with decreased risk of IS (adjusted   $\mathsf{O R}=0.67$  ,   $95\%$   ${\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{I}}=0.48{\mathsf{-}}0.93$  ,    $P=0.018)$  . The rs11236530A allele carriers had lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations than the rs11236530A allele non-carriers  $(P~\textrm{<}~0.001)$  The interactions of rs11236530-smoking, rs3060-smoking and rs10899104-smoking inﬂuenced serum apo lipoprotein B levels, whereas the interactions of rs11236530- and rs3060-alcohol affected serum HDL-C levels   $(P_{\|}\ <\ 0.004–0.001)$  . The interaction of rs600626G-rs609379A-rs10899104G-alcohol (  $(\mathsf{O R}=0.41\$  ,   $95\%$     ${\sf C I}\;=\;0.22–0.76)$  and rs600626G-rs609379C-rs10899104T-alcohol   $(\mathsf{O R}=0.12\$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathsf{C l}=0.04–0.36)$  ) decreased the risk of IS   $(P_{\|}<0.0001)$  ).  

Conclusions: The rs11236530A allele was associated with decreased serum HDL-C levels in controls and increased risk of IS in patient group. The rs600626G-rs609379A-rs10899104G haplotype, the rs600626G-rs 609379A-rs10899104G-alcohol and rs600626G-rs609379C-rs10899104T-alcohol interactions were associated with decreased risk of IS. The rs11236530 SNP may be a genetic marker for IS in our study populations.

# INTRODUCTION  

Blood lipid disorder is an important and modiﬁable risk factor for atherosclerosis ( 1 , 2 ). Atherosclerosis, a progressive in amma tory disorder, is the most important cause of cardiovascular disease including ischemic stroke (IS), and its prevalence is high in middle-aged and elderly ( 3 – 5 ). Both dys lipid emi a and IS are common chronic diseases in which multiple genetic and environmental factors and their interaction are believed to involve the risk ( 6 – 8 ). Evidences from familybased ( 9 – 11 ) and twin ( 12 ) investigations have suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could account for   $10-$   $50\%$   of the inter individual variation in blood lipid phenotypes. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed that heritability of IS was  $37.9\%$   ( 13 ), but it varied markedly by stroke subtype: large-vessel disease,   $40.3\%$  ; cardio-embolic disease,  $32.6\%$  ; and small-vessel disease,   $16.1\%$  . It was also diﬀerent between young-onset   $.42\%\pm8\%,$  ,  $P<0.001$  ) and old-onset   $(34\%$   $\pm\,10\%$  ,  $P<0.001$  ) stroke ( 14 ).  

Previous GWASes have identiﬁed many SNPs associated with dys lipid emi a ( 15 – 22 ) and IS ( 23 – 27 ) in diﬀerent populations. Some SNPs involved not only in normal variation in blood lipid traits but also in extreme lipid phenotypes and impact lipid traits ( 28 ,  29 ). These GWASes also identiﬁed many novel SNPs associated with serum lipid parameters ( 15 ,  17 – 22 ,  28 ,  29 ). Two of these newly identiﬁed SNPs were the rs11236530 and rs499974 within the dia cy l glycerol ac yl transfer as e 2 (DGAT2) and mono ac yl glycerol O-ac yl transfer as e 2 (MOGAT2) genes, which were related to lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in European populations ( 28 ,  29 ).  

In the small intestine, MOGAT2 is a key enzyme responsible for triglyceride (TG) re-synthesis ( 30 , 31 ). It catalyzes the synthesis of dia cy l glycerol from free fatty acid and mono ac yl glycerol, two major hydrolysis products of dietary fat ( 32 ). The MOGAT2 expression was high in human small intestine and liver ( 33 ,  34 ). MOGAT2 in entero cyte s was the rate-limiting enzyme for the TG re-synthesis pathway (the mono ac yl glycerol pathway) ( 35 ). Genetic deletion of  MOGAT2 in mice altered the spatial distribution of fat absorption in the small intestine and protected against diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance ( 36 ,  37 ). In a high fat diet induced mouse obese model,  MOGAT2  knockout exhibited multiple healthy metabolic phenotypes, including decreased weight, adiposity and hepatic steatosis, increased energy expenditure, and improved insulin sensitivity ( 31 ). In addition, enhanced release of anorectic gut peptides such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), and altered macro nutrient preferences shifted away from fat were also observed in  MOGAT2  knockout mice ( 36 ,  38 ).  

DGAT2 is also a key enzyme that catalyzes the ﬁnal step of TG biosynthesis ( 39 ,  40 ), in which fatty acyl-CoA and dia cy l glycerol molecules covalently join to form TG. Over expression of DGAT2 in mouse liver causes signiﬁcant hepatic steatosis as evidenced by increased hepatic TG levels but not insulin resistance ( 41 ), whereas in obese mice induced by high-fat diet or leptindeﬁciency for 7 weeks, inhibition of DGAT2 with an optimized antisense oli go nucleotide resulted in marked reduction in hepatic TG as well as blood TG, dia cy l glycerol, and free fatty acid levels ( 42 ).  DGAT2  in humans is located at chromosome 11q13.3 comprising eight exons ( 43 ). Seventeen mutations have been identiﬁed in the coding region, the predicted promoter region, and in the   $5^{'}$   non-coding exon, but the functionality of these SNPs has not been evaluated or reported ( 44 ). Moreover, most of these reported mutations are rare in the Chinese populations ( 45 ). Two of common SNPs in  DGAT2 , rs3060 and rs101988116, are located at the   $3^{'}$   UTR and  $5^{'}\mathrm{UTR}$  UTR in the  DGAT2 , respectively. They have been associated with smaller liver fat changes in response to niacin treatment in patients with dys lipid emi a, suggesting these non-coding polymorphisms might be related to functional eﬀects and could aﬀect the p harm a co dynamics of niacin ( 45 ). To the best of our knowledge, however, the associations between the  DGAT2-MOGAT2  SNPs and serum lipid levels in the Chinese populations, and the susceptibility to IS have not been explored previously. Therefore, the current investigation was undertaken to detect the association between the 5  DGAT2-MOGAT2  SNPs and serum lipid traits and IS risk in the Southern Han Chinese population.  

# METHODS  

# Patients  

This study included 544 hospitalized IS patients from our First Aﬃliated Hospital. There were 395   $(72.6\%)$   men and 149   $(27.4\%)$  women. The average age was   $61.36\,\pm\,13.91$   years. After strict neurological examination, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), IS was diagnosed according to the Trial of   $\mathrm{Arg}\;10{,}172$   in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria ( 46 ). All of the patients with cerebral hemorrhage, card i oem boli c or unspeciﬁed stroke, neoplastic or intra cranial space-occupying lesion were excluded. Clinical data such as medical history, demographic characteristics and lifestyle factors were recorded on a pre-designed form and managed with Excel software. Alcohol information included questions about the number of liangs (about   $50\,\mathrm{g.}$  ) or grams of rice wine, corn wine, rum, beer, or liquor consumed during the preceding 12 months. Alcohol consumption was categorized into subgroups of grams of alcohol per day: 0 (non-drinker),    ${\leq}25$   and    ${>}25$  . Smoking status was categorized into subgroups of cigarettes per day: 0 (non-smoker),  ${\leq}20$   and  ${>}20$  . Routine physical examination of each participant was also performed. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Aﬃliated Hospital, Guangxi Medical University (No. Lunshen 2014-KY-Guoji-001; Mar. 7, 2014) and was strictly conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants signed informed consent before the investigation.  

# Controls  

A control group of 561 healthy subjects was also recruited from our Physical Examination Center. The age structure, sex ratio, and nationality (Han Chinese) were matched between the control and case groups. There were 413   $(73.6\%)$   males and 148   $(26.4\%)$  females. The mean age was   $61.64\pm15.49$   years. All of them were free of coronary heart disease and IS at the time of medical history collection, physical examination, biochemical measurements, and imaging inspection, such as 64-slice computed tomography angiography. The subjects who took medications such as lipidlowering agents,  $\upbeta$   adrenergic-blocking agents, thiazide diuretics, hypoglycemic agents, or hormones were excluded.

# Biochemical Assays  

A fasting venous blood sample of   $5\,\mathrm{{ml}}$   was obtained from each participant. A part sample of   $2\,\mathrm{mol}$   was placed into a glass tube to perform biochemical assays, whereas another part sample of   $3\,\mathrm{{ml}}$   was collected into an anticoagulant tube to extract deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The levels of serum HDL-C (Cholestest N HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, Cholestest LDL; Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), total cholesterol (TC, Tcho-1), TG (TG-LH), apo lipoprotein (Apo) A1 and ApoB (RANDOX Laboratories Ltd., Ardmore, Diamond Road, Crumlin Co. Antrim, United Kingdom, BT29 4QY) in samples were determined using an auto analyzer (Type

# Diagnostic Criteria  

In our Clinical Science Experiment Center, the normal reference values of serum lipid parameters were TC   $(3.10{-}5.17\ \mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L})$  , TG   $(0.56{-}1.70\ \mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L})$  ), HDL-C   $(0.91\mathrm{-}1.81\,\mathrm{\mm}/\mathrm{L})$  , LDL-C

  $(2.70{-}3.20\ \mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{L})$  , ApoA1   $(1.00{-}1.78~\mathrm{g/L})$  , ApoB (0.63–1.14

  $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{L}},}$  ), and ApoA1/ApoB ratio (1.00–2.50) ( 47 ,  48 ). The diagnostic criteria of hyper lipid emi a, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, overweight, and obesity are as follows: (1) Hyper lipid emi a: TC  $>5.17\;\mathrm{mmol/L},$   and/or   $\mathrm{TG}>1.70\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$   ( 47 ,  48 ); (2) Type 2 diabetes: fasting glucose  $\mathrm{(FPG)}\,\geq\,7.0\ \mathrm{mmol/L},\,2\,\mathrm{h}$   mmol/L, 2 h post pr an dial glucose    $\geq11.1\ \mathrm{mmol/L},$  , or self-reported diagnosis of diabetes or use of anti-diabetic medications ( 49 ); (3) Hypertension: systolic blood pressure (SBP)    $\geq\,140\,\mathrm{\mmHg}$   and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP)  $\geq\,90\,\,\mathrm{mmHg}$  , or self-reported diagnosis of hypertension or use of anti hypertensive drugs ( 50 ); (4) Overweight: body mass index (BMI)   $24{-}28\;\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{\bar{m}}^{2}$  ; and (5) Obesity:  $\mathrm{BM}>28\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$    ( 47 ,  48 ).  

# Statistical Analysis  

Statistical software package SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois) was used to ﬁnish the statistical analyses. Pair-wise linkage d is equilibrium (LD) among the SNPs was expressed by    $D'$   and    $r^{2}$    which were determined using the SHEsis software ( 51 ). The frequency of haplotypes was analyzed by means of the algorithms implemented in the PHASE program. Normally distributed quantitative data and qualitative parameters were expressed as mean    $\pm\nobreakspace\mathrm{SD}$   (Non-normally distributed TG levels, medians and interquartile ranges) and percentages, respectively. Allele frequency was determined via direct counting, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was estimated by the standard goodness-of-ﬁt test. The diﬀerences in qualitative variables between the groups were evaluated by the chi-square analyses, whereas the clinical characteristics were tested by the Student’s unpaired    $t.$  -test. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess the

SNP, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA1 and ApoB are the abbreviations of single nucleotide polymorphism, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apo lipoprotein A1 and apo lipoprotein B; respectively.  $P<0.00\,\mathcal{I}$   was considered statistical sign i can ce after the Bonferroni correction (5 SNPs  $\times\,\,7$   serum lipid phenotypes).  

association between genotypes and serum lipid parameters, and a corrected    $P_{-}$  -value was adopted after Bonferroni correction. Several confounding factors including sex, age, BMI, blood pressure, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking were adjusted for the statistical analyses. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between genotypes and the IS risk, and to calculate odds ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   conﬁdence interval   $\it{(95\%}$   CI) after adjusting for potential con founders. The SNP-SNP and haplotypeenvironment interactions on serum lipid levels and the risk of IS were determined by the factorial regression analyses after controlling for potential con founders.  

# RESULTS  

# Clinical Characteristics and Serum Lipid Levels  

The clinical characteristics of the participants are summarized in  Table 1 . There was not sign i cant ly diﬀerent in sex ratio, age structure, the percentages of subjects who smoked cigarettes, and the levels of LDL-C and ApoB between the two groups. The average values of SBP, DBP, pulse pressure, BMI, and TG were higher in IS than in control groups   $\textstyle P\,<\,0.001$   for all), whereas the percentages of subjects who consumed alcohol, the ApoA1/ApoB ratio, and the mean levels of TC, HDL-C and ApoA1 were lower in IS patients than in controls (  $\mathit{(P}\:<\:0.01$  for all).  

# Genotypic and Allelic Frequencies  

The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the 5 SNPs are presented in  Table 2 . All SNPs exhibited the HWE in both patient and control groups   $\mathit{\Delta}P\ >\ 0.05$   for all). The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs11236530 SNP was diﬀerent between IS patients and controls   $(P\,\leq\,0.001$   for each), the rs11236530A allele frequency was higher in IS than in control groups (27.85 vs.   $21.12\%$  ,    $P<0.001]$  ). There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in genotypic and allelic frequencies of the remaining four SNPs.  

# Genotypes and the Risk of IS  

As shown in  Table 3 , the rs11236530 SNP was associated with increased risk of IS   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.45$  ,   $5\%\;{\mathrm{CI}}=1.12{-}1.88$  ,  $P=0.0044$  for dominant model: CA/AA vs. CC; and   $\mathrm{OR}=1.41$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=$  1.14–1.74,  $P=0.0015$   for log-additive model: A vs. C). But no association was found in the remaining 4 SNPs.  

# Haplotype Frequencies and the Risk of IS  

Moderate LD among the rs600626, rs609379 and rs10899104 SNPs within  MOGAT2  region (SNPs in LD) was noted in controls and patients   $(D'~>~0.5$  ;  Figure 1 ). Haplotype analyses were carried out among the 3 SNPs. Four major haplotypes are listed in  Table 4 . The commonest haplotype is rs600626A-rs609379C-rs10899104T. The rs600626G-rs609379Ars 10899104 G haplotype was associated with decreased risk of IS (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}=0.67$  ,  $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}=0.48–0.93$  ,  $P=0.018$  ).  

# Genotypes and Serum Lipid Levels in Controls  

As described in Table 5 , the average serum HDL-C concentrations were diﬀerent among the rs11236530 genotypes (  $\textstyle P<0.001$  ;    $P<0.001$   was considered statistical sign i can ce after the Bonferroni correction,   $5\;\mathrm{SNPs}\,\times\,7$   serum lipid phenotypes). Serum HDL-C concentrations in the rs 11236530 A allele carriers were lower than those in the rs 11236530 A allele non-carriers.

The abbreviations of SNP, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA1 and ApoB respresent single nucleotide polymorphism, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apo lipoprotein A1 and apo lipoprotein B; respectively.  $P_{I}<0.005$   was considered statistical sign i can ce after the Bonferroni correction (5  $S N P S\times2$  risk factors).  

# SNP-Smoking/Drinking Interactions on Serum Lipid Levels  

The interaction  $P$  - value   $(P_{\mathrm{I}})$   of SNP-smoking/drinking on serum lipid concentrations in control group is listed in  Table 6 . The rs11236530, rs3060 and rs10899104 SNPs interacted with s moking to inﬂuence serum ApoB levels   $(P_{\mathrm{I}}<0.004{-}0.001;P$   $P_{\mathrm{I}}<$  0.005 was considered statistical sign i can ce after the Bonferroni correction:   $5~\mathrm{NPS}\,\times\,2$   risk factors;  Figure 2 ). The rs11236530 and  $\mathrm{r}s3060~\mathrm{SNPS}$   interacted with alcohol to aﬀect serum HDL-C concentrations   $(P_{\mathrm{I}}<0.004{-}0.001$  ;  Figure 3 ).  

# SNP-Smoking/Drinking Interactions on the Risk of IS  

As presented in  Table 7 , the SNPs did not interact with smoking or drinking to inﬂuence the risk of IS (  $P_{\mathrm{I}}>0.005$   for all).  

# Haplotype-Smoking/Drinking Interactions on the Risk of IS  

The haplotype-smoking interaction on the risk of IS was not detected in the present study.

# DISCUSSION  

The major results of the present study are as follows: (1) Both genotype and allele frequencies of the rs11236530 SNP were diﬀerent between IS and control groups, the rs 11236530 CA/AA genotypes and A allele frequencies were higher in IS patients than in controls. (2) The rs11236530 SNP was associated with increased risk of IS (CA/AA  vs . CC,   $\mathrm{OR}=1.45$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=1.12-$  1.88,  $P=0.0044)$  ). (3) The rs600626G-rs609379A-rs10899104G haplotype decreased the risk of IS (adjusted   $\mathrm{{OR}=0.67}$  ,   $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.48–0.93$  ,    $P=0.018)$  ). (4) Serum HDL-C concentrations in controls were diﬀerent among the rs11236530 genotypes, the rs 11236530 A allele carriers had lower HDL-C levels than the rs11236530A allele non-carriers. (5) The rs11236530, rs3060 and rs10899104 SNPs interacted with cigarette  s moking to inﬂuence

serum ApoB levels, whereas the rs11236530 and rs3060 SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption to aﬀect serum HDLC levels   $(P_{\mathrm{I}}\ <\ 0.004{-}0.001)$  ). (6) Several haplotype-alcohol consumption interactions on the risk of IS were also observed. The rs600626G-rs609379A-rs10899104G-alcohol   $(\mathrm{{OR}\,=\,0.41}$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}=0.22–0.76)$   and rs600626G-rs609379C-rs10899104Talcohol   $(\mathrm{OR}=0.12$  ,   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}=0.04–0.36)$   interactions decreased the risk of IS.  

The genotype and allele frequencies of the  DGAT2-MOGAT2 SNPs in diﬀerent populations are not well-known. A previuos large meta-analysis of lipid phenotypes with the use of a

dense gene-centric approach showed that the rs 11236530 A allele frequency was  $42.46\%$   ( 28 ). The frequencies of  $\mathrm{r}\mathrm{s}3060\mathrm{TT}$  , TC and CC genotypes in Chinese patients with dys lipid emi a were 43.6, 41.0, and   $15.4\%$   ( 45 ) or 51.1, 40.5, and   $8.4\%$   ( 52 ); respectively. In the International 1,000 Genomes database (https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/variation/tools/1000 genomes/), the rs 11236530 A allele frequency was   $16.15\%$   in African Carribbean individuals in Barbados (ACB);   $13.93\%$   in Americans of African Ancestry in the Southwestern USA (ASW);   $9.88\%$   in Bengali from Bangladesh (BEB);   $25.27\%$   in Chinese Dai in X is huang bann a, China (CDX);  $10.10\%$   in Utah residents (CEPH) with Northern and Western European Ancestry (CEU);  $20.39\%$   in Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB);   $16.67\%$   in Southern Han Chinese (CHS);   $5.85\%$   in Colombians from Medellin, Colombia (CLM);

  $11.62\%$   in Esan in Nigeria (ESN);   $6.57\%$   in Finnish in Finland

 (FIN);   $9.89\%$   in British in England and Scotland (GBR); and   $8.25\%$   in Gujarati Indian from Houston, Texas (GIH). The rs3060C, rs600626G, rs609379A, and rs10899104G allele frequencies were also diﬀerent in the above mentioned ethnic groups. In the Chinese populations, the rs3060C, rs600626G, rs609379A, and rs 10899104 G allele frequencies in CDX, CHB and CHS were 27.96, 22.30, and   $20.48\%$  ; 23.66, 22.33, and

  $20.00\%$  ; 19.89, 15.53, and   $20.48\%$  ; and 24.73, 21.84, and

  $24.29\%$  ; respectively. In the current study, we found that the rs 11236530 CA/AA genotype and A allele frequencies were higher in IS than in control groups. These ﬁndings suggest that

some  DGAT2-MOGAT2  SNPs may be diﬀerent in distinct races, ethnic groups, or populations. We found that the prevalence of the rs 11236530 A allele was higher in Chinese than in Europeans or African. These results might also be a reasonable explanation for the distinct prevalence of IS between Chinese and European or African.  

The association between the  DGAT2-MOGAT2  SNPs and IS remains unknown. In the present study, we showed, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, that the rs11236530 SNP increased the risk of IS in diﬀerent genetic models. In addition, we also found moderate LD among the rs600626, rs609379 and rs10899104 SNPs in our study populations. The rs600626Grs609379A-rs 10899104 G haplotype decreased the risk of IS (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.67$  ,  $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}=0.48–0.93$  ,    $P=0.018]$  ). Several haplotypes interacted with alcohol consumption to inﬂuence the risk of IS. The rs600626G-rs609379A-rs 10899104 G-alcohol  $\mathrm{{OR}=0.41}$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}=0.22–0.76)$   and rs600626G-rs609379C- rs 10899104 T-alcohol   $(\mathrm{OR}\ \ =\ \ 0.12\$  ,   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\ =\ 0.04–0.36)$  ) interactions decreased the risk of IS. These results suggest that the rs11236530 SNP may be a new genetic marker for ischemic cardiovascular disease.  

The potential association between the  DGAT2-MOGAT2 SNPs and blood lipid concentrations in humans has not been well-elucidated. In a previous large-scale gene-centric metaanalysis across 32 studies, Asselbergs et al. ( 28 ) showed that the rs11236530 SNP decreased HDL-C levels in the European populations. Although the rs3060 SNP was not associated with blood lipid traits in previous GWASes ( 19 ,  20 ,  22 ), the variant allele was sign i cant ly associated with liver fat content changes in response to niacin treatment ( 45 ). Liver fat content was lower in subjects with two copies of the variant allele than in the homozygous wild-type. The rs3060 SNP was not related to the baseline liver fat content or other parameters, or changes in body weight, visceral adipose tissue, plasma TG, free fatty acid, insulin, or liver enzyme level. In the current study, we revealed that serum HDL-C concentrations in controls were sign i cant ly diﬀerent among the rs11236530 genotypes, the subjects with rs 11236530 CA/AA genotypes had lower HDL-C concentrations than those with the rs 11236530 CC genotype. In addition, this study is the ﬁrst to report that the rs11236530, rs3060 and rs10899104 SNPs interacted with cigarette  s moking to inﬂuence serum ApoB concentrations; and the rs11236530 and rs3060 SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption to aﬀect serum HDL-C concentrations.

This investigation may have several limitations. First, the number of both control and patient groups was relatively small compared with some previous genetic studies. Second, many IS patients were taking some drugs that may aﬀect serum lipid proﬁles. Therefore, we could not determine the association between the  DGAT2-MOGAT2  SNPs and serum lipid levels in IS group. Third, although several factors were adjusted for the statistical analyses, some clinical characteristics were diﬀerent between the two groups. Finally, there are still many unmeasured environmental and genetic factors and their interactions in this study. Thus, further large studies are needed to conﬁrm our ﬁndings.  

# CONCLUSION  

This study shows that the rs 11236530 A allele frequency was higher in IS patients than in controls. The rs11236530 SNP and rs600626G-rs609379C-rs 10899104 T haplotype carriers in nondrinker were associated with increased risk of IS, whereas the rs600626G-rs609379A-rs 10899104 G haplotype; and the rs600626G-rs609379A-rs10899104G-alcohol and rs600626Grs609379C-rs 10899104 T-alcohol interactions were associated with decreased risk of IS. The rs 11236530 A allele carriers in controls had lower HDL-C levels than the rs 11236530 A allele non-carriers. The rs11236530, rs3060 and rs10899104 SNPs interacted with cigarette smoking to inﬂuence serum ApoB levels, and the rs11236530 and rs3060 SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption to aﬀect serum HDL-C levels. These results suggest that the rs11236530 SNP may be a new genetic marker for IS. The association between the rs11236530 SNP and the IS risk may be partly explained by decreasing serum HDL-C levels in our study populations.
