# Abstract  

The association between matrix metal lo protein as e ‐ 9 (MMP ‐ 9) gene rs3918242 polymorphism and the risk of stroke has been investigated, but the findings have been found to be contradictory. Thus, this association was assessed by meta ‐ analysis. Potential studies were searched throughout PubMed, Embase, and CNKI. Pooled odds ratios and   $95\%$   confidence intervals were calculated. Sixteen original studies analyzing this association were included, involving 3647 stroke patients and 3685 unrelated controls. It was confirmed that MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism increased the risk of stroke. Stratification analysis of ethnicity revealed an increased risk of stroke among Asians, but not among Caucasians. Subgroup analysis by the type of stroke showed that MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism increased the risk of ischemic stroke. Sensitivity analysis did not draw different findings. In conclusion, MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism increases the risk of stroke.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION  

Stroke is one of the major causes of death among the elderly.   Stroke can be mainly divided into ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. The risk of stroke can be intensified by high blood cholesterol, tobacco addiction, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus.   Vascular inflammation is pivotal in the occurrence of stroke.   It is implied that stroke might be very likely induced by some genetic factors. Therefore, it is urgent to investigate the genetic variants that trigger stroke.  

Matrix metal lo protein as es (MMPs) are critical in many biological processes diseases (eg, atheromatous plaque, arthritis, tumors, and tissue ulceration) and (eg, wound healing, embryo genesis, tissue reconstruction, and blood vessel formation).   The human MMP ‐ 9 gene on chromosome 20q12 ‐ q13, composed of 13 exons and 12 introns, may contribute to the penetration of leucocytes, movement of vascular smooth muscle cells, and de stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques.   MMP ‐ 9 expression is up regulated in serum and brain tissues of stroke patients.   Therefore, the hypothesis that MMP ‐ 9 may be a candidate gene for stroke susceptibility is reasonable.  

The association between MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 (1562C/T) polymorphism and stroke risk has been explored extensively.   However, the existing findings are controversial and indefinite because of clinical differences, ethnic differences, and small sample sizes. To accurately identify the genetic role of this single ‐ nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in stroke development, we conducted this systematic meta ‐ analysis to clarify the relationship between MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism and stroke risk.

# 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# 2.1 | Identification of eligible studies and data extraction  

Literatures were comprehensively searched throughout PubMed, Embase, and CNKI to retrieve the genetic association studies of stoke. The following terms were used:  “ matrix metal lo protein as e ‐ 9, ” “ MMP ‐ 9, ” “ gelatinase, ” “ SNP, ” “ polymorphism, ” “ variant, ” “ stroke, ”

 “ apoplexy, ” “ ischemic stroke, ” “ hemorrhagic stroke, ”

 “ cerebro vascular disease, ” “ cerebral infarction, ”  and

 “ brain infarction. ”  Additional studies (eg, references of identified studies) were manually screened. All studies were carefully selected up to October 31, 2016. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) evaluation into the association between MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism and stroke, (b) target at humans, and (c) genotype data for the calculation of odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\%$  confidence intervals (CIs). Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) duplicate; (b) lack of genotype data; (c) not case ‐ control study; and (d) case ‐ only study. The follow- ing information was carefully extracted from each eligible study: author, year of publication, ethnicity of study population based on the continent of origin, type of stroke, source of controls, numbers of patients and controls, and genotype methods.  

# 2.2 | Evaluation of statistical associations  

All statistical analyses were performed on Stata 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). The strength of association between MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism and stroke risk was assessed by using ORs and   $95\%$   CIs. Stratification analyses were conducted by ethnicity, source of control, and type of stroke.    $P<0.05$   was

considered significant. A random ‐ effect model was used in the case of  $I^{2}>50\%$  . 29   Pooled ORs and   $95\%$   CIs were calculated using allele, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous, and dominant genetic models. The power of this meta ‐ analysis was calculated with a significant value of 0.05.   Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the study quality based on the NOS.   All disagreements were discussed and resolved with consensus.  

# 2.3 | Evaluation of publication bias and heterogeneity  

Potential publication bias was assessed by Begg ’ s and Egger ’ s linear regression tests,   with the significance level at  $P<0.05$  . Sensitivity analysis was performed by omitting the studies one by one to evaluate the effect on heterogeneity test and the stability of the overall results.  

# 3 | RESULTS  

# 3.1 | Characteristics of included studies  

In total, 91 studies were identified preliminarily throughout PubMed, Embase, and CNKI. Among them, 14 duplicates and 51 irrelevant studies were excluded. The remaining 26 studies were sent to a full ‐ text review, which excluded three studies investigating other polymorphisms, two studies focusing on other diseases, two meta ‐ analyses and three non – case ‐ control studies. Finally, 16 studies were included, with the characteristics summarized in Table 1. Selection for eligible studies is illustrated in Figure 1. The Newcastle ‐ Ottawa scale (NOS) scores of the included studies varied

from six to eight stars, indicating that these studies were qualified methodological ly.  

# 3.2 | Meta ‐ analysis of rs3918242 polymorphism  

General analysis shows that MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism significantly increases stroke risk (T vs C: OR and  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,{=}\,1.33$   [1.12, 1.59]; TT vs CC: 1.99 [1.20, 3.29]; CT vs CC: 1.22 [1.01, 1.47];   $\mathrm{TT+CT}$   vs CC: 1.31 [1.10, 1.57], Figure 2; TT vs   $\mathbf{CT}+\mathbf{CC}$  : 1.89 [1.14, 3.14], Table 2; all  $P\!<\!0.05)$  ). Stratification analysis by ethnicity shows that a significant association between rs3918242 polymorphism and increased stroke risk only among Asians (Table 3), but not among Caucasians   $\mathrm{TT}+\mathrm{CT}$   vs CC, Figure 3). Stratification analysis by the type of stroke   $\left(\mathrm{TT}+\mathrm{CT}\right.$   vs CC, Figure 4) shows that MMP ‐ 9 rs3918242 polymorphism is correlated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (Table 3).  

Sensitivity analysis was assessed by removing one study each time in every genetic model. The pooled ORs for the effects of MMP ‐ 9 rs3918242 polymorphism on stroke risk confirm the stability and reliability of our data (T vs C, Figure 5). Neither Egger ’ s nor Begg ’ s tests   $(\mathrm{TT}+\mathrm{CT}$   vs CC, Figure 6) revealed any significant publication bias regarding MMP ‐ 9 rs3918242 polymorphism (data not shown).  

# 4 | DISCUSSION  

This meta ‐ analysis shows that MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Stratification analysis by ethnicity shows that this significant association only exists among Asians. Stratification analysis by the type of stroke indicates that this association is significant only for ischemic stroke.

The effects of MMPs on the pathogen es is of vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, and stroke have been reported.   A higher MMP ‐ 9 expression level is positively associated with stroke risk.   The rs3918242 in MMP ‐ 9 gene is associated with the precursors of stroke, such as vascular inflammation and at hero sclerotic plaque. Several studies report inconsistent findings of the association between the MMP ‐ 9 rs3918242 polymorphism and stroke risk.   The correlation between MMP ‐ 9 rs3918242 polymorphism and an increased risk of ischemic stroke has been reported by some studies among Chinese populations,   but not from other studies on Caucasian populations.   We hypothesize that the above conflict between studies on Chinese and Caucasian ethnicities may be attributed to the distribution of MMP ‐ 9 gene functional polymorphism among different races. However, we cannot exclude the factors contributing to the inconsistency: including the inadequate statistical power of the single study, clinical heterogeneity, small sample size, or uncorrected multiple hypothesis testing, which should be further validated in the future.  

This meta ‐ analysis was performed to solve the shortcomings and inconsistency of the included studies and decrease the likelihood of random errors leading to false ‐ positive or false ‐ negative association. It is found that MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism is associated with the increased risk of stroke. Two meta ‐ analyses had been conducted to investigate the association between MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism and stroke susceptibility, involving only three studies 33   and seven studies with 1624 cases and 1525 controls.   However, no significant association between rs3918242 polymorphism and stroke risk was found, which was inconsistent with our finding. We think their findings are with inadequate statistical power because of limited sample sizes. As is well known, the association between gene SNPs and disorders is largely dependent on the sample sizes. In addition, several new studies have been published after these two meta ‐ analyses. Our meta ‐ analysis included 16 studies   with a larger sample size (3647 cases and 3685 controls). In addition, the power analysis of the current study indicated that the power to detect the effect of rs3918242 polymorphism on stroke risk was   $96.9\%$  , or an OR of 1.31. Sensitivity analysis indicated our data about this SNP was reliable and robust. Fan et  $\mathrm{{a}l^{34}}$    reported subgroup analyses by ethnicity, the source of controls, or type of stroke and did not identify any association. On the contrary, our meta ‐ analysis found positive results among these analyses.  

Nevertheless, this meta ‐ analysis has some potential limitations. (a) Due to data limitation, stratification analysis did not involve age, sex, or other potential factors. (b) The estimates of confounding factors were not adjusted, which might interfere with the final results. (c) Due to the lack of data, potential gene ‐ environment or gene ‐ gene interaction was not considered. (d) High heterogeneity was found in many genetic models.

(e) The conclusions regarding hemorrhagic stroke and mixed stroke should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes. (f) This meta ‐ analysis only focused on one SNP of the MMP ‐ 9 gene.  

In conclusion, this meta ‐ analysis confirms that MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism is associated with the increased risk of stroke. Nevertheless, further large ‐ size studies are needed to validate whether MMP ‐ 9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism accounts for stroke risks in other ethnic groups.
