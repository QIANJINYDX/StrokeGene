# Abstract  

Background:  Endothelin (ET)‐1 is a potent va so constrictor peptide produced by en‐ dothelial cells and associated with vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.  Lys198Asn is a single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of gene encoding ET‐1 (EDN1).  It is hypothesized that it might have a role in altering ET‐1 and ultimately leading to  vascular dysfunction and ischemic stroke. We therefore conducted a meta‐analysis  to investigate the association between Lys198Asn polymorphism of EDN1 gene and  susceptibility of ischemic stroke.  

Methods:  This meta‐analysis was conducted according to the guidance of the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA)  statement. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science, J‐ STAGE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for relevant studies.  The association between Lys198Asn polymorphism and ischemic stroke sus ce pti bil‐ ity was evaluated by calculating the pooled ORs and   $95\%$   CIs.  

Results:  Our analysis included 1,291 cases and 2,513 controls. Meta‐analysis estab‐ lished a significant association between Lys198Asn SNP of EDN1 gene and ischemic  stroke when assuming either recessive model (OR: 1.30;   $95\%$   CI: 1.02–1.65;  $p=.03$  ;   $I^{2}=41\%)$  ) or dominant model (OR: 1.48;   $95\%$   CI: 1.24–1.76;  $p<.001$  ;  $I^{2}=61\%.$  ). There  was no evidence of publication bias in either of the recessive model (Egger test:   $p=.23$  ; Begg test:  $p=.85.$  ) or dominant model (Egger test:  $p=.79$  ; Begg test:  $p=.85,$  ).  A subgroup analysis based on subtypes of ischemic stroke showed that Lys198Asn  SNP was only associated with large vessel infarction but not with lacunar infarction  caused by small vessel disease. A subgroup analysis based on ethnicity revealed that  the Lys198Asn polymorphism of the EDN1 gene was associated with ischemic stroke  only in Caucasians.  

Conclusions:  The present meta‐analysis suggests that Lys198Asn polymorphism of  EDN1 gene is associated with an increased risk for ischemic stroke.

# 1  |  BACKGROUND  

Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally and leading cause  of long‐term disability in both developing and developed countries.  Approximately  $70\%$   of new strokes are ischemic in origin,  $51\%$   stroke  death, and   $58\%$   of stroke disability‐adjusted life years are because  of ischemic stroke (Feigin et al., 2016). A complex interaction be‐ tween modifiable and non‐modifiable conventional risk factors and  genetic factors could be behind the pathogen es is of ischemic stroke  (Boehme, Esenwa, & Elkind, 2017). Genetic influence on the patho‐ genesis of ischemic stroke has been established by epidemiological  and animal studies (Hassan, 2000; Humphries & Morgan, 2004), and  influences are polygenic whereby multiple genes exert a small influ‐ ence or risk on phenotype.  

The basis of ischemic stroke is the reduction in cerebral blood  flow caused by alteration in structure and function of the blood  vessel wall, which begins with changes in the structure and func‐ tion of the endothelium (Widmer & Lerman, 2014). Endothelin  (ET)‐1 is a potent va so constrictor peptide produced by endothe‐ lial cells and has been implicated as an important factor in the  development of vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular disease  (Böhm & Pernow, 2007). In addition to va so constriction, ET‐1 is  involved in pro‐inflammatory actions, stimulation of free radical  formation, platelet activation, and pro life rat ive effects (Böhm 

 & Pernow, 2007). Some studies have found high plasma level 

 (Estrada et al., 2017; Sapira, Cojocaru, Lilios, & Grigorian, 2010;  Ziv et al., 1992) and high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) level (Lampl et  al., 1997) of ET‐1 in ischemic stroke patients. In a study by Dai et  al. (2017), injection of ET‐1 in rhesus monkey induced transient  ischemic attack. Thus ET‐1 might have a role in development of  ischemic stroke.  

The human endothelin‐1 gene (EDN1) contains 5 exons and spans   ${\sim}6.8~\mathrm{kb}$   of genomic Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and is located on  chromosome   $6{\mathsf{p}}23{\mathsf{-p}}24$  . Transcription of the human EDN1 gene  yields a  $2.8–\mathsf{k b}$   messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) that encodes a  212‐amino acid precursor protein, pre‐pro‐ET‐1 (PPET; Yanagisawa  & Masaki, 1989). Furin‐like proteases cleave PPET to a 38‐amino acid  protein called big ET‐1. The final cleavage step is mediated by endo‐ thelin‐converting enzymes that cleave big ET‐1 into 21‐amino acid  active ET‐1 (Figure 1). K198N or Lys198Asn or rs5370 is a single‐nu‐ cleotide polymorphism (SNP) of EDN1 gene, located in its 5th exon  (Tanaka, Kamide, Takiuchi, Miyata, & Kawano, 2005). This SNP leads  to G‐to‐T trans version coding for a lysine (K) to asparagine (N) amino  acid substitution at amino acid 198 of PPET (Tanaka et al., 2005).  This SNP might have a role in altering ET‐1 and ultimately leading  to vascular dysfunction and ischemic stroke. Some studies have  found that Lys198Asn is associated with ischemic stroke (Dubovyk,  Oleshko, Harbuzova, & Ataman, 2018; Li Wei et al., 2009; Yamaguchi  et al., 2006; Zhang & Sui, 2014). However, few studies have failed  to demonstrate this relationship in ischemic stroke (Aslan, Gurger,  Atescelik, & Kara, 2017; Gormley, Bevan, Hassan, & Markus, 2005).  Additionally, these studies are limited by their small sample size  (Aslan et al., 2017; Dubovyk et al., 2018; Gormley et al., 2005; Li Wei  et al., 2009; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Zhang & Sui, 2014). Thus, we  conducted a meta‐analysis to investigate the association between  Lys198Asn polymorphism of ET‐1 gene (EDN1) and risk of ischemic  stroke.  

# 2  |  MATERIALS AND METHODS  

This current meta‐analysis was conducted according to the guidance  of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐ Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Liberati et al., 2009).  

# 2.1  |  Literature search  

We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science,  J‐STAGE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for  studies published from January 2000 to September 2018. Searches

were conducted using the keywords “EDN1 polymorphism” or 

 “Endothelin‐1 gene polymorphism” or “rs5370 polymorphism” or 

 “Lys198Asn polymorphism” in combination with “stroke” or “is‐ chemic stroke” or “cerebro vascular disease” or “cerebral infarction.”  Titles and abstracts were screened and the full text of any that  were considered to possibly meet the inclusion criteria were then  obtained. The cited references of retrieved articles were manually  checked to identify any additional eligible trials. Two authors (GN  and RO) screened and retrieved reports and excluded irrelevant  studies. When uncertainty about eligibility criteria arose, it was  solved by discussion with all the authors.  

# 2.2  |  Eligibility criteria  

We included studies that were conducted on human subjects, and  the studies were searched without any limitations on language. In  this meta‐analysis, all included studies met the following criteria: (a)  case–control studies focused on the association between rs5370/ Lys198Asn polymorphism and ischemic stroke susceptibility, (b)  patients with ischemic stroke were diagnosed with neuro imaging  confirmed by neurologist, and (c) there were sufficient data of the  genotypes in the case–control groups to evaluate the ORs and  $95\%$    CIs. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) publications with over‐ lapping cases and controls from the similar study, (b) no genotypic  data available, and (c) publications with patients with card i oem boli c  stroke or hemorrhagic stroke.  

# 2.3  |  Data abstraction and assessment of  methodological quality  

The relevant data from each study were independently extracted  by two reviewers (GN and RO) using a standardized, structured  form. Extracted data included the first author, type of design, site  of study, patient ethnicity, year of publication, sample size of cases  and controls, control design, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, source of  DNA, genotyping method, data of the genotypes in the case–control  groups, type of ischemic stroke, mean age of participants, mean BMI  of participants, and male to female ratio.  

The methodological quality of each study was assessed inde‐ pendently by two reviewers (GN and RO) using the parameters  previously used by Kumar et al. (2016) In this scale, following sec‐ tions were included for assessment of methodological quality: rep‐ resent at ive ness of cases, source of controls, matching of controls,  ascertainment of cases, ascertainment of controls, blinding while  genotyping, genotyping methods, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium,  and association assessment. Maximum score of 2 can be provided  in each section, except source of controls (maximum 3), ascertain‐ ment of controls (maximum 1), blinding while genotyping (maximum  1), and association assessment (maximum 1). Methodological quality  of scale score varies from 0 to 16, in which higher score represents  the better quality and lower score represents the lower quality. Any  discrepancies during data extraction and quality assessment were  resolved by discussion with all the authors.

# 2.4  |  Statistical analysis  

In the majority of selected studies, the authors presented odds  ratio (OR) and   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) for association be‐ tween Lys198Asn polymorphism and ischemic stroke sus ce pti bil‐ ity. In study where OR and  $95\%$   CI was not available, we calculated  the OR and   $95\%$   CI comparing the number of genotypes in cases  and controls. The association between Lys198Asn polymorphism  and ischemic stroke susceptibility was evaluated by calculating  the pooled ORs and  $95\%$   CIs. Heterogeneity between the included  studies was determined using Cochran's   $Q$   test and   $I^{2}$   test. The  presence of   $p$   values above 0.1 or  $I^{2}$   more than   $50\%$   was consid‐ ered as an indicator of significant heterogeneity. When there was  no heterogeneity, we selected the fixed effects model and, in the  presence of significant heterogeneity, we selected the random ef‐ fects model to calculate the effect size. Genotypes at each locus  were coded as follows: TT  $=$  mutant homozygotes, TG  $=$   heterozy‐ gotes, and   $\mathtt{G G}=$   wild homozygotes. Two genetic models were ex‐ amined, including dominant model   $\mathsf{T T+T G}$   vs. GG), and recessive  model (TT vs.   $\mathsf{G G}+\mathsf{T G})$  ). Sensitivity analysis was performed to ex‐ amine the stability of analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed  based on ethnicity and stroke subtype. Meta‐regression was per‐ formed to determine whether methodological quality of study  have role in effect size associated with Lys198Asn polymorphism.  Egger's linear regression test and Begg's test were used for the  identification of publication biases. Statistical analysis was per‐ formed using comprehensive meta‐analysis software (CMA 3.3;  Biostat, 2014).  

# 3  |  RESULTS  

# 3.1  |  Literature search  

The results of the systematic literature search and selection are  summarized in Figure 2. We identified 364 articles through database  searching and three through reference lists searching. After exclu‐ sion of duplicates, 258 articles remained, and after screening titles  and abstracts, 65 relevant abstracts remained. After application of  inclusion and exclusion criteria, six studies were chosen for final  analysis and the data were extracted.  

# 3.2  |  Study and patient characteristics  

Our research included studies from two continents and five dif‐ ferent countries. Two studies were from China (Li Wei et al., 2009;  Zhang & Sui, 2014) and one study was from Japan (Yamaguchi et al.,  2006), the United Kingdom (Gormley et al., 2005), Turkey (Aslan et  al., 2017), and Ukraine (Dubovyk et al., 2018) each. The publication  date ranged from 2005 (Gormley et al., 2005) to 2018 (Dubovyk et  al., 2018). All included studies had case–control designs. In all in‐ cluded studies, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was achieved in the  control population. Venous blood was the source of DNA in all stud‐ ies. Each study used a unique form of genotyping. Of the six studies,  only three studies matched age and sex for controls (Gormley et al.,  2005; Li Wei et al., 2009; Zhang & Sui, 2014). Four studies did inpa‐ tient recruitment of patient (Aslan et al., 2017; Dubovyk et al., 2018;  Li Wei et al., 2009; Zhang & Sui, 2014) while outpatient recruitment  (Yamaguchi et al., 2006) and community recruitment (Gormley et  al., 2005) was done by one study each. According to quality assess‐ ment tools, the methodological quality of most studies was found  to be moderately high. Table 1 lists the details of the study charac‐ teristics. The patients included in the three studies were Asian (Li  Wei et al., 2009; Yamaguchi et al., 2006; Zhang & Sui, 2014) and in  the remaining three were Caucasian (Aslan et al., 2017; Dubovyk et  al., 2018; Gormley et al., 2005). Two studies recruited small vessel  disease patients and four recruited large vessel disease patients. In  the included studies, the controls had no history of cerebro vascular,  coronary and other at hero sclerotic diseases. Among the cases, the  mean age ranged between 60 and 71 years. Among the controls, the  mean age ranged between 60 and 68 years. All other patient charac‐ teristics can be seen in Table 2.  

# 3.3  |  Meta‐analysis  

In dominant model, there was significant heterogeneity, so we ap‐ plied random‐effects model to estimate pooled ORs and  $95\%$   CIs. In  recessive model, there was no heterogeneity, so we applied fixed‐ef‐ fects model. Meta‐analysis established a significant association be‐ tween Lys198Asn polymorphism of EDN1 gene and ischemic stroke  when assuming either recessive model of inheritance (OR: 1.30;  $95\%$    CI: 1.02–1.65;  $p\,=\,.03$  ;  $I^{2}=41\%,$   or dominant model of inheritance

Forest plot of  the result for dominant model is demonstrated in Figure 4. There  was no evidence of publication bias in either of the recessive model  (Egger test:   $p\,=\,.23$  ; Begg test:   $p\,=\,.85)$  ) or dominant model (Egger  test:  $p=.79$  ; Begg test:  $p=.85,$  ). Funnel plot for detection of publica‐ tion bias in recessive model and dominant model is demonstrated in  Figures 5 and 6, respectively.  

Meta‐regression analysis was used to explore whether the meth‐ odological quality scores of the included studies play an important  role in the association between the Lys198Asn polymorphism of  the EDN1 gene and the risk of ischemic stroke. In recessive model,  we found that quality scores were not significant predictors of the  effect size for the association between Lys198Asn polymorphism  and ischemic stroke risk   $(p=.14)$  . However, in the dominant model,  quality scores were significant predictors of the effect size   $(p=.02)$  .  Meta‐regression plot for recessive model and dominant model is  shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.  

# 3.4  |   Sensitivity test, subgroup analysis, and  meta ‐ regression  

For both models of inheritance, we sequentially excluded one study  from the pooled analysis and recalculated the summary ORs to  check whether the summary ORs were significantly changed. The  recalculated ORs were adamant, indicating the stability of analysis.  

# 4  |  DISCUSSION  

There is growing evidence that genetic factors are involved in the  development of ischemic stroke. This meta‐analysis was designed to  determine an accurate estimate of the association between the EDN1  Lys198Asn SNP and the risk of ischemic stroke. Several studies have  shown an independent association of Lys198Asn SNP of the EDN1  gene and number of diseases such as hypertension (Barath et al.,  2007; Barbeau et al., 2003; Fang, Li, & Ma, 2017; Jin et al., 2003),  obesity (Karita & Sadewa, 2019), obstructive sleep apnea (Diefenbach  

In the recessive model, a subgroup analysis based on subtypes  of ischemic stroke showed that the Lys198Asn SNP of the EDN1  gene was not associated with any  of the subtypes of ischemic  stroke. However, the dominant model showed that Lys198Asn SNP  was associated with large vessel disease. In the  recessive model,  ethnicity‐based subgroup analysis showed that  the Lys198Asn  SNP of the EDN1 gene was not associated with ischemic stroke in  both Caucasians and Asians. However, the dominant model showed

 & Biagini, 2006), diabetes (Li et al., 2008), pulmonary hypertension 

 (Benza et al., 2015), intra ventricular hemorrhage (S zp echt October ,  Gad zi now ski, Seremak‐M rozi kiew i cz, Kur za wi ska, & S zy mankiewicz,  2016), and sub ara ch noid hemorrhage (Foreman et al., 2017; Gallek et  al., 2013). Therefore, the Lys198Asn SNP is considered to be a risk fac‐ tor for cardiovascular disease and cerebro vascular disease. Our meta‐ analysis suggests a significant association of Lys198Asn SNP of EDN1  with ischemic stroke. Our findings are consistent with the results of  most of the included studies.  

Lys198Asn SNP does not belong to the nucleotide sequence en‐ coding the ET‐1 amino acid, but is located near the nucleotide se‐ quence encoding the amino acid adjacent to the carboxy‐terminal  region of PPET (Figure 1), which is removed from PPET by furin‐like  enzyme during post‐translational processing steps (Tanaka et al.,  2005). Considering the location of this SNP, it is unlikely that structural  changes will be made in ET‐1. However, variation in gene regulation is  more important in disease causality than in structural changes in spe‐ cific proteins. Although Lys198Asn does not structurally alter the ET‐1  protein, studies have demonstrated that silent SNP like Lys198Asn can  affect human mRNA synthesis, splicing, processing, stability, trans‐ port, translation, and protein folding (Robert & Pelletier, 2018; Shen &  Basilion, 1999). Furthermore, Lys198Asn SNP can also be co inherited  together with another gene highly associated with ischemic stroke due  to physical proximity or with a highly functional SNP within the EDN1  gene itself, for the same reasons as above, and can structurally alter  ET‐1 (Tanaka et al., 2005). In other words, above‐mentioned SNP and  the causative genetic factor might be in linkage d is equilibrium (Tanaka  et al., 2005). Such SNP may not have influence on disease suscepti‐ bility however they can be an important maker if they coinherit with  other highly disease‐associated gene or with other highly functional  SNP of same gene.

FI G U R E 8  Meta‐regression plot for  dominant model  

In our subgroup analysis, we found that Lys198Asn SNP was  only associated with large vessel infarction but not with lacunar in‐ farction caused by small vessel disease (SVD). This may be due to a  number of issues, including sample size, heterogeneous pathophys‐ iology, and silent SVD. Silent SVD is defined as hyper intensities of  the white matter that correlate with an a symptomatic cerebral in‐ farction. Many cases of lacunar infarction s due to SVD are silent. As  these cases often do not present to the hospital, they are excluded  from the analysis. Complex interactions between genetic and non‐ genetic factors have been reported to play an important role in the  progression of ischemic stroke (Boehme et al., 2017). Ethnicity is  one of the important nongenetic factors. Therefore, we conducted  an ethnicity‐based subgroup analysis. In the recessive model, the  Lys198Asn SNP of the EDN1 gene was not associated with an isch‐ emic stroke in both Asians and Caucasians. However, in dominant  model, the Lys198Asn SNP of the EDN1 gene was associated with  ischemic stroke in Caucasians but not in Asians. In Asians, especially  in Chinese, lacunar infarction s due to SVD are believed to be respon‐ sible for a higher proportion of ischemic stroke than in Caucasians  (Tsai, Thomas, & Sudlow, 2013). Since the Lys198Asn polymorphism  is not associated with lacunar infarction due to SVD, this could be  the reason why the Lys198Asn SNP of the EDN1 gene is not asso‐ ciated with an ischemic stroke in Asians. Yamaguchi et al. (2006) in‐ cluded female patients only for analysis of Lys198Asn SNP and it was  significantly associated with ischemic stroke. Dubovyk et al. (2018)  and Zhang and Sui (2014) calculated separate estimate for male and  female and Lys198Asn SNP was significantly associated with isch‐ emic stroke in both sex. Aslan et al., Gormley et al., and Hang et  al. did not perform sex stratified analysis. Although sex stratified  subgroup analysis could not be performed in our study due to lack  of data, based on former 3 studies it can be said that Lys198Asn is  associated with ischemic stroke in both sexes.  

Our study has several strengths, first of all, this is the first meta‐anal‐ ysis consisting of a large sample (1,291 cases and 2,513 controls) demon‐ strating the association between Lys198Asn polymorphism and ischemic  stroke. We conducted a comprehensive search, which was not only lim‐ ited to English literature but also included one paper published in Chinese  language. Our analysis included patients of both Asian and Caucasian  ethnicity. There was no deviation from Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium  (HWE) in control subjects in all included studies. We performed analysis  in both recessive and dominant model. In recessive model, there was no  evidence of heterogeneity. However, in dominant model, minimal het‐ erogeneity was seen. Based on the subgroup analysis and the meta‐re‐ gression analysis, it was evident that the heterogeneity was due to the  difference in the study population and the methodological quality of the  included studies. Finally, publication bias was not obvious in our analysis.  

There were some limitations in our study. Some studies in‐ cluded in the meta‐analysis had a small sample size and may have  provided inconsistent results due to low statistical power. Among  the included studies, different methodologies were used for ge‐ notyping and the selection of controls. The  haplotype analysis,  which plays a pivotal role in genetic association studies, was not  performed. The gene‐environment interaction and the gene‐gene  interaction were not studied in this meta‐analysis. Owing to the  above limitations, the results of this meta‐analysis should be inter‐ preted with caution.  

# 5  |  CONCLUSION  

Our meta‐analysis suggests a significant association of Lys198Asn  polymorphism of EDN1 gene with ischemic stroke. Lys198Asn  polymorphism might influence on disease susceptibility and can  also be an important marker of risk for ischemic stroke. Large co‐ hort studies with gene–gene and gene–environment interactions  in diverse ethnicity should be conducted to reach more reliable  conclusion.
