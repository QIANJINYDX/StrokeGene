# Abstract  

Objective : In humans, serum IGF1 (s-IGF1) is associated with outcome after ischemic stroke (IS). Therefore variation at the  IGF1  locus could also associate with both IS and s-IGF1. We investigated whether genetic variation at the  IGF1  locus is associated with i) s-IGF1, ii) IS occurrence, iii) IS severity, and iv) post-stroke outcome.  

Design/methods : Patients   $n\!=\!844$  ;  $66\%$   males, mean age 56 years) and community controls   $(n\!=\!668$  ) were included from the Sahl gren ska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS). Post-stroke outcome was evaluated with the modiﬁed Rankin Scale at 3 and 24 months after index stroke, and baseline stroke severity with the Scandinavian Stroke Scale. s-IGF1 was determined in patients and after random selection in 40 of the controls.  

Results : Eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs)were selected in the IGF1 gene.In healthy controls the major allele of rs7136446 was associated with higher s-IGF1, whereas in patients no such association was found. No SNP was associated with IS, nor with stroke severity. After multivariate correction for presence of diabetes, smoking, and hypertension, the major allele of rs7136446 was associated with favorable functional outcome 24-monthspost-stroke(oddsratio  $1.46;9\,5\%\,\mathrm{CI}\,1.09{-}1.96)$  ). Conclusion : Variation in rs7136446 of the  IGF1  gene associates with post-stroke outcome in relatively young IS patients. Also,rs 7136446 associates with s-IGF1 in controls but notinIS, which indicates that IS perturbs a normal genetic impact on s-IGF1 levels.

# Introduction  

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) affects brain plasticity after brain injuries as well as cognition and mood in the healthy brain. In line with this, compounds that affect mood and plasticity after brain injuries also affect local IGF1. Spec i call y, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which affects local brain IGF1 levels in experimental animals  (1) , also improve stroke outcome in humans  (2) . Furthermore, circulating serum IGF1 (s-IGF1) is associated with better recovery after ischemic stroke (IS)  (3, 4) . Circulating s-IGF1 is regulated by growth hormone from the pituitary, but also by other factors such as age, metabolic state, and possibly physical activity  (5, 6) . Spec i call y, s-IGF1 is lower in higher ages and in subjects with the metabolic syndrome, whereas physical activity is at least partially associated with higher s-IGF1. These factors act on s-IGF1 via degradation/stability and on  de novo synthesis of IGF1 protein. Part of this is determined by primary transcriptional mechanisms in the  IGF1  gene locus. Variations at the  IGF1  gene locus include several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and a 192 base-pair cytosine–adenine repeat polymorphism (192 bp CA-repeat) in the promoter region. The absence of the 192 bp CA-repeat is associated with lower levels of s-IGF1  (7) , an increased risk of IS and a lower longterm survival after IS  (8) . This variant also shows association with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetes  (7) . Another study reported an association between rs2229765 in the IGF1 receptor gene ( IGF1R ) and IS  (9) . However, to our knowledge, no other genetic variants in the  IGF1  or  IGF1R  genes have been investigated in relation to IS occurrence or poststroke outcome. The objectives of this study were therefore to investigate whether genetic variation in IGF1  is associated with s-IGF1, IS occurrence, stroke severity, and/or post-stroke outcome.  

# Subjects and methods  

The design of Sahl gren ska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS) has been reported elsewhere  (4, 10) . Brieﬂy, patients (  $<70$   years) with ﬁrst-ever or recurrent acute IS were recruited consecutively at four Stroke Units in western Sweden between 1998 and 2008  $(n\!=\!844$  ). Caucasian community controls   $(n\!=\!668)$  ) from the same geographic area were randomly selected from population registers to match the sex and average age of cases. For the ﬁrst 600 cases, data on functional outcome (modiﬁed Rankin Scale (mRS)) after 3 and 24 months or stroke severity (Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS)) acutely were available. From these subjects, s-IGF1 levels in 407 patients and in 40 randomly selected controls were available from a previous study  (4) . The s-IGF1s of these subjects were analyzed in 2008 in one series of experiments. The frequency of previous hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking was recorded. Participants or next of kin provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Gothenburg. Data and characteristics of each distinct subgroup of samples have been reported previously  (4, 10, 11) , and is also compiled in  Table 1 .  

Genotyping was performed using the Golden Gate assay (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at the SNP&SEQ Technology platform ( www.genotyping.se ), with support from Uppsala University and Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. The genotyping was performed blinded to case/control status. Allele frequencies in the different genotypes are shown in Table 2 . The statistical power of the analysis was calculated using the Genetic Power Calculator at  http:// pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/  $\sim$  purcell/gpc/ (12) .  

Eleven SNPs were selected to capture the common variation in  IGF1  based on data from the HapMap project on the CEU population (release 23)  (13) . The linkage d is equilibrium (LD) blocks were deﬁned using Haploview 4.1 and the method solid spine of LD  $(\mathbb{C}2003–2006$   Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, MA). Nine of the 11 SNPs in  IGF1  were found to be situated in two different LD blocks. The remaining two single SNPs were on either side of these two blocks, making four LD ‘blocks’ in total ( Supplementary Figure 1 , see section on  supplementary data  given at the end of this article). Hence, to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni, the crude  $P$   values were multiplied by four. The ‘Tagger’ program in HaploView was used to select this minimal set of tagSNPs, such that all alleles had a minor allele frequency (MAF)    $>\!0.1$   and were correlated at an  $r^{2}\!>\!0.8$  .  

Statistical evaluation was performed using SPSS versions 16.0 and 17.0 (SPSS, Inc.). Associations between single SNPs and the various factors were investigated using an additive model. Data on functional outcome was dic hot omi zed (favorable outcome, mRS 0–2 vs unfavorable outcome, mRS 3–6).

There are more patients with complete genotype data than those with data on outcome as shown. Data on male (sex), presence of diabetes, hypertension, smoking, stroke severity (according to the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS)), stroke outcome after 3 and 24 months (according to the modiﬁed Ranking scale (mRS), where mRS  $\scriptstyle=0-2$   is a favorable outcome) are presented. Data are shown as mean  $95\%$   CI and  S . D ., or number  $(n)$   and percentage  $(\%)$  . Missing data are presented and based on total numbers included in the study. However, data on percentages of ‘yes’ or ‘favorable outcome’ are based only on the total numbers of subjects with available data.

a Regarding genotype frequencies for each SNP, the percentages are calculated with respect to the total number of genotyped controls or patients (excluding subject with missing data, not available (NA)). For NA the percentages are calculated relative total number of controls or patients.  

Logistic regression was used to assess the relative frequencies of the major allele for each SNP in i) patients and controls, ii) patients surviving the IS, and iii) favorable vs unfavorable outcome. Stroke severity and s-IGF1 were evaluated by linear regression. Odds ratios (OR) or linear coe f ci ents ( B ) and  $95\%$   CIs were with respect to the major allele and age- and sex-corrected. The vascular risk factor con founders of smoking, hypertension, and diabetes were also corrected for in an additional analysis. Assuming a multiplicative genetic model, the ORs that can be detected with  $80\%$   power at a sign i can ce level of   $5\%$   are in the range of 1.23–1.37, with   $\mathrm{MAF}\!=\!0.42\!\!-\!\!0.11$   of the high risk allele. All genotype distributions were compatible with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium   $P\!>\!0.05$  , not shown), and the genotyping success rates were   $95{-}100\%$   ( Table 2 ). The statistical sign i can ce level was    $P\!<\!0.05$  .

# Results  

Baseline characteristics of SAHLSIS are summarized in Table 1 . Age and sex distributions were similar in controls and patients, including the group in which s-IGF1 was analyzed. However, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking were more common in patients, as would be expected. Eleven SNPs were selected to capture the common variation in the  IGF1  gene based on the CEU population from the HapMap project ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). The genotype frequencies in controls and IS patients are presented in  Table 2 .  

The s-IGF1 levels in SAHLSIS have been previously reported  (4)  and were used to investigate whether  IGF1 SNPs are associated with s-IGF1 levels. In the healthy controls, the major allele of rs7136446 was associated with elevated s-IGF1 ( Table 3 ). However, in IS cases, there were no signiﬁcant associations between s-IGF1 and any of the  IGF1  SNPs either acutely or at 3 months post-stroke ( Table 3 ). Additional correction for smoking, hypertension, and diabetes did not alter the associations (not shown).  

To identify possible associations between the  IGF1 SNPs and IS, we performed multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. Occurrence of IS was not associated with any  IGF1  SNP ( Table 4 ). Additional correction for smoking, hypertension, and diabetes did not alter the association (not shown).  

Elevated s-IGF1 has been shown to associate with enhanced post-stroke recovery. In analogy to that, different  IGF1  expression due to genotype variants could be associated with neuro protective action and reduce acute stroke severity. This was evaluated by linear regression analysis of the SSS with respect to IGF1  SNPs ( Table 5 ). Interestingly, there was a trend for the association of the major allele of rs9989002 (i.e. SNP 6) with less severe IS, i.e. higher SSS scores. Additional correction for smoking, hypertension, and diabetes gave similar associations (not shown).  

Association between  IGF1  variants and post-stroke outcome was analyzed for each SNP with regard to favorable functional outcome (i.e.  $\mathrm{mRS}\!=\!0\!-\!2$  ) after 3 and 24 months. The major allele of SNP rs7136446 was associated with favorable functional outcome 24 months after IS, after correction for age, sex, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes (i.e. SNP 7, Table 6 ). However, after Bonferroni adjustment of  $P$   values, no SNP showed association with functional outcome after 3 months ( Table 6 ).  

Another measure of functional outcome after stroke is survival. When survival 3- and 24-months poststroke was analyzed, no association was detected for any of the SNPs (after Bonferroni’s adjustment,  $P\!>\!0.3$  for all SNPs, not shown).  

# Discussion  

This is the ﬁrst study to investigate the genetic variation at the  IGF1  locus in relation to IS and s-IGF1 using a tagSNP approach. The main ﬁnding was that the SNP rs7136446 showed association to functional outcome 24 months after index stroke. In healthy controls, the major allele of the same SNP was associated with higher levels of s-IGF1. In contrast, in IS patients, rs7136446 was not associated with s-IGF1. For the major allele of rs9989002, there was a trend toward an association with less initial stroke severity. None of the SNPs analyzed were associated with occurrence of IS compared with controls.  

Here, we present the novel data that functional independence (mRS 0–2) 24 months after index stroke is associated with the major allele of rs7136446. A similar trend was observed 3 months after index stroke, however this did not withstand correction for multiple testing (crude,    $P\!=\!0.029$   and adjusted,  $P\!=\!0.116$  ). If this SNP is associated with post-stroke recovery, one would expect the association to increase with time after stroke. Indeed, this is what we observed.

Linear coe f ci ents   $(B)$   and  $95\%$   CIs are calculated with respect to the major allele corrected for age and sex. The    $B$   value is expressed so that a positive value represents elevated s-IGF1 in the major allele.

Crude  $P$   values are adjusted for multiple comparisons according to Bonferroni as shown.

MAF are shown in the analyses with logistic regression. ORs and  $95\%$   CIs are calculated with respect to the major allele corrected for age and sex. For IS control/patient comparisons, an  $\mathsf{O R}>1$   represents an increased frequency of the major allele in the controls (i.e. associates with protection against IS). 
![](images/94ed0235c24040b4aeb29d7fb87d6799b1cbf8241f9780a4a6bfa8e32da1d447.jpg)  
Both crude and  $P$   values adjusted for multiple comparisons according to Bonferroni are shown.  

The magnitude of association is moderate   $(\mathrm{OR}\,\sim\!1.5)$  , but still this SNP is probably of potential sign i can ce in relation with IS because the same SNP is associated with endogenous s-IGF1. Statistical correction for the confounding covariates cannot adjust for the presence of a speciﬁc SNP which has been presented life-long. However, covariate correction can be used to test whether an association is mediated by the con founders. If vascular diseases were to mediate the effect of rs713446 on outcome, the association would be weaker after correction and  vice versa . Therefore, the increased strength of association between rs713446 and outcome after correction for vascular risk factors indicates an association that is primarily independent of vascular con founders.  

Previously, it was shown that another measure of outcome, namely survival, is affected by genetic variation in  IGF1 . Spec i call y, increased death rates after IS was reported in non-carriers of the 192 bp CA-repeat  (8) . We did not ﬁnd any statistically signiﬁcant associations between any SNP and survival. However, in contrast to the aforementioned study, SAHLSIS is a study of relatively young stroke sufferers (mean age 56 years). Therefore, the number of deceased patients after 3 and 24 months is relatively low (1.2 and  $4.1\%$   respectively). Thus, the lack of association may simply reﬂect an overall lack of power regarding survival in this analysis.  

Higher s-IGF1 concentrations were associated with the major allele of rs7136446 in healthy controls in this study. This is opposite to what was reported in a study that included only healthy, pre menopausal female participants, wherein the major alleles of rs7136446 and rs9989002, both analyzed in our study, were associated with slightly   $(5{-}7\%)$   lower s-IGF1 levels  (14) . Verheus  et al . did not, however, correct for multiple testing in the analysis of 16 SNPs, and also the found differences in s-IGF1 were quite small in magnitude.  

Interestingly, the major allele of rs7136446 has recently been associated with maximal muscle force production in 148 Finnish males  (15) . One could speculate that patients with higher maximal muscle force may recover muscle strength faster, and thus gain better functional independence. This would be compatible with our results, but of course primary neuronal mechanisms could also account for the association to outcome.  

In control subjects, circulating s-IGF1 was   $37\%$  higher (not shown) in the most common genotype than in the least common genotype. However, this association was not present at all in the patients. Although the power to detect differences in the healthy control group was lower   $(n\!=\!40)$  ) than that in patients  $(n\!=\!407)$  ), the associations appear genuine as we corrected for multiple comparisons ( Table 3 ). As

Linear coe f ci ents  $(B)$   and  $95\%$   CIs are calculated with respect to the major allele corrected for age and sex. For stroke severity the  $B$   value is expressed so that a positive value represents less severe IS in the major allele.

Crude  $P$   values are adjusted for multiple comparisons according to Bonferroni as shown. a After additional correction for con founders (smoking, hypertension, and diabetes) and Bonferroni’s adjustment, this analysis reached statistical sign i can ce  $\!{\cal P}\!{=}!0.049$  , OR 1.46,  $95\%$   CI 1.09–1.96).  $P\!<\!0.05$   values after Bonferroni adjustment are in bold.  

s-IGF1 is regulated by environmental factors  (5) , this may indicate that IS  per se  strongly affects the normal impact of this SNP on s-IGF1. Indeed, after experimental IS, local IGF1 in the brain is up regulated  (16) . As the blood–brain barrier is often injured after IS a local increase of IGF1 may disseminate into the circulation. In this way IS  per se  may be such a strong regulator of IGF1 synthesis, that a normal endogenous association between rs7136446 and s-IGF1 disappears.  

While speciﬁc SNPs were associated with either stroke severity, stroke outcome, or s-IGF1, we did not observe any statistically signiﬁcant associations between IS patients and controls in terms of frequency of the IGF1  SNPs variations. This analysis is considered to be an indirect assessment of the relative risk of being afﬂicted by IS comparing genotypes of IS patients and healthy controls. This is in contrast to an earlier study which reported an association between non carriers of a 192 bp CA-repeat in the  IGF1  promoter and risk of IS  (8) . Similarly, the absence of the CA-repeat has been associated with MI, as well as with lower levels of s-IGF1  (7) . The tagSNP rs7965399 is in LD with the 192 bp CA-repeat  (17) ; however it is uncommon in subjects of Caucasian origin (MAF 0.02, HapMap). Therefore, it did not meet the tagSNP selection criteria and was not included in this study. Two other SNPs, rs7956547 and rs2162679, have been reported to associate with MI in a Japanese study of 320 patients (18) , but these two SNPs did not display signiﬁcant associations with IS in this study. Notably, the associations with MI were not corrected for multiple testing of six SNPs, and are therefore uncertain.  

Methodological and statistical strengths of this study include consecutive recruitment of well-characterized and relatively young IS cases and population-based controls. This, in combination with the very high hospitalization rate   $(84{-}95\%)$   for stroke (especially  $<70$  years)inSweden  (19) , makes selection bias unlikely. In addition, few patients were lost to the follow-up. Weaknesses include the relatively small sample size and lack of replication in another geographic area. Although the associations we report are relatively weak,itshouldbe noted that strict correction for multiple testing was made, which is in contrast to earlier studies of genetic variation. In conclusion, our study indicates that the major allele of rs7136446 is associated with favorable functional outcome 24-months post-stroke and with s-IGF1 in healthy controls but not in patients. The results point toward a role for IGF1 in post-stroke outcome but not for stroke risk, but this needs validation in independent samples.
