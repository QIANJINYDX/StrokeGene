# Abstract  

Constriction and dilation of large arteries of brain regulates cerebral vascular resistance and cerebral micro vascular pressure, which play key roles in regulation of cerebral circulation. We investigated the effect of ischemic stroke on vascular reactivity of middle cerebral artery (MCA) using a rat transient focal cerebral ischemia model. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 1 hour MCA occlusion followed by reperfusion. MCAs were dissected from ischemic or contra lateral hemisphere at 2 days or 2 weeks post reperfusion and mounted on 2 glass micro pipettes for assessment of vascular reactivity. MCAs from brains of sham surgeries were used as control. At 2 days post reperfusion, a significant alteration of myogenic reactivity was found in MCAs dissected from both ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres, which could still be identified at 2 weeks after reperfusion. Phenylephrine (PE) induced remarkable va so constriction in MCAs from animals that underwent sham surgery. No significant alteration of va so constrictive response to PE was found in MCAs isolated from either ischemic or contra lateral hemisphere at 2 days or 2 weeks after ischemic stroke, as compared with MCAs from sham animals. Acetylcholine (ACh) induced mild dilation in normal MCAs, which was reversed in MCAs from both ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres at 2 weeks after ischemic stroke. Sodium nitro prussi de (SNP) induced va so dilation in MCAs from animals with sham operation, which was diminished in MCAs from both ischemic and non-ischemic hemisphere at 2 days and 2 weeks after ischemic stroke. These results demonstrated that focal cerebral ischemia could induce long-term global cerebral vas cula ture dysfunction.

# INTRODUCTION  

Ischemic stroke, comprising over  $80\%$   of total stroke cases, is caused by an embolus or in situ thrombus in a cerebral artery which induces ischemic cascades that ultimately leads to irreversible brain tissue damage [1, 2]. The effort to develop effective therapies for ischemic stroke has achieved several important successes related thr ombo ly tic therapy [3]. In addition, great effort has been invested to decipher the cellular mechanisms induced by ischemic stroke and to further the quest for neuro protective therapy [2]. Surprisingly, relatively few studies have addressed mechanisms of vascular protection in terms of ischemic stroke [4, 5].  

As a cerebral vascular event, ischemic stroke induces not only a complex array of pathogenic cellular cascades in brain parenchyma, but also impairment of auto regulation in brain vas cula ture. Previous studies have demonstrated that transient focal cerebral ischemia affects myogenic response of cerebro vas cula ture at acute stage after ischemic stroke [6–8]. The myogenic response, of healthy cerebral arteries, is characterized by the constriction of these arteries to pressure and contributes significantly to auto regulation in cerebral circulation. Thus, impairment of myogenic response of cerebral vas cula ture could have a significant effect on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain function. In the present study, we investigated the long-term effect of ischemic stroke on myogenic tone of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and its reactivity in response to vasoactive agents using a transient MCA occlusion model in rats. Our study demonstrated that focal cerebral ischemia could induce long-term cerebral vas cula ture dysfunction in both ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Animals  

Male Sprague Dawley rats (body weight: 225 to  $250\mathrm{g.}$  ) were housed in a facility under 12:12 hour light/dark conditions and maintained on a standard diet and water ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out under the guidelines of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.  

# Experimental focal cerebral ischemia and isolated artery preparation  

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as described previously [9]. Animals were anesthetized by intra peritoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine   $(60\:\mathrm{mg/kg})$   and xylazine   $(10\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$  . Rectal temperature was maintained at  $37.0\pm$   $0.5~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   during stroke procedure. For MCAO, the left MCA was occluded by a 3–0 mono filament suture introduced via the internal carotid artery. After 1 hour, the suture was withdrawn for reperfusion. For sham control, sham surgeries were performed without insertion of the suture.  

At 2 days or 2 weeks after stroke, rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine   $(90\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$  and   $10\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$  , i.p.). They were then bled out by closed chest cardiac puncture, decapitated, and their brain removed and placed in Krebs buffer at   $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  . The MCAs from both ischemic and contra lateral hemispheres were removed with the aid of a dissecting microscope. The proximal end of MCA closest to the bifurcation was manipulated onto a glass micro pipette and securely tied with 11–0 surgical nylon suture. The working physiology saline solutioncerebral artery (WPSS-CA) was allowed to flow into the vessel in the original direction of flow. The vessel was pressurized to  $60\:\mathrm{mmHg}$  , lengthened to a length approximate to its in situ length, and checked for leaks. All side vessels were secured with suture and complete closure was confirmed by the stable maintenance of pressure. The vessel baths holding the cannulated MCAs were placed on inverted microscopes equipped with imaging system and micro caliper measuring device. A branch-free section of each vessel was chosen for the measurement site. Isolated arteries were allowed to warm-up to   $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and e qui lib rate at 60  $\mathrm{mmHg}$   intra lumina l pressure for 45–60 minutes, with the bathing media changed every 15 minutes. Following warm-up period, vessels were subjected to WPSS-80K for 1–2 minutes and their contract ili ty noted. Vessels that did not contract were considered non-viable and were not used. WPSS-80K was washed out and replaced with WPSS-CA and the vessels were allowed to e qui lib rate before beginning the vessel reactivity analysis in response to va so constrictor and vas odi la tors. Luminal diameter, wall thickness, and pressure were monitored continuously throughout the experiment [10, 11].  

# MCA Reactivity Analysis  

Vessels were exposed to va so constrictor phenyl ep her in e (PE) (  $\phantom{0}{.}10^{-9}$   to   $10^{-4}\,\bf{M})$  ), endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine (ACh) (  $10^{-9}$   to   $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M})$  , as well as endothelium-independent dilator sodium nitro prussi de (SNP) (  $10^{-9}$   to   $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M})$  ). Each drug was administered in whole log doses to determine the dose-response relationship for each vessel to the various vasoactive chemicals. Between dose-response curves vessels were washed 3 times at 15 minute intervals with WPSS-CA. After the last wash, vessels were allowed to e qui lib rate for at least 5 minutes before exposure to the next drug. Before exposure to ACh and SNP vessels that did not spontaneously attain  $70\%$   tone were preconstricted using PE. After completion of the dose-response curves the bathing media was removed and replaced with calcium-free media containing caffeine   $[1.94\:\mathrm{mg/m}]$  ) and th ap sig arg in (TG,  $1\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$  ). Vessels were allowed to bathe in this media for 1 hour in order to remove all stored calcium and properly assess their maximum calcium-free diameter. Calcium-free diameter reflects the maximum possible diameter for a given pressure and is limited only by vessel structure.

# Data Calculations and Statistical Analysis  

Spontaneous myogenic tone was calculated as percent increase of wall thickness or change of lumen diameter from the fully relaxed vessels at baseline by the equation: [(wall thickness at baseline– wall thickness in WPSS) / wall thickness at baseline]  $\times\mathit{100}$  or [(lumen diameter in baseline-lumen diameter in WPSS)/lumen diameter at baseline]  $\times\mathit{l o o.}$  Vessel dilation was calculated as percent possible dilation by the equation: [(lumen diameter after response - pre constricted lumen diameter)/(lumen diameter at calcium free - pre constricted lumen diameter)  $\downharpoonright]\times100,$   where the pre constricted lumen diameter was the lumen diameter before the application of the drug for that curve. Values are presented as mean  $\pm\:S.\mathrm{E.M}$  . Differences between groups were determined by ANOVA and considered significant at  $\mathsf{p}\!\!<\!\!0.05$  .  

# RESULTS  

# Transient focal cerebral ischemia induces long-term changes in myogenic reactivity of MCAs in both ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres  

In the first experiments, we investigated the effect of transient focal cerebral ischemia on myogenic tone of MCAs. Prior to the addition of WPSS-80K, lumen diameter and outside diameter of each vessel were measured. The lumen diameters of MCAs from sham controls

  $\mathrm{(n{=}5)}$  ) were significantly smaller than that of ischemic and contra lateral MCAs at 2 days

  $\mathrm{{(n{=}6})}$  ) (Figure 1) as well as 2 weeks post-reperfusion   $\mathrm{{(n{=}7)}}$  ). Conversely, the wall thicknesses of MCAs from sham animals were much larger than that of MCAs from ischemic and contra lateral hemisphere at either 2 days or 2 weeks post reperfusion. Myogenic tone was calculated in terms of both wall thickness change, as well as lumen diameter change. A significant lack of spontaneous myogenic tone was observed in MCAs from both ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres at 2 days and 2 weeks following ischemic stroke (Figure 2A & B). On the other hand, only a mild impairment of myogenic tone of MCAs from ischemic hemisphere was found at 2 days after ischemic stroke when  $80\,\mathrm{mM}$   KCl contraction solution was applied (Figure 2C & D).  

# Transient focal cerebral ischemia induces long-term changes in reactivity to vasoactive agents in MCAs of both ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres  

When the vessels were exposed to increasing doses of va so constrictor PE, a dose-dependent va so constriction was observed in MCAs derived from sham stroke and stroke animals at 2 days or 2 weeks after stroke. No significant difference was found between MCAs from sham controls and MCAs from either ischemic or the contra lateral hemisphere of stroke animals at 2 days or 2 weeks post-reperfusion (Figure 3A and B).  

A mild dilation was induced by ACh in MCAs from sham stroke and stroke animals at 2 days after stroke (Figure 4A). On the other hand, the dilatory response to ACh was replaced by a mild dose-dependent constriction in MCAs from both ischemic and contra lateral hemispheres of stroke rats at 2 weeks after reperfusion (Figure 4B). At 2 weeks after ischemia/reperfusion injury, the possible dilation induced by the highest dose of ACh (  $10^{-4}$  M) was   $12.89\pm13.96\%$   in MCAs from sham,  $-10.69\pm10.34\%$   and  $-18.26\pm11.29\%$   in MCAs from ischemic and non-ischemic hemisphere, respectively (Figure 4C).  

We further determined the effect of ischemic stroke on SNP-induced cerebro vascular dilation. SNP induced a robust va so dilation in MCAs from sham controls, which was markedly diminished in MCAs from both ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres of stroke animals at both 2 days and 2 weeks post-reperfusion (Figure 5A and B).  

# DISCUSSION  

Our current study has identified two important findings. First, ischemic stroke induces longterm changes in myogenic tone of MCAs at both ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres. Second, ischemic stroke induces long-term changes in reactivity to vasoactive agents in MCAs at both ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres. These findings may provide insight for the development of novel therapies stroke treatment.  

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that transient focal cerebral ischemia affects myogenic tone not only in local cerebro vas cula ture but also contra lateral vas cula ture at acute stage after ischemic stroke [6–8]. In the present study, we determined myogenic response of MCAs at 2 days or 2 weeks after experimental ischemic stroke as magnetic resonance imaging study has indicated that post ischemic hyper perfusion peaked at 2 days and resolved 1 week after ischemic stroke using a similar model [12]. Our result concurs  

with the previous publications, demonstrating a bilateral vas cula ture dysfunction after transient focal cerebral ischemia [6–8, 13, 14]. In addition, our study identified a long-term impairment of myogenic response in MCAs after focal cerebral ischemia.  

Focal cerebral ischemia induced not only impairment of myogenic response but also a change in reactivity to vasoactive agents in MCAs. Constriction and dilation of large arteries in the brain regulates cerebral vascular resistance and cerebral micro vascular pressure [15]. Diminished cerebral arterial responsiveness to va so constrictor 5-HT, abolition of endothelium-dependent relaxation, and diminished d is ten sibi lit y of cerebral vas cula ture s have been observed after transient focal cerebral ischemia in experimental stroke models [6, 14]. In the present study, MCAs from both ischemic and contra lateral hemispheres of stroke animals had similar dilation responses to ACh as MCAs from sham controls at 2 days postreperfusion. However, at 2 weeks post-reperfusion, both ischemic and contra lateral MCAs from stroke animals showed a lesser dilatory response than MCAs from sham controls. Interestingly, the dilative action of SNP, an endothelium-independent va so dil at or induces a robust dilation in normal MCAs, was significantly diminished in MCAs after transient focal cerebral ischemia, suggesting that an endothelium-independent mechanism could also contribute to the ischemic stroke-induced vas cula ture dysfunction. Consistently, studies have shown that loss of myogenic activity after ischemic stroke was associated with a decrease in filamentous actin in vascular smooth muscle [14, 16]. In ischemic stroke patients, SNP treatment has been found to improve local CBF given at a dose which reduced mean arterial blood pressure by   $10\:\mathrm{mmHg}$   [17]. In the present ex vivo analysis, we have identified a markedly diminish ment of va so dil at ive action of SNP in MCAs after ischemic stroke. Further in vivo studies are needed to validate our finding and its significance in term of ischemic stroke.  

Maintenance of constant CBF as a result of auto regulation caused by a combination of myogenic, neuronal, and metabolic mechanisms is critical for brain function [15, 18]. Thus, it might not be surprising that pathological conditions such as ischemic stroke could disrupt neuro vascular coupling and consequently induce cerebral vas cula ture dysfunction in the ischemic hemisphere. Increasing evidence has indicated occlusion of a cerebral artery could induce both he mo dynamic and cellular change beyond the ischemic territory [19]. During focal cerebral artery occlusion, the circulatory system can compensate for the reduction of focal CBF using collateral circulation and auto regulatory mechanisms, which causes he mo dynamic perturbations and a redistribution of CBF [20] [21]. Flow territory maps in patients of internal carotid artery occlusion showed significant differences in flow territories of contra lateral internal carotid artery and vert ebro basil ar arteries compared with those in control subjects [22]. In experimental stroke models, transient unilateral he mo dynamic stress has found to induce a transient increase in CBF velocities in the opposite hemisphere and delayed cleavage of neuronal caspase 3 in both ischemic and contra lateral side cortices, although their cause-effect relationship at the non-ischemic side remained unknown. [23]. In addition, endo the li al dysfunction has been found in the peripheral mesenteric resistance artery after experimental ischemic stroke in rats [24]. It is till unclear how focal cerebral ischemic damage induces a global vas cula ture dysfunction. A recent study has indicated that ischemic stroke could trigger an inflammatory process and an increase of cytokine expression in plasma, which might contribute to the impairment of vas cula ture function [8].  

The acute damage of myogenic reactivity and auto regulatory capacity of cerebral vas cula ture after ischemic stroke might contribute to reperfusion injury and edema formation at the ischemic territory [5, 25]. On the other hand, the long-term impairment of auto regulation of global cerebral vas cula ture might not only make the patients prone to recurrence of ischemic stroke but also contribute to the progression of vascular dementia after ischemic stroke. Stroke is the first leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. Epidemiological studies have shown that the prevalence of dementia in ischemic stroke patients is 4 to 12 times higher than controls [26]. In addition, a progressive course of cognitive function decline has been suggested [27–30]. Brain function is tightly coupled with CBF auto regulation and thus cognitive function is by default coupled to the functional capacity of brain's auto regulatory capabilities. Cognitive and sensor i motor stimulation induces increases in CBF that are associated with increased metabolic demand [31]. Ischemic stroke-induced long-term vascular dysfunction might compromise the coupling between the metabolic requirements of brain and CBF, thereby affecting cognitive function. Indeed, evidence shows that drugs used for the treatment of systemic vascular disorders such as hypertension have effects on cerebral vas cula ture function and modify the progression of dementia [32].  

In summary, the present study demonstrates that transient focal cerebral ischemia could induce long-term impairment of spontaneous myogenic tone in MCAs at both ischemic and non-ischemic areas. The loss of dilatory responses of MCAs to ACh and SNP suggest that both endo the li al-dependent and -independent mechanisms could contribute to the global vascular dysfunction induced by ischemic stroke. Our study places further emphasis on studies of vascular protection for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Chronic vascular protection through enhancement of endo the li al function and suppression of thrombosis has been a traditional approach for primary and secondary prevention of stroke [5]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the long-term effect of ischemic stroke  

on cerebral vas cula ture could eventually lead to development of more effective therapeutics for both acute treatment of ischemic stroke and prevention of vascular dementia after stroke.

Dose-response curve of MCAs from sham or stroke animals to phenylephrine (PE) at 2 days ( A , sham:  $\mathord{\mathrm{n}}\!\!=\!\!5$  ; ischemic MCA:  $\mathord{\mathrm{n}}\!\!=\!\!6$  ; non-ischemic MCA:  $\mathtt{n=6}$  ) and 2 weeks ( B , sham:  $\mathord{\mathrm{n}}\!\!=\!\!5$  ; ischemic MCA:  $\mathord{\mathsf{n}}\!\!=\!\!7$  ; non-ischemic MCA:  $\mathtt{n}{=}7$  ) after transient MCAO. PE induced a similar dose-dependent va so constriction in MCAs from sham animals (Sham MCA), ischemic (Ischemic side MCA), or contra lateral hemisphere (Contra lateral MCA).

# Figure 4.  

Dose-response curve of MCAs from sham animals, ischemic side, and contra lateral side to acetylcholine (ACh) at 2 days (A, sham:  $\mathtt{n{=}}5$  ; ischemic MCA:  $\mathord{\mathrm{n}}\!\!=\!\!6$  ; non-ischemic MCA:  $\mathtt{n=6}$  ) and 2 weeks (B & C, sham:  $\mathord{\mathrm{n}}\!\!=\!\!5$  ; ischemic MCA:   $\mathord{\mathsf{n}}\!\!=\!\!7$  ; non-ischemic MCA:  $\mathtt{n=7}$  ) after transient MCAO. Instead of dilation, ACh induced a mild dose-dependent constriction in the MCAs from both the ischemic and contra lateral hemispheres at 2 weeks after stroke (B). At 2 weeks after ischemic stroke, the highest dose of ACh   $(10^{-14}\,\bf{M})$   induced   $12.89\pm13.96\%$  dilation in MCAs from sham controls (sham MCA),  $-10.69\pm10.34\%$   and  $-18.26\pm11.29\%$  constriction in the MCAs from the ischemic (ischemic side MCA) and non-ischemic hemispheres (contra lateral MCA), respectively.

# Figure 5.  

Dose-response curve of MCAs from sham animals, ischemic side, and contra lateral side to sodium nitro prussi de (SNP) at 2 days (sham:  $\mathord{\mathrm{n}}\!\!=\!\!5$  ; ischemic MCA:  $\mathord{\mathsf{n}}\!\!=\!\!6$  ; non-ischemic MCA:  $\mathtt{n=6}$  ) and 2 weeks (sham:  $\mathord{\mathrm{n}}\!\!=\!\!5$  ; ischemic MCA:  $\mathtt{n}{=}7$  ; non-ischemic MCA:  $\mathord{\mathsf{n}}\!\!=\!\!7$  ) after transient MCAO. SNP induced a robust va so dilation in MCAs from the sham controls (Sham MCA), which was almost non-existent in MCAs from ischemic (Ischemic side MCA) and non-ischemic (Contra lateral side MCA) hemisphere at 2-days (A) and 2-weeks (B) after ischemic stroke.   $^{*}\mathrm{~p{<}0.05~}$   vs Sham MCA.
