# a b s t r a c t  

Mutations in the gene encoding ph os ph odi est erase 4D (PDE4D) enzyme are associated with ischemic stroke; however the functional implications of such mutations are not well understood. PDE4D is part of a complex protein family modulating intracellular signalling by cyclic nucleotides. The PDE4 family includes subtypes A – D, all of which show unique intracellular, cellular and tissue distribution. PDE4D is the major subtype expressed in human atrial myocytes and involved in the path o physiology of arrhythmia s, such as atrial  ﬁ brillation. The PDE4D enzyme hydrolyses cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Though diverging results are reported, several population based studies describe association of various PDE4D single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with cardio-embolic stroke in particular. Functionally, a down regulation of PDE4D variants has been reported in stroke patients.  

The anti-in ﬂ ammatory and va so dil at or properties of PDE4 inhibitors make them suitable for treatment of stroke and cardiovascular disease. PDE4D has recently been suggested as factor in atrial  ﬁ brillation. This review summarizes the possible function of PDE4D in the brain, heart, and vas cula ture. Further, association of the described SNPs, in particular, with card i oem boli c stroke, is reviewed. Current  ﬁ ndings on the PDE4D mutations suggest functionality involves an increased cardiac risk factor as well as augmented risk of atrial  ﬁ brillation.

# 1. Introduction  

Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Prevalence is high in high-income countries with incidence increasing in low- to middle-income countries resulting in large socio-economic consequences to both demographics  [1 – 3] . In general, stroke is considered to be a multi-factorial and heterogeneous disorder. Ischemic stroke is categorized as cardio-embolic (CE), large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), small-vessel lacunar (LAC) stroke, or stroke of other determined (SOD) or undetermined (UN) aetiology  [4] . The latter may in part contribute to cardio-embolic stroke  [5] .  

Both genetic and life-style related factors may increase risk of stroke; genetic factors involving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can indicate a predisposition to certain subtypes of stroke  [6,7] . Several mutations in micro satellite markers and SNPs of the STRK1 locus, chromosome 5q12, encoding ph os ph odi est erase (PDE) type 4D (PDE4D), were identi ﬁ ed as independent risk factors for ischemic stroke, in particular, large artery (carotid) and car dio geni c stroke subtypes  [7] . However, the physiological consequences and importance of the PDE4D mutation in stroke path o physiology remains an open question. Several reviews have debated the inconsistency of the genetic  ﬁ ndings  [8] . Referencing both basic and in vivo experiments, this review explores the possible path o physiological involvement of PDE4D in atherosclerosis and atrial ﬁ brillation relating to the reported association of PDE4D with large artery and car dio geni c stroke, as well as the potential use of PDE4 modulators in stroke treatment.  

# 2. The PDE superfamily  

# 2.1. Structure of PDE  

PDEs are intracellular enzymes which degrade the cyclic nucleotides adenosine and/or guanosine monophosphate (cAMP and/or cGMP) thereby modulating cellular signalling via the cAMP/cGMP pathways ( Fig. 1 ). 21 genes encoding PDEs, distributed into 11 different PDE families, have been described  [9] . All PDE genes have a high degree of conservation. The PDE enzymes exhibit highly conserved catalytic domains localized proximal to the C-terminal of the PDE gene; whereas different regulatory domains and motifs are located to the N-terminal part. Another common feature of the PDEs is a complex gene structure which generates multiple splice variants through multiple promotors; alternative start sites, and splicing. Approximately 100 different isoforms may exist in mammals, though far less are currently known  [9] . PDEs are p harm a co logical targets of interest due to their unique tissue, cellular, and intracellular local is ation  [10] . The PDE4D gene is located at chromosome 5q12  [11] . The locus is at least   $150\,\mathrm{kb}$   wide, composed of at least 22 or more exons, some of which overlap with adjacent gene PART1 [7,12]  (OMIM; 600129). Eleven different splice variants or isoforms of PDE4D are recognized (PDE4D1-11), though PDE4D10-PDE4D11 are only recognized as mice isoforms  [11,13 – 15] .  

Such include long isoforms (PDE4D3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11), short isoforms (PDE4D1, 2), and super-short isoform (PDE4D6, 10)  [11,14,15]  ( Fig. 2 ). The enzyme activity of the PDE4D isoforms depends on the presence of the N-terminal related upstream conserved regions 1 and 2 (UCR-1 and UCR-2), which modulate the PDE4D enzyme activity  [13] . N-terminals are unique to the speci ﬁ c splice variant and denote differences in protein-protein interactions or membrane associations. N-terminals locate the splice variants to speci ﬁ c cellular or sub-cellular compartments to exert their functions.  

# 2.2. PDE4 function and expression  

All members of the PDE4 family selectively degrade cAMP. Four  $-\mathtt{B},$   $-\mathsf C$   and  – D. More than 20 different PDE4 subtypes are generated under the control of variantspeci ﬁ c promotors and  ﬁ rst exons, and less so by co-transcriptional

Fig. 1.  Cellular signalling pathways associated with PDEs. Within the brain, both cAMP and cGMP degrading PDEs co-exist in cells though the cellular distribution of the PDE subtypes varies. The illustration re ﬂ ects the interplay of PDEs in cell signalling where cAMP and cGMP signalling may run in parallel. In most cells, the PDE families display a closely connected regulation of cyclic nucleotide signalling, i.e. cGMP inhibits PDE3-associated but activates PDE2-associated cAMP degradation. The regulatory GAF domains are found in both cAMP and cGMP degrading PDEs. AKAP: A-kinase anchoring protein, PKA: protein kinase A, PKG: protein kinase G, EPAC: exchange protein activated by cAMP, GAF domain: cGMPactivated PDE, adenylyl cyclase- and Fh1A-binding domain, CNGC: cyclic nucleotide gated channel, CPCR: G-protein-coupled receptors.  

modi ﬁ cation of precursor mRNA  [16,17] . PDE4 subtypes are selectively expressed in various tissues. They are expressed in speci ﬁ c areas of the brain, in organs such as the spleen, lung, heart, liver, kidney, testis, and in vascular tissue in general  [13,18,19] . In the brain, PDE4D is expressed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex  [20] , and thalamus  [21] which may be associated with memory and depression  [22] . PDE4D is also found in the area postrema, nucleus tractus solitarius, and locus coeruleus all of which associate with the emetic effects induced by PDE4 inhibition  [23] .  

# 2.3. PDE4 in disease path o physiology  

PDE4 is associated with both normal physiological functions, and disorders pertaining to cAMP signalling where PDE4 modulate cAMP response to stimuli. The role of the PDE4 enzyme family relates to speci ﬁ c isoforms, though all are speci ﬁ c with regard to cAMP hydrolysis. PDE4A is linked to depression, PDE4B to schizophrenia  [24] , PDE4D to ischemic stroke, and in particular, carotid and car dio geni c stroke  [7] . As the role of PDE4D in humans is not fully understood, assumptions of various PDE4D functions are mainly derived from animal studies.  

In the regulation of artery diameter, PDE4 contributes to the cAMP homeostasis in endo the li al and smooth muscle cells though the PDE4 isoform remains elusive. Inhibition of PDE4 causes dilatation of cerebral arteries  [25,26] . More speci ﬁ cally, PDE4 is detected in both vascular smooth muscle (human, bovine, and rat aorta)  [27]  and in endo the li al cells  [28] . Further, PDE4 inhibition causes endo the li al-dependent vasodilatation  [29] . In ischemic stroke, inhibition of PDE4 promotes protection of blood brain barrier  [30]  and reduces both in ﬂ ammation and thrombosis  [31]  (see  Fig. 3 ). In ﬂ ammation, endo the li al cell integrity, and smooth muscle cell function are signi ﬁ cant in the development of atherosclerosis  [32]  as well as in car dio geni c and carotid stroke  [33, 34] . The interplay between PDE3 and PDE4 is a key element in the

Fig. 2.  The PDE4D gene: A. The PDE4D gene display exons as cylinders. Exons 2 – 15 are included in long isoform PDE4Ds, whereas exons 6 – 15 are included in the short isoform PDE4D1, and exons 7 – 15 in PDE4D2. The single exons encoding the speci ﬁ c N-terminal region for each splice variant are numbered accordingly (modi ﬁ ed from Houslay  [102] ). The red areas represent the areas with most abundant SNP and micro satellite location  [7] . B. The composition of the long isoform PDE4Ds contains both UCR domains i.e. PDE4D3-D5, PDE4D7-D9 and PDE11  [14] . C. The composition of the short isoform PDE4Ds lack UCR1 but contain full length UCR2 domain i.e. PDE4D1 and 4D2  [17] . Of note, the number of exons varies between these subtypes. D. The composition of PDE4D super-short isoforms contains a truncated UCR2 domain. The N-terminal varies between PDE4D subtypes. UCR: Upstream conserved region.  

phenotypic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells from a contractile and quiescent to a synthetic and activated form, such being of importance in development of atherosclerosis  [11] . Long term increase in cAMP levels causes increased expression of speci ﬁ c PDE4D forms through cAMP-dependent transcription factors in human endo the li al cells  [35] ; in particularly, at the histone level of PDE4D promoter sequences in the activated smooth muscle cells. Such raises the question of a possible connection to atherosclerosis  [11,36] . The activated

Fig. 3.  PDE4 involvement in various organs and symptoms. PDE4 hydrolyses cAMP, and, by that, inactivate or modulate the intracellular cAMP signalling. Displaying unique differential actions, depending on the speci ﬁ c cellular local is ation and tissues involved, PDE4 has widespread involvement in various organs as shown above. PDE4D knockout mice display reduced airway hyper-reactivity to allergens and recruitment of neutrophils, increased myocyte contraction in response to  β 2 ad reno ce pt or stimulation, decreased tracheal contract ili ty, emesis, increased long-term memory, and antidepressant behaviour  [57] . A speci ﬁ c PDE4D modulator, which mainly alters the in ﬂ ammatory responses, may as a consequence affect COPD, asthma, cardiac function, endo the li al response, and risk of stroke. Due to the diversity of PDE4 function in the brain, there is a risk of pan-PDE4 modulators inducing potentially inappropriate and harmful side effects.  

synthetic smooth muscle cells in the intimal layer of the vessel wall contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. However, the implications of such increased PDE4D expression requires further investigation.  

In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for which PDE4 inhibitors are currently used  [37,38] , PDE4B and PDE4D modulate the cAMP signalling in in ﬂ ammation. PDE4 inhibitors reduce expression of in ﬂ ammatory cytokines and migration of in ﬂ ammatory cells  [37,39] . In ﬂ ammatory processes appear to play a signi ﬁ cant role in both development and persistence of atrial  ﬁ brillation, increasing the vulnerability of cardiac tissue thereto  [40,41] .  

Of note in brain disease and stroke, inhibitors of PDE4D improve memory by increasing cAMP, mediating phosphor yl ation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)  [42]  and facilitating hippocampal long term potenti ation (LPT), in addition to hippo camp al neuro genesis  [43] . In mice, reduced expression of PDE4D, the long form in particular, enhanced memory function  [42] . However, longterm treatment   $(24\mathrm{~h})$   with PDE4 inhibitors, and the following increased expression of PDE4D in the hippo camp al formation, impaired memory function due to the long-time reduction of cAMP levels in hippocampus and striatum  [44] .  

The role of PDE4s in brain functions in general is of interest; in particular, consideration of potential side effects, if applying PDE4 modulators to patients with disease of the brain. Further, stroke is often followed by depression  [45]  which may suggest common affected pathways. PDE4 inhibitors have been suggested for treatment of depression; however, due to side effects, further human studies have not been performed. It has been shown that anti-depressant therapy augments PDE4D expression  [22,44] ; PDE4D knock-out mice exhibit an antidepressant behaviour  [46] . Such studies suggest PDE4D may be an essential mediator of anti-depressant effects, but also that long-term treatment may impair memory  [44] . Furthermore, PDE4B regulation of cAMP signalling is associated with the dopamine signalling involved in sleep regulation  [47]  and schizophrenia  [48] , though other PDE4 subtypes or isoforms may be of signi ﬁ cance in the brain. Depression and fatigue are common post-stroke symptoms; though the path o physiology is not known  [45] , alterations in PDE4D function could be associated with such changes.  

The PDE4D splice variants associate to various cellular functions, most of which have been studied in cell cultures focussing on the cardio vascular or respiratory functions. PDE4D3 interacts with the intracellular anchoring proteins targeting cAMP signalling, the myomegalin [49] , the muscle protein kinase A anchoring protein (mAKAP), and AKAP450 . PDE4D5 sequesters the scaffolding protein    $\upbeta$  -arrestin, which associates with the  $\upbeta_{2}$  -adrenergic receptor upon agonist stimulation of the receptor, all of which play a role in downstream    $\upbeta_{2^{-}}$  adrenergic receptor signalling  [51 – 53] . Further, PDE4D5 interacts with the repeat protein receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK1)  [54] .  

A PDE4D knockout mouse has been developed; however, more than  $40\%$   of the PDE4D  $-/-$  mice die within 4 weeks of birth . The survivors show impaired neonatal growth and fertility  [55] , reduced in ﬂ ammatory responses, and increased myocyte contraction rate mediated by  $\upbeta_{2}$  -adrenergic receptors  [56 – 58] . Of further report was increased cognition  [59]  and antidepressant behaviour in addition to both impaired fear memory  [60]  and enhanced memory  [42] . Recent  ﬁ ndings of PDE4D gene mutations causing reduced PDE4D activity in patients suffering from a cro dys os to s is  [61,62] , may shed light on PDE4D effects in humans. These patients are characterized by midface and nasal hypoplasia, reduced growth, moderate intellectual disability, progressive obesity, and in two cases heart defects  [63] . There are yet no reports on stroke in this young group of patients. Though reduced PDE4D activity was predicted, compensatory up-regulation of other PDE4 subtypes modulates the outcome  [64] , paradoxically causing decreased cAMP responses which could account for some of the de ﬁ cits  [61] . This calls for further investigations in this unique group of patients.  

Based on the above  ﬁ ndings, PDE4D plays a signi ﬁ cant role in basic cellular functions, though there is a  ﬁ ne balance between positive and negative effects. Further studies in human tissue and/or humans are necessary in order to fully understand the functions of PDE4D and splice variants, and, in addition, the possible consequences of PDE4D modulation in human path o physiology related to card i oem boli c stroke.  

# 3. PDE4D  —  a risk factor for stroke  

# 3.1. PDE4D variants and stroke risk  

Stroke, a multi-factorial disease in ﬂ uenced by age, co-morbid i ties, life-style-associated risk factors, e.g. diabetes and hypertension, also involves a genetic  ﬁ ngerprint feature in its path o physiology  [65] . Some families have increased prevalence of stroke  [66]  and twin studies show that concordance rate for stroke is higher in monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins  [67] . In just  $5\%$   of the stroke population, single-gene disorders have been associated with ischemic stroke  [68, 69] ; the remaining stroke cases develop from a multi-factorial aetiology, and a more complex genetic background. However, in the few cases of single gene disorders, genotyping for speci ﬁ c genetic defects could tailor a possible preventive treatment for susceptible individuals.  

In 2002, Greta rs do ttir et al. performed a genome-wide search and found the strk1 locus on chromosome 5q12  [70] , representing the PDE4D gene  [7] , to be associated with ischemic stroke. In the PDE4D gene, mutations of micro satellite markers and SNPs were found to associate with ischemic stroke: micro satellite marker AC008818-1 with both car dio geni c stroke and stroke related to carotid stenosis (large artery atherosclerosis (LAA)); DG5S397 and SNP83 with LAA; SNP41, SNP45, SNP56, SNP87 and SNP89 with a combination of car dio geni c stroke and LAA  [7] . All SNPs and markers were located in intron regions in the  $5^{\prime}$  -end of the PDE4D gene. In comparison of stroke patients with control individuals  [7] , analysis of PDE4D in B-cell lymphocyte cell lines revealed signi ﬁ cantly lower total mRNA expression of the PDE4D isoforms -4D1, -4D2 and -4D5. However, when de ﬁ ning three haplotypes (wild-type, at-risk and protective), the stroke patients positive for the at-risk haplotype had a signi ﬁ cantly lower expression of the PDE4D7 and PDE4D9 mRNA, but not PDE4D1, 4D2 and 4D5. PDE4D protein expression or effects on enzyme activity were not investigated. The data thus indicates both long (PDE4D5, PDE4D7, and PDE4D9) and short forms (PDE4D1/2) of PDE4D are involved in stroke risk; however, the path o physiological role of each isoform requires clari ﬁ cation. The haplotype association renders the long forms (PDE4D7 and PDE4D9) interesting targets  [7]  in cardio-embolic stroke, with PDE4D1/2 of interest in atherosclerosis and large artery stroke  [36] .  

Gronds-Ginsbach et al.  [71]  investigated the PDE4D transcripts in blood mono nuclear cells from acute ischemic stroke patients using micro-array. They reported signi ﬁ cantly lower levels of PDE4D (not speci ﬁ ed into isoforms) in stroke patients in comparison with healthy control subjects. As micro-array analysis is most suitable for screening analysis, such results must be veri ﬁ ed using real-time PCR and, in particular, also at the protein level regarding both expression and activity.  

In support of the hypothesis of PDE4D being an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, the several attempts to reproduce the original data  [7]  con ﬁ rm, in the main, the results ( Table 1 ). Data relating to association between PDE4D variants and cardio-embolic stroke contributes to the original hypothesis. The involvement of PDE4D for susceptibility to atrial  ﬁ brillation points towards increased risk for car dio geni c stroke. Some studies reproduced the original Icelandic results or found new SNPs whereas some did not ( Table 1 ). Such inconsistencies may derive from variations in the population investigated. The Icelandic population may be considered more genetically homogenous (or biased by a founder) compared to other populations studied. In the population studies showing association, mainly Caucasians were included ( Table 1 ). Further, divergent results could re ﬂ ect variations in factors such as geneenvironment interactions, the polymorphisms chosen for analysis, the case control groups chosen or the applied diagnostic criteria of stroke subgroups between studies. The majority of studies associated the

SNPs with cardio-embolic stroke and less so with large artery stroke; such may re ﬂ ect differences in diagnostic work-up, challenging correct subtyping of stroke. As a result, the importance of the SNPs to subsequent PDE4D function in stroke subjects remains obscure.  

3.2. Implication of PDE4D in brain and cerebro vascular function  

In humans, there is substantial data on the distribution of PDE4D and in the brain, though less on the distribution in the associated blood vessels. When present in neurons, PDE4D mutations could, in addition to the modulation of in ﬂ ammatory response, affect cerebral function. This may alter cerebral vulnerability to ischemic stroke or add complexity when targeting PDE4D in stroke treatment.  

Applying two-step immune-precipitation technique, PDE4D protein expression can be distinguished in homogenized mouse brain tissues

 [55] . PDE4D mRNA were widely distributed in rat tissue and cell cultures

 (brain, heart, kidney, spleen, lung, liver, testis)  [13,23] . PDE4D is expressed in rat brain micro vessels responsible for cerebral blood  ﬂ ow and blood brain barrier permeability  [72] . Further, cerebral ischemia increased expression of PDE4D and blood brain barrier permeability relative to age  [73] . One study, using the technique of in situ hybridisation with PDE4D mRNA but not protein, showed PDE4D and PDE4B to be the most abundant PDE4 isoforms in the human brain. PDE4D mRNA was high in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, areas of the thalamus, parts of the brain stem, and cerebellum  [74] . No details were provided as to distribution in the associated blood vessels. Corresponding to the mRNA  ﬁ ndings, the PDE4D protein was detected, by immuno his to chemistry, at crucial sites: the inferior ganglion of the vagal nerve which associates to several key functions e.g. cardiac rhythm. PDE4D is further found in the area postrema, in neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius, and locus coeruleus. PDE4D's presence in the area postrema and neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius is consistent with a role in the emetic response, seen also by pan-PDE4 inhibition  [23,74] .  

A recent study has described PDE4D to be the major PDE4 subtype expressed in human atrium  [75] ; such is highly relevant if PDE4 mutations induce increased risk of atrial  ﬁ brillation and subsequent stroke. Such could associate to the increased risk of cardio-embolic stroke reported in the epidemiological studies.  

In human cerebral arteries, rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) sensitive activity is found  [25]  similar to that found in canine, rat, and guinea pig cerebral arteries  [25,26,76] . Inhibitors of PDE4 indicate endo the li al dependent vasodilatation increasing cAMP levels  [25] . Such dependen- cy on an intact endo the li al nitric-oxide signalling for PDE4 inhibitors to act as vas odi la tors was observed in several artery beds, including the cerebral. The cross talk between nitric-oxide and PDE4 function may be either directly, with cAMP activating protein kinase G, or indirectly, through endo the li al derived nitric oxide which stimulates cGMP synthesis in smooth muscle cells. The increase in smooth muscle cell cGMP inhibits and outplays the role of PDE3 in cAMP hydrolysis; leaving PDE4 to modulate the nitric oxide associated vascular response  [77] . However, the responses vary between species. Similar effects of PDE4 inhibitors on cAMP hydrolysis were noted  [25] . How such variations in vascular responses may relate to effects of PDE4 inhibitors on decreased endo the li al function in humans is not known.  

PDE4 inhibition in human endo the li al cells causes an increase in cAMP level associated with reduction of agonist-induced increases in  $[\mathsf{C}\mathsf{a}^{2+}]$   which might contribute to vasodilatation  [78] . In relation to athero sclerosis in humans, a dose-dependent relationship between PDE4D mutations and the degree of smoking activity was described  [79]  suggesting a connection with PDE4D to dysfunctional endothelium.  

PDE4 inhibitors have been suggested as therapeutic targets in athero sclerosis  [57]  and in treatment of vasospasm occurring post subarachnoid haemorrhage  [26] ; however, due to side effects, such have not been applied to humans for these indications. In animal studies, the selective PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (which does not distinguish between PDE4 A-D types) was used in stroke models; such resulted in minor improvement in sensori-motor function although effects were concealed by side effects  [80] . In a study investigating object memory, rolipram generally enhanced blood  ﬂ ow when measured using the auto radio graph y technique  [81] .  

Several studies have investigated the association partners and activity of PDE4D subtypes under various conditions  [13,82,83] ; however, almost all studies were performed in cells originating from outside of the brain and, often, cells expressing recombinant PDE4D isoforms. Accordingly, such data should be placed in context when considering application and clinical relevance to a human study.  

In cell cultures of rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), PDE4D1 and -4D2, but not PDE4D5 and PDE4D3, were induced in activated/proliferating VSMC associated with at hero sclerotic plaque formation  [36] . Accordingly, inhibiting the short forms of PDE4D may be worthy of investigation. In human lung micro vascular endo the li al cells, rolipram modulates induction of the endo the li al adhesion molecules E-selectin and vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM-1)  [84] . Though requiring to be tested in brain endo the li al vascular cells, such may be of interest in stroke path o physiology.  

The effects of PDE4D knockout contribute to cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmia s; in particularly individuals with underlying cardiac disease are at high risk  [85] .  

# 3.3. PDE4 and atrial  ﬁ brillation  

Atrial  ﬁ brillation is a major risk factor in ischemic stroke  [86] ; risk may be further increased by concurrent in ﬂ ammation  [87] . Reduced PDE4D activity associates with heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia s [85] , and may decrease cardiac contract ili ty  [88] . In a genome-wide association study, PDE4D was found to link to card i oem boli c stroke risk [89] . As PDE4 activity decreases with age in patients with atrial  ﬁ brillation compared with age-matched controls, such may increase risk of atrial  ﬁ brillation  [75] . This risk was associated with increased L-type  $\mathtt{C a}^{++}$    current and baseline   $\mathtt{C a}^{++}$    release. However, as PDE4D may play a part in in ﬂ ammatory responses associated with the pathophysiology of atrial  ﬁ brillation and risk of stroke, PDE4D could be considered in prevention thereof at various levels.  

# 4. PDE4 as therapeutic target  

# 4.1. PDE4 modulators  

PDE inhibitors or activators may be useful drugs through their speci ﬁ c regulation of the cyclic nucleotide levels. PDEs show a unique expression pro ﬁ le in the single tissue with each PDE performing a speci ﬁ c physiological task  [9] . Although the high degree of conservation at the catalytic site could make it dif ﬁ cult for PDE modulators to distinguish between PDE family members, subtypes and splice variants  [9] , the  ﬁ ndings of unique PDE family- or subtype-speci ﬁ c folding in substrate binding pockets help development of family speci ﬁ c inhibitors. Thus, a number of highly selective inhibitors are now available for individual PDE families, also for clinical applications  [90] . The PDE4 family is probably the most complex with its multitude of subtypes and isoforms making the production of selective drugs dif ﬁ cult, in particular when developing competitive inhibitors acting at the catalytic site. A high degree of subtype selectivity is possible using small molecules which act as allosteric inhibitors changing the conformation of the UCR domain, thus modulating the activity of the PDE4 enzyme  [91] .  

Depending on which cellular mechanisms or disease to target either an inhibitor or an activator of PDE4D would be of interest. Considering the  ﬁ ndings of a reduced PDE4D expression or activity in stroke and cardiac arrhythmia, the focus on activators appear particularly interesting in cardio-embolic stroke, though the cognitive de ﬁ cits suggested with increased PDE4 activity are worrisome. With the increasing attention on PDE4 inhibitors as cognitive enhancers, thus requiring brain penetrance of the PDE4 inhibitors, future studies including both activation and inhibition are essential to understand functions, compensatory mechanisms, and disclose unwanted side effects of the PDE4D modulators.  

Ro ﬂ umilast is a currently used PDE4 inhibitor with some PDE4D selectivity, though not optimal  [92] . As PDE4 is widely distributed in the central nervous system and the cerebral vas cula ture  [18,23,25] , modulators of PDE4 activity could be used as therapeutic agents in cerebro vascular diseases. Somehow challenging to develop and due to lack of clearly established indications, activators of PDEs are not yet available. In a yeast high-throughput model PDE activators were detected; however, the mechanisms of activation are not known  [93] . Enzymes such as PDE5 can become constitutive ly active by serine mutations inducing conformation al changes of the enzyme  [94] ; similar principles of regulating enzyme activity may apply to PDE4 where an open conformation al state of UCR2 is a key element in PDE4D activation [91] . Although several selective PDE4 inhibitors have been developed, few have reached phase 3 trials. The PDE4 inhibitors Cilomilast (Gla xo Smith Kline)  [95]  and Ro ﬂ umilast (Daxas;Nycomed)  [37]  were tested in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), resulting in anti-in ﬂ ammatory and broncho dil at or effects, Apremilast is currently tested as an anti-in ﬂ ammatory in treatment of psoriasis  [96] ; with further research required into cerebro vascular effects. Ro ﬂ umilast has been released for clinical use in severe COPD  [97] . However, of great concern are the unpleasant side effects attending PDE4 inhibitors in general, especially dose-limiting side effects such as nausea  [57,98,99] . Emetic effects are suggested to be caused by inhibition of the PDE4D isotype localized in area postrema and nucleus of the tractus solitarius [23,99] , though it could also be caused by a general inhibition of PDE4A-D activity. Both anatomical areas are known to be involved in emetic processing. Use of selective PDE4D allosteric inhibitors causing submaximal PDE4D inhibition in vitro, does however not implicate nausea as side effects in animal studies  [91] , suggesting splice variant speci ﬁ c mechanisms or a cAMP level threshold for induction of nausea. As to the path o physiology of stroke and atherosclerosis, side effects for concern are arteritis and in ﬂ ammation reported in both laboratory animals and non-human primates after application of nonselective PDE4 inhibitors  [95,100] . It is not known whether such is due to initial inhibition of all PDE4 subtypes or a secondary upregulation of PDE4D causing a phenotypic change in smooth muscle cells towards proliferation. These side effects could suggest PDE4 inhibitors enhance conditions preceding at hero sclerotic plaques, depending on which PDE4 splice variant is most affected. Of note a recent study found no sign of arteritis in rats after exposure to PDE4D selective inhibitors  [91]  thus arthritis could be related to the remaining PDE4 subtypes, but further studies are warranted to exclude such side effect.  

Though PDE4 inhibitors are developed for in ﬂ ammatory conditions, the mechanisms by which PDE4D inhibitors regulate in ﬂ ammatory, smooth muscle and endo the li al cells functions in humans is not fully explored. In the patients suffering from PDE4D mutations and a cro dys os to s is there are so far no reports on vascular changes or increased incidence of infectious or in ﬂ ammatory diseases occurring more frequently.  

A major advantage of developing speci ﬁ c PDE4D, as compared to pan-PDE4 modulators, is to  ﬁ ne tune-the complex PDE4 mediated cAMP signalling, and by that reduce side effects and unwanted compensatory mechanisms.  

Activation, and not inhibition, of the PDE4D enzyme may have a positive effect on the path o physiology relating to ischemic stroke. However, side effects of PDE4D activation may be equally challenging as reported with non-selective PDE4 inhibitors  [101]  but can so far only be assumed; e.g. memory disturbances, va so constriction, cardiac hypertrophy, and inadvertent activation of an in ﬂ ammatory response. Possible side effects of PDE4D activation are not necessarily opposite to those seen with PDE4 inhibition, other pathways could be involved or induced compensatory mechanisms affecting the cAMP pathway may in ﬂ uence the outcome; further exploration of the matter is de ﬁ nitely needed.  

Focused treatment of susceptible individuals detected by genotyping of PDE4D SNPs may provide basis for new stroke preventive treatment using either PDE4D inhibitors or activators, dependent on results from functional studies of such patients. Differentiated inhibition/activation of PDE subtypes are worthy of further research; however, due to the structure of PDE4D subtypes, such may prove dif ﬁ cult.  

# 5. Conclusion  

Current clinical studies indicate an association of PDE4D mutations and risk of cardiac embolic stroke. In concert with those  ﬁ ndings, reduced PDE4D predisposes individuals to atrial  ﬁ brillation which increases the risk of car dio geni c stroke. The presence of PDE4D in the blood vessels (smooth muscle and endo the li al cells), a possible connection to a dysfunctional endothelium, and conversion of smooth muscle cells from quiescent to synthetic state, may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and large artery stroke. The association of PDE4D to in ﬂ ammation and presence of PDE4D in atrial myocytes may associate to cardio-embolic stroke. More studies focussing on the expression levels and activity of PDE4D are necessary to fully determine the role of PDE4D in ischemic stroke. Equally necessary are investigations of functional and physiological effects of the described SNP mutations, in particular those relating to cardiac function and stroke. Development of selective PDE4D activators with a better adverse events pro ﬁ le, rather than selective PDE4D inhibitors, could be the way forward in the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, especially if a gene mutation is present.  

To con ﬁ rm the importance of PDE4D in the path o physiology and treatment of cerebro vascular disease, further investigation is necessary as to the functional role of PDE4D, the mutations and effect of selected inhibitors or activators.
