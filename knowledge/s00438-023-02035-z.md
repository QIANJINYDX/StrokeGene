# Abstract  

High-altitude adaptation (HAA) was reported to be significantly associated with reduced risks for multiple cardiovascular  diseases (CVDs). However, the causality and direction of the associations are largely un characterized. We aimed to examine  the potential causal relationships between HAA and six types of CVD, including coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebral  aneurysm, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation. We obtained the summary data  from largest available genome-wide association study of HAA and six types of CVD. Two-sample bidirectional Mendelian  random iz ation (MR) analyses were performed to infer the causality between them. In the sensitivity analyses, MR-Egger  regression analyses and MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) global analyses were used to assess the  pleiotropic effects; Cochran's Q tests were used to test the heterogeneity by inverse variance-weighted (IVW) and MR-Egger  methods; and the leave-one-out analyses were used to examine whether some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could  influence the results independently. The MR main analyses showed that the genetically instrumented HAA was significantly  causally associated with the reduced risks of CAD (odds ratio   $[\mathrm{OR}]\!=\!0.029$  ;  $95\%$   confidence interval   $[\mathrm{CI}]\!=\!0.004\!-\!0.234$  ;   $P\!=\!8.64\!\times\!10^{-4})$  ). In contrast, there was no statistically significant relationship between CVDs and HAA. Our findings provide  evidence for the causal effects of HAA on the reduced risks of CAD. However, there is no causality of CVDs on HAA. These  findings might be helpful in developing the prevention and intervention strategies for CAD.

# Introduction  

More than 140 million humans have permanently settled in  high-altitude regions around the world (Moore et al.  1998 ;  Tremblay and Ainslie  2021 ), although the hypoxic and  cold conditions of high-altitude regions present numerous  challenges to human survival (Pamenter et al.  2020 ). The  geographically distinct populations have evolved different adaptations to the high-altitude environment (Pamenter  et al.  2020 ). Among these populations, Tibetans have successfully settled in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau for thousands  of years, and are well adapted to the high-altitude environment (Qi et al.  2013 ). An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that the high-altitude adaptation 

 (HAA) of Tibetans is a result of natural positive selection 

 (Simonson et al.  2010 ; Peng et al.  2011 ). Cardiovascular  diseases (CVDs) are the most common causes of death  globally (Roth et al.  2020 ). Among various CVDs, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the foremost cause of mortality worldwide, which was estimated to affect \~ 197 million  patients globally and accounted for  $\sim\!9.1$   million deaths per  year(Wang et al.  2020 ). Therefore, there is a need for the  development of effective strategies for the treatment and  prevention of CVDs.  

HAA has been found to be associated with reduced  risks of multiple CVDs (Mortimer et al.  1977 ; Fujimoto  et al.  1989 ; Faeh et al.  2009 ). For example, epi de mio logi- cal studies have reported that the prevalence of CAD in  Tibetans was lower than that in plain-living populations  (Fujimoto et al.  1989 ). In addition, CVD patients who  exposed to high-altitude hypoxia were at an increased  risk of adverse events (Cornwell et al.  2021 ). Furthermore,  genetic studies have found that the HAA-related single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also significantly  associated with a number of cardiovascular phenotypes,  including the left atrial size, and susceptibility to atrial  fibrillation, myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease (Crawford et al.  2017 ). However, it remains unclear  whether there is a causal relationship between HAA and  the risk of CVDs.  

the genetic variants which are significantly associated with  the risk factors as instrumental variables (IVs) (Lawlor  et al.  2016 ). MR relies on the natural random classification  of genetic variations during meiosis, resulting in a grouping process similar to randomized controlled trial (RCT)  in the population (Smith and Ebrahim  2003 ). Because  external interference usually does not change the germline  DNA sequence (Nattel  2013 ), MR is not easy to reverse  causality (Lawlor et al.  2008 ). More importantly, genetic  variants are typically free from confounding factors owing  to the random independent assortment of DNA at meiotic  segregation of alleles (Holmes et al.  2017 ); thus, MR pro- vides a more reliable understanding of the potential causal  relationship between the exposures and outcomes (Zheng  et al.  2017 ). Finally, because genetic variations remain stable throughout the life, MR analyses could provide insight  from the lifetime genetic risk factors.  

In this study, we hypothesized that there might be a  directional causal effect between HAA and CVDs, and  then performed a bidirectional MR analysis between HAA  and six types of CVD using the large-scale meta-analysis  of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) (Fig.  1 ). We  identified that HAA has a causal protective effect on CAD;  however, we did not find any significant causal effects of  CVDs on HAA in the reverse MR analyses. Our findings that  HAA has a causal protective effect on CAD might be helpful  for the therapeutic strategies for CVDs.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study design overview  

We performed two-sample MR analyses to estimate the  causal effects of HAA on CVDs, and vice versa (Fig.  1 ).  The GWAS summary statistics of HAA from Tibetans and  non-Tibetans of Eastern Asian ancestry were achieved from  a previous study (Yang et al.  2017 ). The GWAS summary  statistics of the CVDs, which included CAD, cerebral aneurysm, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, arrhythmia  and atrial fibrillation, were obtained from the GWASs of  Eastern Asian-ancestry participants from the BioBank Japan  (BBJ) Project ( http://​jenger.​riken.​jp/​en/ ), which is a biobank  that collaborative ly collects DNA and serum samples from  12 medical institutions in Japan (Hirata et al.  2017 ; Low  et al.  2017 ; Nagai et al.  2017 ; Ishigaki et al.  2020 ). All these  GWAS summary statistics were calculated using the linear  (Yang et al.  2017 ) or logistic (Low et al.  2017 ; Ishigaki et al.  2020 ) regression models.  

Increasingly, Mendelian random iz ation (MR) analyses  have enabled evaluation of the causality between risk factors and disease outcomes (Lawlor et al.  2008 ) by use of

# GWAS summary statistics of HAA  

The GWAS summary statistics for HAA were achieved  from Yang et al. study (Yang et al.  2017 ). The subjects  with stronger HAA are defined as healthy individuals  living in high-altitude regions, with no known medical  record or indication of chronic mountain sickness (CMS)  or other altitude-related illness (Valverde et al.  2015 ).  This study included a total of 10,295 individuals (including 3,008 Tibetans and 7,287 non-Tibetan individuals of  

Eastern Asian ancestry), which was the largest GWAS of  HAA to date. The male/female ratio of the Tibetans is 0.59  and the mean age is not available. The male/female ratio  and the mean age of the non-Tibetan individuals of East  Asians ancestry are also not available. The basic characteristics of the GWAS for HAA were summarized in Supplementary Table 1.  

# GWAS summary statistics of CVDs  

The GWAS summary statistics for those six types of CVD  were obtained from BBJ Project (Hirata et al.  2017 ; Low  et al.  2017 ; Nagai et al.  2017 ; Ishigaki et al.  2020 ). The  definitions of the CVDs cases and controls were described  previously (Low et al.  2017 ; Ishigaki et al.  2020 ). In total,  we achieved: (i) 212,453 individuals in the GWAS of CAD  (including 29,319 cases and 183,134 controls) (Ishigaki  et al.  2020 ); (ii) 195,203 individuals in the GWAS of cer- ebral aneurysm (2,820 cases and 192,383 controls) (Ishigaki et al.  2020 ); (iii) 210,054 individuals in the GWAS of  ischemic stroke (17,671 cases and 192,383 controls) (Ishigaki et al.  2020 ); (iv) 212,453 individuals in the GWAS of  peripheral artery disease (3,593 cases and 208,860 controls)  (Ishigaki et al.  2020 ); (v) 212,453 individuals in the GWAS  of arrhythmia (17,861 cases and 194,592 controls) (Ishigaki  et al.  2020 ); and (vi) 36,792 individuals in the GWAS of  atrial fibrillation (8,180 cases and 28,612 controls) (Low  et al.  2017 ). The detailed information of these populations  and the demographic data are provided in Supplementary  Table 1.  

# Selection of IVs for HAA  

To select IVs for HAA, first we extracted SNPs that are  significantly associated with HAA (with   $P<5\times10^{-8}$  ;   $n\!=\!870$  ). Second, we removed the SNPs which show strong  linkage d is equilibrium (LD) with each other   $(r^{2}\!<\!0.001)$  ,  and retained 9 SNPs. Third, we removed the SNPs that are  palindromic or have possible strand mismatch between the  summary statistics of the exposure and those of the outcome (Hemani et al.  2017 ). No SNP was removed in this  step. Fourth, we extracted data for the above-selected 9  SNPs from the outcome traits (CVDs) GWAS summary. By  default, if a particular requested SNP was not present in the  CVDs GWAS, then another SNP (proxy) that was in LD  with the requested SNP   $(r^{2}\!>\!0.6$   in the East Asian populations from the 1,000 Genomes Project) would be used.  However, two of these SNPs (rs1801133 and rs 139129572)  and their proxy SNPs were not present in the GWASs of the  six types of CVD. Thus, these two SNPs were removed from  further analyses. Fifthly, we excluded any of the selected  SNPs that were associated with other phenotypes at risk  of affecting CVDs independently of the ability of HAA by  searching through GWAS catalog and Phe no Scanner. The  SNP rs4498258 has been reported previously to be associated with the forced expiratory volume in 1-s (FEV1)  according to Phe no Scanner V2. While FEV1 was reported  to be an independent and general iz able predictor of CVDs  (Duong et al.  2019 ). Therefore, rs4498258 was considered  as a potential confounder SNP, and was then removed from  the IVs. For the remaining 6 SNPs, MR-PRESSO did not  detect any potential outliers (all MR-PRESSO global tests  $P$    values  $>\!0.05.$  ). Finally, we selected 6 SNPs as IVs for HAA.  The detailed information of IVs was provided in Supplementary Table 2.  

# Selection of IVs for six types of CVD  

To select the IVs for six types of CVD, we extracted the  SNPs that are significantly associated with these CVDs   $(P<5\times10^{-8})$  ), and achieved 8,936, 162, 187, 32, 1,412 and  1,064 SNPs for CAD, cerebral aneurysm, ischemic stroke,  peripheral artery disease, arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation,  respectively. We then applied the same steps as described  above for HAA. Briefly, we removed the SNPs which show  strong LD with each other   $(r^{2}\!<\!0.001)$  . Then, we removed  the SNPs that are palindromic or have possible strand mismatch between the summary statistics of the exposure and  those of the outcome (Hemani et al.  2017 ). Therefore, we  obtained 72 SNPs for CAD, 5 SNPs for cerebral aneurysm,  3 SNPs for ischemic stroke, 2 SNPs for peripheral artery dis- ease, 23 SNPs for arrhythmia and 19 SNPs for atrial fibrillation as IVs, respectively. For the above-selected instrument  SNPs, if the MR-PRESSO analyses detected significant horizontal pleiotropy, we shall remove the outlier variants (with   $P$   values less than the threshold 0.05 in the MR-PRESSO  outlier test). After the MR-PRESSO outlier removal step,  if the heterogeneity was still significant, we would further  remove all the SNPs of which the   $P$   value was less than 1,  but not equal to 1 in the MR-PRESSO outlier test. Finally,  after removing 6 outliers for CAD-HAA, 4 outliers for  Arrhythmia-HAA and 4 outliers for atrial fibrillation-HAA,  we obtained 66 SNPs for CAD, 5 SNPs for cerebral aneurysm, 3 SNPs for ischemic stroke, 2 SNPs for peripheral  artery disease, 19 SNPs for arrhythmia and 15 SNPs for  atrial fibrillation as IVs, respectively. The detailed information of IVs for CVDs was provided in Supplementary  Tables 3 and 4.  

# Strength estimates of the IVs  

We used the  $F$   statistic to assess the strength of the IVs in our  MR analyses as described previously (Palmer et al.  2012 ).  The  $F$   statistic was calculated using the following equation:   $F{=}(R^{2}/k)/([1{\cdot}R^{2}]/[n{\cdot}k{\cdot}1])$  , where  $R^{2}$   is the proportion of risk  factor variability explained by genotype,  $k$   is the number  of instruments used in the model, and  $n$   is the sample size  (Palmer et al.  2012 ). It is typically recommended for MR  analyses that the  $F$   value should be larger than 10 (Palmer  et al.  2012 ), which indicates that the association between the  IVs and exposure is strong enough, and therefore the results  of the MR analyses can avoid being affected by weak instrument bias (Burgess and Thompson  2011 ).  

# MR analyses  

MR analyses were performed in R using the “TwoSampleMR” package (version 0.4.20;  https://​github.​com/​ MRCIEU/​TwoSa​mpleMR ). Five different methods, including the inverse variance weighted (IVW), simple mode,  weighted mode, weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods, were implemented in the “Two Sample MR”  R package. This package harmonizes the GWAS summary  statistics of exposure and outcome data sets containing  information such as SNP IDs, effect and reference alleles,  effect sizes (odds ratios [ORs] should be converted to  $\upbeta$   by  the transformation of log), standard errors (SEs),   $P$   values,  and frequencies of effect alleles for genetic variants. Effect  estimates are reported as ORs and  $95\%$   confidence intervals 

 (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes ( i.e. , status of CVDs). The 

 “generate odds ratios” command in the “Two Sample MR”  package was used to take the betas and SEs from the MR  analyses and generate ORs and   $95\%\mathrm{Cs}$   ( https://​mrcieu.​ github.​io/​TwoSa​mpleMR/​refer​ence/​gener​ate_​odds_​ratios.​ html)  (Tang et al.  2020 ). The IVW method was designated  as the “main analyses” in this study. We conducted the IVW  method with the fixed or random effect model, according to  the heterogeneity tests. If the  $P$   value of heterogeneity was  less than 0.05, a random-effects model of IVW was used;  otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used.  

In all two-sample MR analyses, a two-sided  $P$   value of  less than 0.01 (0.05/5 MR methods, for multiple testing) was  considered to be statistically significant.  

# Sensitivity analyses  

MR design is based on 3 assumptions: (IV1) the genetic  variants are robustly associated with the exposure; (IV2)  the genetic variants are not associated with the other confounders; and (IV3) the genetic variants are associated with  the outcome only through the investigated exposure (Emdin  et al.  2017 ). In order to critically examine the underlying  assumptions of the MR approach (IV1–IV3), several sensitivity analyses, including the horizontal pleiotropy tests, heterogeneity tests and leave-one-out analyses, were performed  to evaluate the robustness of the causal effect estimates of  HAA on CVDs, and vice versa.  

# Horizontal pleiotropy tests  

Associations violating assumptions IV2 and IV3 are generally referred to as horizontal pleiotropic associations. In  short, horizontal pleiotropy occurs when the variant has  an effect on disease independent of its effect on the exposure, horizontal pleiotropy occurs in MR. Violation of the  “no horizontal pleiotropy” assumption can cause severe  bias in MR (Verbanck et al.  2018 ). To assess the robustness of significant results, we conducted horizontal pleiotropy analyses using MR-Egger regression methods. We  further applied the MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) global tests to reduce heterogeneity in  the estimate of the causal effect to remove SNPs that were  horizontal pleiotropic outliers. We conducted this analysis  by using the MR-PRESSO R package ( https://​github.​com/​ rondo​lab/​MR-​PRESSO)  (Verbanck et al.  2018 ). The number  of distributions was set to 2000 and the threshold was set to  0.05. A   $P$   value  $>\!0.05$   represents no significant pleiotropy  of the independent HAA genetic IVs in the CVDs GWASs,  and vice versa.  

# Heterogeneity tests  

Cochran’s Q test was applied to assess the heterogeneity  between individual genetic variants estimates using the MREgger method and IVW method. If the  $P$   value from either  method is less than 0.05, the final results of MR are referred  to a random-effects model of IVW; and otherwise, a fixedeffects model of IVW is used. A   $P$   value  $>\!0.05$   represents  no significant heterogeneity.  

# Leave‑one‑out analyses  

We conducted the leave-one-out sensitivity tests to examine whether the results are caused by any single SNP. Specifically, we systematically removed each SNP in turn and  repeated the IVW analyses to assess whether a single SNP  drives the association (Gage et al.  2017 ).  

# Results  

# Characteristics of the selected IVs  

To examine the bidirectional correlations between HAA  and CVDs, we first selected the IVs for HAA and CVDs,  respectively. We used the GWAS summary statistics of  HAA and six types of CVD (including CAD, cerebral aneurysm, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, arrhythmia  and atrial fibrillation) from Yang et al. study (Yang et al.  2017 ) and BBJ Project (Low et al.  2017 ; Ishigaki et al.  2020 ), respectively (Supplementary Table 1). After SNPs  prior it iz ation (Methods), we finally achieved 6 SNPs as  IVs for HAA (Supplementary Table 2, and Supplementary  Fig. 1), and 66, 5, 3, 2, 19 and 15 SNPs as IVs for six types  of CVD, respectively (Supplementary Table 4, and Supplementary Fig. 2). The mean  $F$   statistics for these SNPs  ranged from 32 to 99 among the HAA and six types of CVD  (Supplementary Table 5), suggesting that the possibility  of weak instrument bias is small (Burgess and Thompson  2011 ).

We  used five methods, including the inverse variance weighted (IVW),  simple mode, weighted mode, weighted median and MR-Egger  regression methods, for MR analyses. IVW method with fixed-effect  model was used as the main analysis for MR analyses of all HAACVDs, except the HAA-Arrhythmia. Considering the statistically  significant heterogeneity of HAA-Arrhythmia, IVW method with random-effect model, rather than fixed-effect model, was used as main  MR analysis. The blue squares represent the estimates of the odds  ratios (ORs) for each MR method, and the bars to the left and right  of each blue square indicate the   $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs).

We conducted MR analyses using five different methods, including the IVW, simple mode,  weighted mode, weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods.

In the heterogeneity tests in this study, the Cochran's Q statistics for HAA-Arrhythmia showed significant he te rogen ei ties; thus, we  conducted IVW method with the random effect model for HAA-Arrhythmia.

# MR estimation of the causality of HAA on CVDs  

To check the causality of HAA on the risk of six types  of CVD, we conducted MR analyses using five different methods, including the IVW, simple mode, weighted  mode, weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods  (Methods). The forest plots and scatter plots of the estimation for the overall causal effect are displayed in Fig.  2   and Supplementary Fig. 3, respectively. According to the  results from the main analyses ( i.e. , the IVW method), compared to the reference group, the HAA group had   $97.1\%$    lower risk of CAD   $(\mathrm{OR}\,{=}\,0.029$  ;   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,{=}\,0.004{-}0.234$  ;   $P\,{=}\,8.64\times10^{-4}\}$  ), which reached the significant threshold  of   $P\!=\!0.05/5$   MR methods  $=\!0.01$   (a Bonferroni-correction  for the testing of five MR methods) (Table  1 ). However,  there was no causal effect of HAA on risks of cerebral aneurysm   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.002$  ;  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\!=\!4.83\!\times\!10^{-6}\!-\!0.632$  ;  $P\!=\!0.035$  ),  ischemic stroke   $(\mathrm{OR}=2.887$  ;   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}=0.232–35.989$  ;   $P\,{=}\,0.410$  ), peripheral artery disease   $(\mathrm{OR}\,\mathrm{=}\,0.785$  ;   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}\,{=}\,0.004{-}154.327$  ;  $P\!=\!0.928)$  ), arrhythmia   $(\mathrm{OR}\!=\!0.733$  ;   $95\%$   $\operatorname{CI}\,{=}\,0.015{-}36.242$  ;   $P\!=\!0.876)$  ), and atrial fibrillation 

  $\mathrm{{OR}}=187.118$  ;   $95\%$     $\operatorname{CI}\,=\,0.104–3.36\times10^{5}$  ;   $P\,{=}\,0.171$  ) 

 (Table  1 ). Thus, these results suggested the causal protective effects of HAA on risks of CAD.  

In addition to the main analyses, the association results  from the simple mode, weighted mode, weighted median  and MR-Egger regression methods did not reach statistical  significance (all  $P\!>\!0.01$  ; Table  1 ), which might be due to  the insufficient power of these four methods (Bowden et al.  2016 ; Hartwig et al.  2017 ).  

# MR estimation of the causality of CVDs on HAA  

Next, we investigated the causality of six types of CVD on  HAA. We found that on the basis of the results from the  main analyses using IVW, there was no causal effect of HAA  on the six types of CVD (all  $P\!>\!0.05/5$   MR methods  $=\!0.01$  ;  Fig.  3 ). Forest plots and scatter plots for the overall causal  effects estimations are displayed in Fig.  3  and Supplementary Fig. 4, respectively. We observed a nominally statistically significant causal effect of CAD on HAA (OR, 0.997   $[95\%$   CI, 0.994–0.999],  $P{=}0.015$  ; Table  2 ). However, this  $P$    value did not reach the Bonferroni-corrected threshold. Further studies are needed to test whether there is a significant  causal effect of CAD on HAA.  

# Sensitivity analyses  

To evaluate the robustness of the causal effect estimates of  HAA on CVDs, and vice versa, we performed several sensitivity analyses, including the horizontal pleiotropy tests, heterogeneity tests and leave-one-out analyses. The MR Egger  intercept tests and MR-PRESSO suggested no horizontal  pleiotropy (all  $P\!>\!0.05$  ; Table  3 ). In the heterogeneity tests,  the Cochran's Q statistics for HAA-Arrhythmia and PADHAA showed significant he te rogen ei ties (all   $P<0.05$  ;  Table  3 ). To deal with the potential influence of heterogeneity, we introduced the random-effect IVW method (Bowden  and Holmes  2019 ). Alternatively, the fix-effect IVW method  was used as the main MR method. The leave-one-out analyses showed that any of the SNPs has little effect on the  overall effect of causal relationship (Supplementary Figs. 5  and 6). Taken together, these results suggested that our MR  results are robust to the violations of MR assumptions.  

# Discussion  

On the basis of the summary-level data from large-scale  GWASs, our bidirectional two-sample MR analyses investigated the potential causal role of HAA on a broad range  of CVDs, and vice versa. We identified significant causal  effects of HAA on the reduced risks of CAD by use of the  data from the largest GWASs to date. In contrast, there was  no statistically significant relationship between CVDs and  HAA. These findings might be helpful in developing the  strategies for the treatment and prevention of CAD.  

Earlier MR studies have uncovered the causal roles of  height, serum lipids, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and  type 2 diabetes on CAD (Wang et al.  2022 ). However, to the  best of our knowledge, there was no research that investigated the causal relationship between HAA and CAD, and  other types of CVD. Thus, our study was the first MR study  that assessed the causal effects of HAA on CVDs. Hypertension is an important risk factor of cardiovascular events.  Although the prevalence of hypertension among Tibetan  population aged  $\geq\!18$   years in China is  $36\%$  , which is higher  than the national hypertension prevalence rate of   $23.2\%$  (Wang et al.  2018 ), the higher prevalence of hypertension  in Tibetans than in other ethnic groups is based on data from  Tibetans at high altitudes and other ethnic groups at lower  altitudes. Actually, CAD and hypertension are influenced by  a wide range of factors, including genetics, diet, and other  various other variables (Li et al.  2012 ), and we also noticed  that the prevalence of hypertension among the Tibetan population living at high altitude was lower than that in the  Han population at high altitude (Shen et al.  2017 ). Intrigu- ingly, previous observational studies have revealed the statistical associations between HAA and CAD. For example,  epidemiological surveys demonstrated that the incidence  of CAD in Tibetan highlanders is significantly lower than  that in plain-living Japanese (Fujimoto et al.  1989 ). Consistently, record linkage studies reported the associations  between CAD mortality and HAA in American (Mortimer  et al.  1977 ) and European populations (Faeh et al.  2009 )  although the sample sizes of these studies were limited.

Five methods, including the inverse variance weighted (IVW), simple mode,  weighted mode, weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods,  were used for MR analyses.

The definitions of the CVDs cases and controls were described previously (PMID: 32,514,122 and PMID: 28,416,822). We conducted MR analyses using five different methods,  including IVW, simple mode, weighted mode, weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods. The IVW method was designated as the “main analyses” in this study. We conducted the  IVW method with the fixed or random effect model, according to the heterogeneity tests. In the heterogeneity tests in this study, the Cochran's Q statistics for PAD-HAA showed significant  he te rogen ei ties; thus, we conducted IVW method with the random effect model for PAD-HAA.

To evaluate the robustness of the causal effect estimates of HAA on CVDs, and vice versa, we performed  several sensitivity analyses, including the horizontal pleiotropy tests and heterogeneity tests. Horizontal  pleiotropy analyses were conducted by MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO methods, and the results  showed that there is no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy in IVs of either HAA or six types of CVD (all   $P\!>\!0.05)$  ). In the heterogeneity tests, the Cochran's Q statistics for HAA-Arrhythmia and PAD-HAA  showed significant he te rogen ei ties (all   $P\!<\!0.05$  ). If the   $P$   value of the heterogeneity is less than 0.05, the  final results of MR are referred to a random-effects model of IVW; and otherwise, a fixed-effects model  of IVW is used.

could potentially impact the relationship between living at  a moderately higher altitude and reduced risk of ischemic  heart disease (IHD). After carefully accounting for all other  environmental parameters, they revealed a inverse correlation between altitude and IHD risk (Faeh et al.  2016 ). These  findings have also been confirmed by more recent studies.  A nationwide population-based analysis spanning 17 years  in Ecuador indicated that residing at higher elevations is  associated with a decreased risk of stroke-related mortality  and hospitalization (Ortiz-Prado et al.  2021 ). A systematic  review suggested that prolonged living at higher altitudes  reduces the risk of developing stroke and mortality (OrtizPrado et al.  2022 ). The results from these observational  studies provided support for HAA being causally related  to the reduced risks of CAD. Moreover, the MR studies  using SNPs as IVs aim to identify the genetic causal link  between HAA and CAD. Therefore, our MR study showed  that genetic predisposition to HAA was genetically associated with reduced risks of CAD.  

From a mechanistic perspective, several pathways are  shared between HAA and CAD. It is well known that  the most significant factor of high altitude is hypoxia  (Pamenter et al.  2020 ). Genome scans have consistently  represented that hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and a  number of their upstream and downstream molecules play  critical roles in hypoxia adaptation among Tibetans, such  as  EPAS1  (Endo the li al PAS Domain Protein 1) and  EGLN1 (Egl-9 Family Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1) (Storz  2021 ).  HIFs are transcription factors that are active under hypoxia  condition, and induce expression of target genes that are  critical for cell survival under hypoxia, such as EPO (Storz  2021 ). HIFs also play a central role in the pathogen es is  and path o physiology of CAD (Li et al.  2020 ). For examples, HIF-1 is responsible for the pathological changes  of cardiovascular system, including injury, ang io genesis,  vascular remodeling, inflammatory response, and metabolic remodeling (Li et al.  2020 ). Besides HIFs pathway,  several other pathways are also simultaneously involved  in HAA and CAD, such as nitric oxide (NO) pathway.  NO pathway is an effector mediating the body's response  to hypoxia (Umbrello et al.  2013 ), while the release and  formation of NO is closely related to the pathogen es is of  CAD (Farah et al.  2018 ). Together, these findings provided  biological plausibility for the causal effects of the highaltitude hypoxia adaptation on CAD.  

Among six types of CVD including CAD, cerebral aneurysm, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, arrhythmia  and atrial fibrillation, we found that HAA is only causally  associated with CAD, instead of with other five types of  CVD. One possible reason for this is that these six types of  diseases are distinct CVDs with differences in their pathogenesis, symptoms, and clinical manifestations. CAD and  peripheral artery disease are at hero sclerotic CVDs, affecting  the coronary arteries and arteries in other parts of the body,  respectively. Cerebral aneurysm and ischemic stroke are  categorized as cerebro vascular diseases, while arrhythmia  and atrial fibrillation fall under electrocardiograph ic physiological CVDs. CAD is characterized by cardiac ischemia  and heart-related symptoms like chest pain, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction, whereas peripheral artery  disease presents with symptoms related to peripheral circulation disorders such as intermittent c lau dication, limb  weakness, numbness, and pain. Therefore, variations in  the pathological and clinical characteristics could potentially underlie the dissimilarities in the causal association  between HAA and six distinct types of CVDs. Furthermore,  similar to our study, other research has employed MR to  investigate the causal relationships between exposure and  a range of CVDs. For example, Susanna C. Larsson et al.  utilized MR to predict the effects of alcohol consumption  on multiple CVDs, including stroke, CAD, atrial fibrillation,  heart failure, venous thr ombo embolism, peripheral artery  disease, aortic valve stenosis, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. The results provided evidence of a causal relationship  between higher alcohol consumption and increased risk of  stroke and peripheral artery disease, but not other CVDs  (Larsson et al.  2020 ). Wichanon Sae-Jie et al. employed  MR to systematically investigate the potential causal role of  calcium calcification in the wall of arteries across a broad  range of at hero sclerotic CVDs including CAD, angina, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke,  and peripheral artery disease. However, the findings indicated a causal association between calcium calcification in  the wall of arteries and CAD, ischemic heart disease, and  angina pectoris, while no significant causal association was  observed between calcium calcification in the wall of arteries and ischemic stroke or peripheral artery disease (Sae-Jie  et al.  2022 ).In addition to the hypoxia, cold is another critical driver of adaptation to high altitude. There is unequivocal evidence that exposure to the low ambient temperatures  increases the cardiovascular risk of incidence and mortality  (Basu and Samet  2002 ). Cold exposure has been known to  increase several CAD-related phenotypes, including blood  pressure, heart rate, plasma fibrinogen, platelet viscosity and  peripheral va so constriction (Modesti et al.  2006 ). Mechanistically, cold adaptation may be associated with the risk  of CAD via several pathways. For examples, cold exposure  could stimulate functional conversion from white adipose  tissue into brown adipose tissue (BAT) through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) (Nedergaard et al.  2001 ). Previous  study has shown that inhibition of UCP1 could suppress  cold-induced UCP1-dependent lipolysis, which increased  plasma levels of small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) remnants and led to the at hero sclerotic cardiovascular diseases  in mouse models (Dong et al.  2013 ). Taken together, these  results supported that the adaption to the cold temperature  is associated with the reduced risk of CAD.  

Clinically, our MR findings suggested that an increased  ability of HAA has potential benefit to the prevention or clinical therapy of CAD. First, the causal association between  HAA and CAD might be helpful to identify candidate drugs  for CAD treatment. For example, drugs that mimic the protective effects of HAA could be developed to prevent or treat  CAD. This could open up new avenues for drug discovery  and development in CAD management. We also suggested  that the exercising in hypoxia can be an effective therapeutic  strategy for cardiovascular path o logie s (Casey and Joyner  2012 ; Montero and Lundby  2016 ). Together, adaptation to  hypoxia offered practical means of protecting myocardium  from impending ischemia, which may act as a potential  complement to the conventional pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for CAD. Second, HAA could be used as a  potential biomarker or risk assessment tool in clinical practice. Patients with a history of HAA, such as those living at  high altitudes, may be assessed for their hypoxia adaptation  status to determine their CAD risk profile. This could aid  in identifying high-risk individuals who may benefit from  early preventive interventions. Third, lifestyle modifications  could be recommended as part of CAD prevention strategies  for high-risk individuals. Lifestyle interventions that mimic  the effects of hypoxia, such as appropriate hypoxia training  (Richalet and Lhuissier  2015 ; Mallet et al.  2018 ,  2021 ) or  controlled intermittent hypoxic exposure, could be incorporated into CAD prevention plans. These interventions could  potentially enhance hypoxia adaptation and reduce the risk  of CAD development.  

There are some strengths in our study. First, this MR  study used the genetic variants as IVs, which are relatively  independent of the environmental factors, thereby balancing  the residual confounding that limits the typical observational  studies. Second, this study used the largest sample sizes to  date. Therefore, this study has a high statistical power to  detect the significant associations between HAA and CVDs.  Thirdly, we used a 2-sample MR study design that can costeffectively produce unbiased estimates to determine the  effects of HAA and the risk of CVDs.  

However, the present study must be interpreted within  the context of its limitations. First, because genetic analysis  was usually weak for detecting nonlinear effects and provided qualitative rather than quantitative information (Burgess et al.  2012 ), the clinical effects may be different from  the effect sizes of our genetic analysis. Second, because the  causal estimates with a binary exposure may represent the  average causal effects from disease liability (Burgess and  Labrecque  2018 ), the remaining possibility of the effects  from shared risk factors for HAA and CAD might be present. Given the above two limits, the clinical and biological  interpretation of the causal association findings in this study  should be cautious. Thirdly, due to unavailable GWAS summary data of HAA from other Tibetan populations, we were  not able to validate our MR results. Further MR studies are  needed to confirm the findings that HAA has a causal protective effect on CAD. Last, we only used the individuals from  Asian population in this study. In fact, the genetic studies on  HAA have indicated that different populations adapt to the  high-altitude environment in different ways (Beall  2007 ).  However, due to unavailable data, we were not able to investigate the MR results from the other highlanders, such as  Andean populations. Further studies extending the analyses  to the other ethnic highlander populations may be helpful in  confirming the generalization of the results.  

In conclusion, we provided genetic evidence that an  increased HAA ability could reduce the risks of CAD; in  contrast, there was no statistically significant relationship  between CVDs and HAA. These findings might be helpful in developing the effective prevention and intervention  strategies for CAD.
