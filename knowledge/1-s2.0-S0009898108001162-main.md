Background:  Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by endo the li al nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) plays a key role in vascular regulation and atherosclerosis, therefore, eNOS may be a candidate gene for ischemic stroke (IS). However, it is still controversial whether eNOS polymorphisms are a risk factor for IS. Methods:  Three polymorphisms of the eNOS gene   $(-922\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G},\,-786\mathsf{T}/\mathsf{C},\,894\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{T})$   were determined by using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay in 309 Chinese patients with IS and 309 Chinese controls. Results:  The frequency of eNOS  − 922 G allele was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the patients than the controls (  $.12.14\%$  vs  $8.09\%$  ,  $\scriptstyle P=0.018.$  ). The distribution of eNOS genotypes differed insigni ﬁ cantly between the 2 groups. The frequency of the eNOS  − 786 CC genotype was higher in the patients than the controls (  $.0\Re{=}3.819$  ,  $P{=}0.029]$  ). With respect to  $-922{\mathsf{A}}/{\mathsf{G}}$  , the   $\mathsf{A G}\!+\!\mathsf{G G}$   genotype increased the risk for IS (  $\mathrm{{.0R}}\!=\!1.523$  ,    $P{=}0.047$  ). After adjustment for confounding factors, the odds ratios of  − 786 CC and  $-922$   variant genotype   $(\mathsf{A G}+\mathsf{G G})$  ) for IS were 4.580 and 1.656, respectively. However, haplotype analysis revealed the frequencies of Hap4 (GCG) and Hap7 (GCT) were signi ﬁ cantly higher in the patients than the controls   $\scriptstyle{P=0.035}$  , 0.042). Conclusions:  eNOS  − 922A/G and    $-786{\mathrm{T}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   may affect the susceptibility to IS and certain haplotypes of the eNOS gene may be associated with a higher susceptibility to IS.

# 1. Introduction  

vasospasm, and atherosclerosis  [9 – 11] , while restoration of NO activity induces the regression of preexisting intimal lesions. Since endo the li al NO exerts a variety of protective effects, and since the contributions of eNOS to plasma NO metabolite levels have been con ﬁ rmed  [12,13] , the eNOS gene is a logical candidate gene for stroke susceptibility.  

Ischemic cerebro vascular disease is known to be a multi factorial disorder. Ischemic stroke (IS) usually results from atherosclerosis, heart disease, vasculitis, hypertension, smoking or other etiologies. It has been found recently that genetic factors may play a role in IS  [1,2] through endo the li al dysfunction. Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized from  L - arginine by endo the li al nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a key mediator of endo the li al function, which plays a central role in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis, including regulation of cerebral circulation [3 – 5] . NO also relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), inhibits adhesion of platelets and monocytes to the endothelium, reduces the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and slows down at hero genesis  [6,7] . Atherosclerosis, one of the major causes of IS, is considered to be an in ﬂ ammatory disease which induces arterial stenosis/occlusion. It has been con ﬁ rmed that endo the li al dysfunction is the initial event of atherosclerosis. In animal models, eNOS inhibition accelerates at hero genesis  [8] . It was shown that a reduction in NO release makes humans predispose to stroke, hypertension, thrombosis,  

eNOS is expressed in endo the li al cells, platelets, and the heart, and it is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 7q35 to 7q36, spanning 21 kb and comprising 26 exons (GenBank D26607)  [14,15] . Several SNPs have been identi ﬁ ed in the promoter, exons, and introns of the eNOS gene. G894T in exon 8 ((also named rs1799983) of the eNOS gene leads to a change of Glu to Asp at site 298. It has been demonstrated that this polymorphism alters eNOS activity and may be associated with a reduction in the basal NO production  [16] . The mutant T allele was reported to be associated with hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD)  [17] , stroke  [18] , and the number of stenotic vessels. Another eNOS gene polymorphism, T-786C (also referred to as rs2070744) located in the promoter region of the eNOS gene, results from replacement of a thymidine by a cytosine at nucleotide  − 786. It was reported that the T-786C polymorphism may change eNOS gene expression and result in a signi ﬁ cant reduction in the eNOS gene promoter activity  [19] . The T-786C polymorphism was also demonstrated to be associated with an increased predisposition to CAD in Chileans and Koreans  [20,21] , to IS in young black women  [22] , to coronary spasm in Japanese, and to myocardial infarction (MI) in Koreans  [19,23] , but not to increase the predisposition to MI and CAD in other Caucasians  [24,25] . The A-922G polymorphism (also named rs1800779) was identi ﬁ ed also in the promoter region of the eNOS gene. It is in linkage d is equilibrium with T-786C in Japanese. Ma et al. demonstrated no association between the A-922G polymorphism of the eNOS gene and hypertension  [26] . However, Howard et al. reported that the  − 922G/A and  $-786{}\mathrm{T}/\mathsf{C}$   polymorphisms may be associated with IS among black women  [22] . Additionally, the  − 786T/C polymorphism was found to be in linkage d is equilibrium with eNOS4b/a allele, but not with 894T allele, in Japanese and Koreans  [27,28] , suggesting the  $-786{}\mathrm{T}/\mathsf{C}$  mutation to be the functional locus of the eNOS4b/a VNTR marker. The present study was aimed to further evaluate the possible association between the three polymorphisms of the eNOS gene and IS in Chinese patients.  

# 2. Subjects and methods  

# 2.1. Subjects  

This study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Department of Science and Technology of Shenzhen City and the local Ethics Committees of all the participating hospitals. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Cases and controls were Han people recruited consecutively from the same geographic region from September 2003 to September 2005 in Shenzhen City. A 1:1 matched case-control study was performed. Patients were those with new-onset ischemic stroke registered in either of the 2 general hospitals in Shenzhen City. Three hundred nine patients were recruited consecutively (male,  $61.49\%$  , female,   $38.51\%$  , mean age,  $61.34~\mathrm{y.}$  ). The patients were residents of Shenzhen City who had vascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyper cho lesterolemia, or diabetes, but no history of IS. Other exclusion criteria included cancer or autoimmune disease including anti phospholipid antibody syndrome, and cerebral embolism caused byarterial  ﬁ brillation, as diagnosed by electrocardiograph y, CT, or MRI. However, patients with de ﬁ nitely diagnosed cerebral thrombosis were included. IS was diagnosed by thorough neurological examinations (CT, MRI or both) according to the International Classi ﬁ cation of Diseases (9th Ed.). The patients were enrolled 1 week after IS. The community controls (  $.N{=}309$  , male,  $61.49\%$  ; female,  $38.51\%$  ; mean age,  $61.03\;\mathrm{y}$  ) without a history of stroke were recruited from the same geographic region as were the patients. The controls had no clinical evidence of neurological disease and were matched by age   $(\pm5\mathrm{~y})$  ), sex, ethnic origin, and residence area. The controls with a history of cardiovascular disease other than stroke were eligible. The cases and controls were interviewed by investigators using the same structured questionnaire.  

# 2.2. Data collection and de ﬁ nition of risk factors  

Information on demographic characteristics and other risk factors was collected by use of a structured questionnaire involving the history of hypertension, diabetes, angina pectoris or myocardial infarction, alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, tea drinking, and physical exercise, the family history, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference (WHR). WHR was measured using a  ﬁ berglass tape over one layer of clothing. Hip circumference was measured at the level of the great trochanter or approximately 4 in. below the waistline. WHR was calculated as follows: WHR  $\cdot^{-}$  waist circumference/hip circumference.  

Hypertension was de ﬁ ned as a history of treated hypertension. Diabetes was diagnosed if a fasting glucose level of  $\mathrm{>}7.8\;\mathrm{mmol/l}$   or a glucose level of  $\mathrm{\ddot{\rho}}\!>\!11.1\ \mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{l}$   at  $2\;\mathrm{~h~}$   after oral glucose challenge, or both. The history of myocardial infarction, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass surgery, or lower limb arterial disease was recorded. A positive cardiovascular history was de ﬁ ned as the presence of any of the above-mentioned diseases. If a subject had smoked at least 1 cigarette per day for at least 1 y and had not quitted smoking by now, he/she was de ﬁ ned a current smoker. Alcohol drinking and tea drinking were also classi ﬁ ed accordingly. In this study, negative life events were de ﬁ ned as serious illnesses, decease of relatives, separation, divorce, frustrations in work, unemployment, retirement, natural or social disasters, and economic dif ﬁ culties in the last two months. Negative life events were recorded as 1 if a subject suffered from at least 1 negative life event.  

# 2.3. Biochemical parameters and genotyping  

Venous blood samples were drawn into tubes containing EDTA after at least 12 to 14 h of fasting. Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) were measured using enzymatic methods. Serum glucose was measured using a glucose oxidase procedure. In case of acute or other emergencies, blood samples were collected 6 days later.  

DNA was extracted from lymphocytes isolated from  $3\;\mathrm{{ml}}$   of blood sample using a commercially available DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Gentra Systems, Inc.). DNA samples were stored at    $-80\ \ {}^{\circ}C.$   According to the information in the NCBI SNP database, SNPs which had a minor allele frequency of  $>10\%$   or those established in the literature were chosen. We selected three SNPs of the human eNOS gene to determine the association between patients with IS and controls. In the present study, 3 SNPs were named rs1800779, rs1799983, and rs2070744. Rs1800779 and rs2070744, also called A-922G and T-786C, were located in the   $5^{\prime}$  ﬂ anking region of this gene. rs1799983, located in exon 7, was also called G894T polymorphism. Each SNP was genotyped by using conventional TaqMan minor groove binding (MGB) probes, which were commercially supplied by Shanghai GeneCore Bio technologies. TaqMan SNP genotyping was performed by Taq ampli ﬁ cation. In the  $5^{\prime}$  nuclease assay, discrimination occurred during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) because allele-speci ﬁ c  ﬂ uoroscence probes were cleaved by the   $5^{\prime}$   nuclease activity of Taq polymerase when hybridized to the template. The probes contained a   $3^{\prime}$   MGB which hybridized to single-stranded targets with a high sequence speci ﬁ city compared with conventional TaqMan probes. This reduced nonspeci ﬁ c probe hybridization and resulted in a low  ﬂ uorescence background during the 5 ′ nuclease PCR assay. Cleavage resulted in an increased emission of the reporter dye. Each SNP genotype required two unlabeled PCR primers and two allele-speci ﬁ c probes. Each probe was doubly labeled with reporter dyes at the  $5^{\prime}$   end. In the present study, the   $5^{\prime}$   end of the two probes was labeled with FAM and HEX respectively.  

# 2.4. eNOS A-922G, eNOS T-786C, and eNOS G894T genotyping  

eNOS A-922G polymorphism was analyzed by conventional TaqMan-MGB. PCR reaction was performed using the following primers: forward:   $5^{\prime}$  -GCCCAGCTAG TG GCC TTT CT-3 ′ , reverse:   $5^{\prime}$  -CCA GC ACT CT CCA G GC ACT T $.3^{\prime}$  ; probes for detection of the A-922G polymorphism were FAM-TC AG AT GA CACA GA ACT-MGB and HEX-AGATGGCACAGAACT-MGB.  

For eNOS T-786C polymorphism, the primers were: forward:   $5^{\prime}$  -T CCC ACCA GG GCATCAA-3 ′ , reverse:  $5^{\prime}$  -GG A CACA AAA GAG CA G GAA GC T $.3^{\prime}$  ; probes for detection of the T-786C polymorphism were FAM-TTC CC TG GCC GG CT-MGB and HEXTTC CC TG GC TG GC T-MGB. For eNOS G894T polymorphism the primers were: forward:  $5^{\prime}$  -CCC CACA GC TC TG CAT TC AG -3 ′ , reverse: 5 ′ -C TT GC A GG CCC TTC TT GAGA $.3^{\prime}$  ; probes for detection of the G894T polymorphism were FAM-CCA GAT GAG CCCC CA G-MGB and HEXCCA GAT GAT CCCC CA-MGB.  

Polymerase chain reaction was accomplished by using   $10~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of Premix ExTaq ™ (Code No: DRR039A) (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Dalian, China) in a  $20~\upmu\mathrm{l}$   ﬁ nal volume, with 50 ng DNA templates,  $200\;\mathrm{nm}/1$   primers, and   $100\;\mathrm{nm}/1$   probes ( ﬁ nal concentration) according to the TaKaRa protocol ( http://www.takara.com.cn ). Ampliﬁ cation was carried out in a Stratagene   $\mathrm{Mx4000}$   system by using the following cycle: initial de natura tion at  $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 10 s, de natura tion at  $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $5\:s$  , re association at  $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  for  $32\ s$   (40 cycles) according to TaKaRa protocol (DRR039A).

# 3. Statistical analysis  

Epidata 3.0 was used to establish the database. Differences in the allele and genotype frequencies of rs1800779, rs2070774 and rs1799983 between IS patients and controls were calculated using a  $\chi^{2}$    or Fisher's exact test. The    $\chi^{2}$    test was used to test for deviation of genotype distribution from Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium. All continuous variables were expressed as mean  $\pm S\mathrm{E}$   unless otherwise indicated. Categorical variables were assessed by    $\chi^{2}$    test or Fisher's exact test. Based on the genotype data, a haplotype-based case-control study were performed using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. In addition, multivariate conditional regression analyses were performed to assess the independent role of the eNOS genotype and other risk factors. Odds ratios with  $95\%$  con ﬁ dence intervals   $\mathbf{\Delta}.95\%$  CI) were calculated to test the association between risk factors and IS. All the statistical tests were performed using SPSS software for Windows (ver 12.0). A 2-tailed    $P$   value    ${<}0.05$   was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant. Haplotype analyses of the three eNOS SNPs were performed using Whap program ( http://www.broad.mit.edu/ personal/shaun/whap/ )  [29] .  

# 4. Results  

# 4.1. Characteristics of subjects  

As shown in  Table 1 , there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in age, income per month, history of heart disease, and cholesterol content between the 2 groups, but there were signi ﬁ cant differences in BMI  $(P{=}0.011)$  ) and WHR   $\scriptstyle\left(P<0.001\right)$  ), suggesting BMI and WHR to be risk factors of IS. The prevalence of conventional risk factors for vascular disease was higher in the patient group, and these risk factors included a family history of diabetes, a history of hypertension and diabetes, smoking, alcohol drinking, and an increased triglyceride level.  

# 4.2. Distribution of eNOS polymorphisms  

As shown in  Table 2 , the 3 eNOS gene polymorphisms distributed in accordance with Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium in both groups, except eNOS rs1800779 and rs2070744 polymorphisms in the patient group   $\scriptstyle{P=0.004}$   and 0.003, respectively). There was no signi ﬁ cant difference in the distributions of eNOS    $-786{\mathrm{T}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   (rs2070744)  $(P{=}0.090)$   and G894T (rs1799983,  $P{=}0.649$  ) between both groups. For eNOS  − 922A/G (rs1800779), the frequency of the GG genotype of

a adjusted for smoking (0, negative; 1, positive), alcohol drinking (0, negative; 1, positive), history of hypertension (0, negative; 1, positive), historyof diabetes (0, negative; 1, positive), family history of hypertension (0, negative; 1, positive), family history of diabetes (0, negative; 1, positive), triglyceride, HDL, and LDL. b reference group.  

the eNOS gene was slightly higher in the patients than the controls  $\scriptstyle{P=0.081}$  ). The frequency of the G allele increased in the patient group compared to the control group (  $12.14\%$   vs   $8.09\%$  ) and the odds ratio of the G allele to the A allele was 1.57 (  $\scriptstyle{P=0.018}$  ).  

# 4.3. Association of genotypes with the risk of IS  

Crude and adjusted ORs for IS were used with and without adjustment for confounding factors. As shown in  Table 3 , after adjustment for smoking (0, negative; 1 positive), history of hypertension (0, negative; 1, positive), history of diabetes (0, negative; 1 positive), family history of hypertension (0, negative; 1, positive), and alcohol drinking (0, negative; 1 positive) by multiple logistic regression analysis, no signi ﬁ cant higher risk was found in the G894T genotype or the combinations of some genotypes   $\scriptstyle\left(P>0.05\right)$  . Without adjustment for other confounding factors, eNOS  − 786 CC genotype showed an odds ratio of 3.819   $'P{=}0.029)$   to eNOS  − 786 TT. After adjustment for the above-mentioned confounding factors, the odds ratio of  − 786 CC genotype to the TT genotype was 4.580. For the eNOS  − 922A/G polymorphism, eNOS variant genotype (  $\mathsf{'G G}\!+\!\mathsf{A G}.$   was

After adjustment for confounding factors, the odds ratio for IS was 1.656 if the subjects had eNOS variant genotype   $\scriptstyle{P=0.048.}$  ).  

# 4.4. Haplotype analysis  

We used Whap software to analyze the haplotypes based on the observed genotypes. Seven common potential haplotypes in the patients and controls were presented in  Table 4 , denoted by the allele at positions  − 922,  − 786, and 894. Compared with controls, there was no signi ﬁ cant difference in the distributions of haplotypes in the patients and controls   $'P{=}0.986'$  ). However, the frequencies of Hap4 (GCG) and Hap7 (GCT) were signi ﬁ cantly higher in the patients than the controls   $\scriptstyle{P=0.035}$  , 0.005). Compared with Hap1 allele   $(-922\mathrm{\A},$  ,

 − 786 T, 894G), Hap4 allele was associated with an increased risk of IS

 (  $\begin{array}{r}{0\mathbb{R}\!=\!1.547,}\end{array}$  ,  $95\%{\tt C I}\!=\!1.029$   2.324). Of the patient group, 4 had Hap7 and 3 had Hap6. The association of haplotypes 4, 6 and 7 with IS was signi ﬁ cant. The frequencies of Hap3 (ACG) was signi ﬁ cantly lower in the patients than the controls (  $\mathord{\left.\mathrm{OR}\right=}0.438$  ,  $P{=}0.047$  ).  

# 5. Discussion  

Gene variations may induce pathological changes of intra cranial vessels, resulting in cerebral hemorrhage and IS  [30] . These pathologies, however, may also result from systemic vascular diseases caused by variants or polymorphisms of genes that regulate cardio vascular physiology, blood coagulation, lipid metabolism, and metabolic function. Stroke is a major cause for mortality and disability in the elderly in China. The incidence rate of stroke is about   $170.3/$  100,000 and stroke is the second cause for death, just behind malignant tumors, in China. Cerebral infarction is caused by a reduction in oxygen and glucose availability resulting from systemic vascular diseases such as large vessel emboli and atherosclerosis or from intra cranial vascular diseases. In addition to the commonly recognized environmental risk factors, there has been increasing evidence for the role of genes in the path o physiology of cerebrovascular disease  [2] . IS is a multi factorial disease with racial or ethnic differences. Moreover, the frequencies of eNOS gene polymorphisms have been reported to vary among ethnic groups  [31] . Some recent studies have implicated eNOS polymorphisms in the development of IS  [18,32,33] , and it is possible that ethnic differences in NO-mediated effects may result from a disproportionate distribution of eNOS variants among ethnic groups  [34] .  

Some polymorphisms have been identi ﬁ ed in the eNOS gene and addressed possible relationships with coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, and intra cranial aneurysm  [35] . The Glu298Asp polymorphism (rs1799983) is the only common variant identi ﬁ ed so far in the coding region of eNOS gene, which alters the function of the gene. For instance, associations have been reported between this polymorphism and the eNOS activity [16,36]  or endo the li al function. The possible mechanism involved is that eNOS Glu298Asp might reduce NO bio availability. Rs1799983 in the eNOS gene is subject to selective pro teo ly tic cleavage in endo the li al cells and vascular tissues, which may lead to a reduced production of vascular NO  [16,36] . Despite the substantial evidence that endo the li al dysfunction and vascular in ﬂ ammation accelerates at hero genesis, few studies have been conducted among IS patients. In the present study, we explored the association of G894T with IS. The study did not reveal the difference in the alleles and genotypes between the two groups. Similarly, it was found that the G894T polymorphism in the eNOS gene was not involved in the susceptibility to ischemic cerebro vascular disease  [22,33] . However, analysis of this polymorphism in a French Caucasian population showed an association with ischemic infarction, especially with lacunar stroke  [37] . Some epidemiological studies showed con ﬂ icting results on the association between these functional polymorphisms and IS. Few studies have been conducted on the association of these polymorphisms with IS risks among Chinese IS patients. Recent meta-analyses of association of eNOS gene polymorphisms with IS in Caucasians indicated no association between G894T polymorphism and stroke [31,32] , whereas signi ﬁ cant association of G894T with IS was observed in a Chinese population   $\mathrm{{'OR}}\!=\!2.39.$  ) . In the present study, we examined the association between G894T and IS in Chinese subjects. Our results showed the T allele frequency of the G894T polymorphism to be similar between IS patients and controls, a  ﬁ nding consistent with Dutra et al. Likewise, Hassan et al. found no trend for this locus to be associated with NO x  levels, which would argue that is nonfunctional  [18] . Similarly, functional genetic study does not suggest any biological effect of the eNOS Glu298Asp genotype on the cardiovascular system via an in ﬂ uence on endothelium-dependent va so dilation [39] . In contrast, an analysis of this polymorphism revealed homozygosity for Asp298, a common variant of the eNOS gene, was an independent risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis in an Italy population  [40] , which is in agreement with the study indicating that the G894T polymorphism was signi ﬁ cantly associated with coronary collateral development  [41] .  

Recently, 2 eNOS gene variants   $(-922\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{G},\,-786~\mathsf{T}/\mathsf{C})$   in the   $5^{\prime}.$  - ﬂ anking region were reported to be signi ﬁ cantly associated with coronary spasm and myocardial infarction in Japanese and Korean populations and coronary artery disease in an Italian population.  $-786{\mathrm{T}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   was reported to decrease the promoter activity.  − 786C mutation was reported to reduce the eNOS gene promoter activity by  $\sim\!50\%$   in human umbilical endo the li al cells  [19] , and possibly decrease NO production. In the present study, we explored the association between the    $-786{\mathrm{T}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   and    $-922{\mathsf{A}}/{\mathsf{G}}$   polymorphisms and IS in a Chinese population. Our results revealed that without adjustment for other confounding factors, eNOS  − 786 CC genotype showed an odds ratio of 3.819   $(P{=}0.029)$   to eNOS  − 786 TT genotype. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that  − 786CC genotype was an independent genetic factor for IS (  $.08\!=\!4.580$  ,  $P{=}0.047]$  ) compared with TT genotype after adjustment for other confounding factors. Similarly, Xiang et al. found that the T786C polymorphism increases the risk for coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetes  [42] . Jo et al. found  − 786CTC and  − 922AG to completely link with each other in Koreans  [23] . Furthermore, these 2 polymorphisms were associated with the risk of myocardial infarction. Nakayama et al. found that the    $-786{\mathrm{T}}/{\mathsf{C}}$  polymorphism of the eNOS gene contributes to coronary artery disease  [19] , which was in agreement with the  ﬁ ndings of TanusSantos et al.  [34] . However, many studies coincided with the results of Nassar et al. and suggested that the  − 786T/C polymorphism of the eNOS gene does not contribute to premature coronary artery disease [43] . Jaramillo et al. found no evidence of association of this polymorphism with coronary artery disease in Chileans  [20] . Paradossi et al. did not observe any effect of the  $-786{\mathrm{T}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   polymorphism on endo the li al function  [44] .  

It has been shown that the eNOS gene is involved in the pathogen es is of stroke. However, many  ﬁ ndings are not reproducible due to a number of confounding variables (e.g., age, sex, and ethnic backgrounds). If we only explore the association of speci ﬁ c polymorphisms of the certain gene and stroke, the bene ﬁ ts of study on association between gene polymorphisms and diseases are probably low. In addition, the diversity of the results concerning common polymorphisms such as    $-786{\mathrm{T}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   or G894T of the eNOS gene was thought to be related to the gene – gene and gene – environment interactions. Szolnoki et al. found recently that the eNOS G894T variation in combination with the MTHFR 677TT or ACE D/D genotype increases the risk of stroke  [32] . Alvarez et al. also observed a synergistic effect between  $-786{\mathrm{T}}/{\mathsf{C}}$   of the eNOS gene and insertion/ deletion polymorphisms of the ACE gene on early-onset coronary artery disease  [45] .  

Our study has several limitations. It is possible that multiple rare eNOS mutations in ﬂ uence endo the li al function measures. It should be noted that the sample size was relatively small and the ethnic makeup of the subjects was different in the present study. Second, the patients were mainly elderly and Han people living in South China, possibly compromising the representative ness in terms of age and ethnic backgrounds. Third, by controlling the false-positive rate through empirical methods, we may have increased the false-negative rate. In addition, a rigid adherence to an empirical signi ﬁ cance level of  $\scriptstyle{P<0.05}$  may be too conservative and obscure some true positive associations. Meanwhile, the present study also has several strengths: (1) All IS patients were diagnosed with MRI or CT by two neurological specialists according to well-de ﬁ ned diagnostic criteria. (2) Laboratory genotyping was performed in a blind manner, minimizing measurement bias. (3) All IS patients and controls had a similar ethnic background, limiting the possible confounding effects (e.g., age, sex).

 (4) The relative high OR   $\left(=\!3.819\right)$   and low    $P$   value   $\left(=\!0.029\right)$   of the

 − 786CC genotype indicate a signi ﬁ cant association with an increased risk of IS. Thus, we demonstrated the association of eNOS gene polymorphisms with IS in this Chinese population.  

In summary, this study supports the association of eNOS gene polymorphisms with the risk of IS in the study population. In order to con ﬁ rm the signi ﬁ cance of these observed polymorphisms, welldesigned, case-control or prospective studies with large numbers of carefully selected patients and controls are to be carried out using appropriate molecular methods and statistical methods.
