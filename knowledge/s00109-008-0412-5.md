Abstract  In two independent human cohorts, the minor allele of SNP rs3850641 in  TNFSF4  was significantly more frequent in individuals with myocardial infarction than in controls. In mice, Tnfsf4 expression is associated with increased atherosclerosis. The expression of TNFSF4 in human atherosclerosis and the association between genotype and cerebro vascular disease have not yet been investigated. TNFSF4 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were significantly higher in human at hero sclerotic lesions compared with controls (  $730{\pm}30\$   vs  $330{\pm}65$   arbitrary units,  $p{<}0.01\rangle$  ). TNFSF4 was mainly expressed by macrophages in at hero sclerotic lesions. In cell culture, endo the li al cells up regulated TNFSF4 in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF $_{\alpha}$  ;   $460\!\pm\!110$   vs  $133\pm8$   arbitrary units,  $p{<}0.001$  after  $6\textup{h}$   of stimulation). We analyzed the  TNFSF4  gene in

239 patients who had undergone carotid end art erect o my and 138 matching controls from The Biobank of Karolinska Carotid End art erect o mies and Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program cohorts and 929 patients and 1,382 matching controls from the Sahl gren ska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke and Case Control Study of Stroke cohorts, limiting inclusion to patients with ischemic stroke. Participants were genotyped for the rs3850641 SNP in  TNFSF4 . Genotype associations were neither found with TNFSF4 mRNA levels nor with atherosclerosis associated systemic factors or risk for stroke. This study shows that TNFSF4 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells in human carotid at hero sclerotic lesions but provides no evidence for an association of  TNFSF4  gene variation with the risk for ischemic stroke.

# Introduction  

Stroke is a major cause of death and disability in Western countries and the third leading cause of death in the USA. Every year, 700,000 individuals in the USA suffer a new stroke of whom 150,000 people die [ 1 ]. Ischemic stroke is the most common form of stroke, which is predominantly caused by at hero thrombosis. Several genetic determinants contribute to the risk of stroke. Studies of twins, siblings, and families have provided significant evidence for genetic heritability, but the genes involved have not been identified. Environmental risk factors and inflammation interact with genetic risk factors to cause stroke [ 2 ].  

Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease. Immunocompetent cells, including T cells and macrophages, are recruited to the lesions through an activated endothelium. Activated immune cells produce pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which promote local inflammation and cellular influx to the vessel wall [ 3 ]. These events in the inflammatory process are also largely responsible for plaque rupture and thrombus formation, which clinically present as ischemia, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke [ 3 – 5 ].  

Activation of Tcells, the central orchestrator s of the adaptive immune response, is critically dependent on co-sti mula tory signals, which are mediated through, among others, molecules of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily [ 6 ]. Several members of this family have been implicated in at hero scl erosis, for example CD40/CD40 ligand [ 7 ], LIGHT [ 8 ,  9 ], TNFRSF4/TNFSF4 [ 10 ,  11 ], and CD137 [ 12 ].  

The minor allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) number rs3850641 in  TNFSF4  ( OX40L ) has been associated with increased risk of MI in women [ 11 ], and a polymorphism of this gene may be associated with stroke in diabetic patients [ 13 ]. In murine models of atherosclerosis, alterations of Tnfsf4 function have profound effects on disease development [ 11 ,  14 ]. However, it is not known whether TNFSF4 is expressed in human at hero sclerotic lesions and whether the  TNFSF4  genotype influences levels of TNFSF4 locally in lesions or alters systemic factors with effects on disease manifestations. Furthermore, the effect of the  TNFSF4  genotype on ischemic stroke has, to our knowledge, not previously been investigated.  

In this study, three human cohorts were investigated for the association between  TNFSF4  genotype and risk for carotid artery disease or ischemic stroke and one cohort for the expression of TNFSF4 and the association between  TNFSF4 genotype and TNFSF4 expression in atherosclerosis and systemic atherosclerosis related factors.  

# Materials and methods  

The studies were approved by the regional ethics committees for human and animal studies, respectively. Subjects were included after informed consent.  

Human specimen collection  

Samples were obtained from three Swedish cohorts. (1) The first was from  The Biobank of Karolinska Carotid Endartere c to mies  (BiKE). All patients diagnosed with   ${>}80\%$  carotid artery stenosis referred to the Department of Vascular Surgery at the Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Stockholm for surgical treatment of the stenosis were invited to participate in BiKE. Consecutive patients since 2001 were included and underwent standard endarterectomy. The dropout frequency was  ${\sim}2\%$   and mainly due to random erroneous sample handling. Biopsies of atherosclerotic carotid arteries and blood samples were collected, saved in the biobank, and linked to a database with clinical parameters. Per operatively, plaques were immediately rinsed in ice-cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cut transversely across the most prominent region. Three quarters of the specimen was instantly frozen on dry ice for later isolation of total RNA. One fourth, including part of the lesion extending into the internal carotid artery, was frozen in OCT for morphological analysis. A blood sample was also drawn. Furthermore, eight biopsies from normal iliac arteries of transplant donors without macro- or microscopic signs of atherosclerosis were included as controls. After surgical removal, this tissue was dissected in ice-cold RNAse free PBS and the vessel split using blunt dissection between intima and adventitia. The adventitia was discarded, and the remaining tissue was snap frozen. RNA was isolated and quality controlled as described below. Global messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was investigated using the Affymetrix GeneChip® Technology in 47 of the patient biopsies and seven of the control biopsies.  

In this study, RNA from 144 human carotid biopsies and eight controls was included together with the Affymetrix data. DNA was included from 239 BiKE patients and 138 age- and sex-matched individuals free from evident cardiovascular disease from the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program (SHEEP), which served as controls [ 15 ]. (2) Samples were also obtained from the case – control  Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke  (SAHLSIS) with DNA and clinical data from 600 patients and 600 matched controls and from (3) the prospective  Case Control Study of Stroke (CASTRO) Cohort , from which DNA from 393 patients suffering from stroke and 782 controls was available for investigation. The SAHLSIS [ 16 ] and CASTRO [ 17 ] samples were previously described.  

In addition, seven patients scheduled for nephrectomy and five patients scheduled for carotid end art erect o my due to symptomatic disease were included, from whom fresh biopsies from the normal renal artery or at hero sclerotic carotid artery, respectively, were cultured. These biopsies were split and incubated with or without bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from  Escherichia coli , O55:B5 (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at   $100~\mathrm{ng/mL}$   for  $6\textup{h}$  . Fresh renal artery biopsies were also embedded in OCT for immuno his to chemistry.  

Genotyping  

DNA was extracted from whole blood or peripheral blood monocytic cells isolated by cent ri fuga tion using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Patients were genotyped for a SNP in the  TNFSF4 gene using an ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and genotyping assay on demand (Applied Biosystems). The selected rs3850641 SNP is positioned in intron 1 and was chosen for its association with MI in two previous case – control studies [ 11 ]. Genotype determination was performed using an ABI fluorescence-based allelic discrimination method (Applied Biosystems) using forward primer GG GAA AGT GG A ACT G GTC TC TT, reverse prim- er TC ACT TT GAA GC TTT GA GTC ACT GA, and probes VIC-A CAT TACT AT CACA AT GG G TAG and FAM-CAT TACT AT CACA GT GG G TAG.  

# RNA isolation  

Frozen plaques were cut to small pieces on dry ice and transferred to FastPrep shaking tubes containing ceramic beads (Qbiogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and an equal volume of RLT-lysis buffer (Qiagen) and phenol. The tissue was disrupted using a FastPrep FP120 (Qbiogene; shaking conditions,  $20\,\mathrm{s},6.0\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$  , six iterations with 2-min incubation time on ice between shakes). Subsequently, samples were centrifuged for   $15\;\mathrm{\min}$   at   $^{9,600\times g,}$  ,   $+4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Super nat ants were transferred to micro centrifuge tubes, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol, including DNase treatment. Finally, the RNA was eluted with RNase-free water. The RNA quantity and quality were determined using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and an Agilent Bio analyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), respectively.  

# Gene array hybridization and analysis  

Bio tiny late d RNA was generated using   $10~\upmu\mathrm{g}$   of total RNA. The cRNA targets were then fragmented according to the Affymetrix® protocol. Fragmented biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix HG_U133 Plus 2.0 Genechip® arrays, stained, washed, and scanned according to the standard Affymetrix protocol. All samples were scanned with the same instrument. Raw data files were generated using Affymetrix software and hybridization signals normalized using the Robust Microarray Analyis algorithm and analyzed as previously described [ 18 ].  

Semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR  

mRNA levels were assessed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the corresponding cDNA [ 19 ]. Primers and probes were purchased as assay-on-demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Samples were analyzed in duplicates using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). Results were normalized to values for human cy clo phil in A for all samples, except the cultured human biopsies, which were normalized to values for    $\upbeta$  -actin. For in vitro experiments, data from different sets of experiments were normalized to a common baseline.  

Cell culture  

Human umbilical vein endo the li al cells (HUVEC) were maintained in endo the li al basal medium-2 (both from Cambrex Bio Science Walkers ville, Walkers ville, MA, USA). The following incubation s were performed: medium only, TNF $_{\cdot\alpha}$   (PeproTech EC Ltd, London, UK) at   $10\;\mathrm{{ng/mL}}$  or LPS at   $100\ \mathrm{ng/mL}$  . Experiments were repeated at least three times.  

# Histology  

Immuno fluorescence  Formalin-fixed   $10{\mathrm{-}}{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$   cry o sections were incubated with Image-IT Enhancer (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and then with   $10\%$   goat serum for   $30~\mathrm{\min}$   at room temperature. Subsequently, sections were incubated with a monoclonal mouse antihuman TNFSF4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) antibody or an isotype control (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) at  $+4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   overnight. Binding was detected by a Texas Red conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). After this first staining, sections were blocked using an Avidin – Biotin blocking kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions and another block with   $10\%$   goat serum at room temperature for  $30~\mathrm{\min}$  . Subsequently, a second primary antibody was added: rabbit anti-human    $_{\alpha}$  -actin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), CD68 (Dakopatts), von Willebrand factor (Dakopatts), or the corresponding isotype control (Abcam or Dakopatts). Binding of the second primary antibody was visualized using a goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen).  

Nuclei were stained using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenyl indole di hydrochloride (DAPI; Invitrogen). Dako fluorescent mounting medium (Dakopatts) was used for mounting. All antibodies were diluted in   $0.1\%$   saponin (Sigma) in PBS.  

Immuno his to chemistry  Formalin-fixed   $10{\mathrm{-}}{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$   cry o sections were blocked in   $0.3\%$     $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$   for   $30~\mathrm{min}$   and then with the Avidin – Biotin blocking kit (Vector Labs) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions. Sections were incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-human TNFSF4 (R&D Systems), CD68, von Willebrand factor, or an isotype control antibody (all three from Dakopatts) at   $+4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   overnight. Binding was detected using a bio tiny late d horse anti-mouse antibody, and slides were incubated with avidin – biotin peroxidase complexes (ABC Elite Kit, Vector Labs) for  $30\,\mathrm{\min}$  , followed by visualization with 3,3-di amino benz idine tetra hydrochloride (Vector Labs) and counter staining with he mato xy lin. All antibodies were diluted in   $0.1\%$  saponin (Sigma) in PBS. Slides were mounted using Pertex mounting medium (HistoLab products AB, Gothenburg, Sweden).  

Images were produced in a Leica DMRB microscope with a  $2.5\!\times\!/0.07$   objective equipped with a Leica DC480 camera or a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope with a  $40\times/1.25–0.75$   or a   $63\!\times\!/1.4\!\!-\!\!0.6$   immersion objective using the Leica Application Suite program, version 1.8.0:1346, followed by computer-assisted image analysis including overlaying of acquired color layers and adjustment of brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop CS2.  

Statistics  

Student ’ s    $t$   test was used for comparisons between two groups. Factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher ’ s least significance difference test was used to analyze TNFSF4 expression in cell cultures. Allele frequencies were estimated by gene counting, and deviation from Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium was analyzed using the  $\chi^{2}$    test. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between the presence of the minor allele and the case – control variable. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to analyze the effects of body mass index (BMI), smoking, hypertension, and diabetes on the effect of the  TNFSF4  genotype in the SAHLSIS and CASTRO samples. Hypertension was defined as p harm a co logical treatment for hypertension, systolic blood pressure  ${\geq}160\ \mathrm{mmHg}$  , and/or diastolic blood pressure    ${\ge}90\ \mathrm{mmHg}$  . Diabetes was defined by dietary or p harm a co logical treatment (SAHLSIS), self-reported disease (CASTRO), or fasting plasma glucose    $\geq7.0\;\mathrm{\mmol{/L}}$   or fasting blood glucose    $\geq\!6.1\ \mathrm{\mmol{/L}}$  . Among cases in the SAHLSIS sample, measurements performed at 3-month follow-up were used to define hypertension and diabetes. BMI was calculated as   $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  , and among cases, weights and heights measured in the acute stage were used. Study was included as a factor in the multivariable analysis of the combined SAHLSIS and CASTRO cohort. Skewed values were logtransformed before analysis. Values from continuous variables are expressed as mean  $\pm\mathrm{SE}$  . A two-sided  $p{<}0.05$  was considered significant. All analyses were carried out using Statistica version 7.  

# Results  

TNFSF4 is expressed in human atherosclerosis  

The BiKE cohort of patients subjected to surgical removal of a carotid artery stenosis was investigated for TNFSF4 expression. Cohort characteristics are outlined in Table  1 .

TNFSF4 mRNA was expressed at significantly higher levels in carotid lesions compared with healthy control arteries as measured using TaqMan PCR (Fig.  1 ) and Affymetrix GeneChip® Arrays (  $18{\pm}0.9$   vs   $12\!\pm\!0.5$   arbitrary units,  $p{=}0.028)$  ). There was no difference in mRNA levels between men and women (data not shown). Immunofluorescence examination of at hero sclerotic lesions showed that TNFSF4 was expressed in most of the macrophages and also in a minor proportion of the smooth muscle and endo the li al cells (Fig.  2 a – f). In normal arteries, TNFSF4 staining was seen only in occasional cells in the adventitia (Fig.  2 g).  

# TNFSF4 is induced by TNF $_{\alpha}$  

TNFSF4 on endo the li al cells (ECs) is known to influence T cell adhesion [ 20 ]. In light of this, we wanted to investigate whether pro-inflammatory mediators present in atherosclerosis affect TNFSF4 expression on endo the li al cells. In cultured HUVEC, TNFSF4 was induced by TNF $_{\alpha}$  . The initial response after   $^\textrm{\scriptsize6h}$   of incubation was strong, with a more than three-fold induction of TNFSF4 mRNA, which remained elevated after prolonged TNF $\alpha$   exposure (Fig.  3 ). Six hours of incubation with LPS had no statistically significant effect on TNFSF4 mRNA levels in HUVEC (data not shown), in cultured normal human arteries (un stimulated   $1.6{\pm}0.5$   vs LPS stimulated   $15\pm14$

# The rs3850641 SNP in  TNFSF4  does not influence TNFSF4 expression in at hero sclerotic lesions  

To investigate whether the minor allele of rs3850641 in TNFSF4 , which has been associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction in women [ 11 ], influenced the level of TNFSF4 in at hero sclerotic lesions, we genotyped DNA and investigated the TNFSF4 mRNA levels in carotid end art erect o mies from 130 patients belonging to the BiKE cohort, i.e., all patients in the sample for which both the mRNA level and genotype were available. There was no detectable allele-specific difference in TNFSF4 mRNA level in the lesions, neither among women nor in men only or in the entire group (Fig.  4 a – c). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant genotype-specific associations with the levels of systemic factors known to be associated with atherosclerosis, such as total white blood cell count, gly cosy late d hemoglobin (HbA1c), or serum concentrations of high-sensitivity CRP, cholesterol, and triglycerides

 (Table  2 ). We could not detect TNFSF4 in human serum

 (data not shown).  

We genotyped 239 patients who had undergone carotid end art erect o my due to symptomatic carotid stenosis and 138 sex- and age-matched control subjects for SNP rs3850641 in  TNFSF4 . The allele frequencies are presented in Table  3 . Subjects were divided in two groups: carriers and non-carriers of the minor allele. There was no genotype association with the need for carotid end art erect o my. The odds ratio (OR) for carriers of the minor allele was 0.73 (confidence interval (CI) 0.44 – 1.2,    $p{=}0.23)$  . Subgroup analysis according to sex failed to show any significant difference in risk (OR 0.75, CI 0.41 – 1.4,    $p{=}0.36$   among men and OR 0.70, CI 0.27 – 1.8,    $p{=}0.46$   among women; Table  3 ).  

# The rs3850641 SNP in TNFSF4 does not affect the risk for stroke  

To investigate the effect of the minor allele of rs3850641 on the risk for ischemic stroke, we examined two Swedish cohorts, the SAHLSIS case – control study [ 16 ] and the prospective CASTRO cohort [ 17 ]. Genotyping was successful for 597 cases and 597 controls in the SAHLSIS cohort, and these individuals were included in the analysis.

There was no significant difference in the risk for stroke between the 1,194 carriers and non-carriers of the minor allele (OR 0.93, CI 0.73 – 1.2,  $p{=}0.57$  ; Table  3 ). Subgroup analysis did not uncover any significant effects of the allele among the 767 men (OR 0.91, CI 0.67 – 1.2,  $p{=}0.57)$  ) or 427 women (OR 0.96, CI 0.64 – 1.5,  $p{=}0.86$  ; Table  3 ). BMI, smoking, hypertension, hyper lipid emi a, and diabetes were analyzed as potential con founders, and inclusion of these variables into a multivariable analysis affected the results only marginally (data not shown).  

In the CASTRO cohort, 327 cases of ischemic stroke remained after exclusion of 64 patients suffering hemorrhagic stroke and two patients due to failed genotyping. Seven hundred seventy-nine controls remained after exclusion of three cases of failed genotyping. The minor allele did not confer any significant change of risk for ischemic stroke (Table  3 ). The OR for the minor allele in the entire sample of 1,106 individuals was 0.83 (CI 0.61 – 1.1,    $p{=}$  0.23), for the 641 men, 0.84 (CI 0.56 – 1.3,  $p{=}0.40)$  , and for the 465 women, 0.82 (CI 0.51 – 1.3,    $p\!=\!0.40)$  ). BMI, smoking, hypertension, serum cholesterol levels, and diabetes were analyzed as potential con founders, and inclusion of these variables into a multivariable analysis affected the results only negligibly (data not shown).  

Finally, we pooled the patients and controls from SAHLSIS and CASTRO and analyzed the risk for stroke conferred by the minor allele of rs3850641. For the entire sample of 2,300 individuals (after exclusion of cases of hemorrhagic stroke and failed genotyping), OR was 0.89

 (C  $\mathrm{~\pi~}0.73\substack{-1.1}$  ,  $p{=}0.23)$  ), for the 1,408 men, 0.89 (CI 0.69 –

 1.1,  $p{=}0.33$  ), and for 892 women, 0.90 (CI 0.66 – 1.2,    $p{=}$  0.50). BMI, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes were analyzed as potential con founders, and inclusion of these variables into a multivariable analysis affected the results only negligibly (data not shown).

minor allele of the  TNFSF4  SNP rs3850641 has been associated with MI. We now show that, although TNFSF4 is expressed in at hero sclerotic lesions, the rs3850641 SNP is not associated with the risk for ischemic stroke or with known risk factors for at hero thrombosis.  

TNFSF4 is found on many cell types [ 21 ], activates T cells when bound to its receptor TNFRSF4, induces chemokine production [ 22 ], and mediates T cell adhesion to EC [ 20 ]. Since these effects have been associated with the development of atherosclerosis [ 23 ], it is plausible that TNFSF4 could influence lesion development and stability.  

The identification of TNFSF4 on macrophages, i.e., an antigen-presenting cell, suggests that T cell co-stimulation through TNFRSF4 – TNFSF4 interactions takes place in the at hero sclerotic lesion. Interestingly, we found occasional  $\mathrm{TNFSF4^{+}}$    endo the li al cells in the vasa vasorum of at hero sclerotic lesions. Such expression could trigger chemokine expression through interactions between T cells and EC and contribute to T cell adhesion and recruitment to lesions.  

It is conceivable that an altered function of TNFSF4 would influence atherosclerosis. A detailed screening of the

TNFSF4 genomic region identified the rs3850641 SNP as suitable for further functional studies. These data are presented in a recently submitted paper by Ria et al. Since the rs3850641 SNP, the minor allele of which increases the risk for MI in women, is located in an intron [ 11 ], it is not expected to change the functional properties of the TNFSF4 protein. Rather, it could be associated with transcription, for instance, by altering the properties of an enhancer region or as a marker for a functional polymorphism. We were, however, unable to demonstrate any allele-specific differences in the levels of TNFSF4 mRNA in at hero sclerotic lesions in the 130 patients belonging to the BiKE sample, which argues for a systemic rather than a local effect of the genotype. Importantly, the investigated human atherosclerotic lesions are complex tissues and he t erogenous in terms of cellular composition. Although no allele-specific effects on gene expression were found in this material, such effects on specific subsets of cells cannot be excluded.  

Activation of other TNF superfamily members, e.g., LIGHT and one of its receptors, the lymph o toxin    $\upbeta$   receptor  $(\mathrm{LT}\beta\mathrm{R})$  , and of TNF $\alpha$   and its receptor, influence systemic lipid homeostasis [ 8 ,  24 ]. The receptors for LIGHT and TNFSF4,   $\mathrm{LT}\beta\,\mathrm{R}$   and TNFRSF4, respectively, signal through interactions with TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs) and partly share intracellular pathways through TRAF2 and TRAF3 [ 25 ]. Based on this knowledge, we were inclined to investigate generalized effects of TNFSF4 on systemic inflammation and lipoprotein profiles and the potential influence of the rs3850641 genotype on such parameters. However, we could not demonstrate any statistically significant association between  TNFSF4  genotype and systemic parameters in this study.  

We also investigated whether the  TNFSF4  gene polymorphism affects the risk for ischemic stroke, which is often triggered by lesions in the carotid artery. However, no statistically significant associations were found between increased risk for carotid artery disease or stroke and the minor alleles of the  TNFSF4  SNPs rs3850641. Importantly, the sample size of this study does not allow for the detection of small genetic contributions to risk. With the present study design, sample sizes, and allele frequencies, we could confidently detect an OR for stroke events of  ${\geq}1.25$   for the entire group,  ${\geq}1.32\,$   for men, and  ${\geq}1.42$   for women as determined by the on-line Genetic Power Calculator provided by Purcell and Sham [ 26 ]. The interpretation of the effects of the rs3850641 in the combined cohorts is limited by the different designs of the CASTRO and SAHLSIS studies, although this was taken into account in the statistical analysis. Allele frequencies also differ between the two cohorts, which may be a reflection of the prospective vs case – control designs and different geographical distributions on the north – south axis of the studied populations. In light of this, we cannot rule out that the presence of the minor TNFSF4  allele in these populations is associated with a modest influence on the risk for ischemic stroke.  

Wang et al. [ 11 ] reported a 5.9 times increased risk for MI in female carriers of the minor rs3850641 allele. In contrast, the present study failed to detect any increased risk for stroke among carriers, female or male. Obviously, MI and ischemic stroke are different diseases, but they share many common features in terms of the developing at hero sclerotic lesion [ 3 ,  27 ]. However, ischemic stroke is, to a large extent, precipitated by emboli from a ruptured at hero sclerotic lesion in a medium size artery, whereas MI frequently arises as the result of an occluding thrombus at the site of a ruptured at hero sclerotic lesion. Furthermore, ulceration s and plaque hemorrhage are common in the carotid but rare in the coronary arteries, possibly due at least partly to the different flow rates [ 27 ]. The response after angioplasty also differs between the two vascular beds [ 28 ]. In view of this, a local or systemic effect of the TNFSF4 genotype might affect carotid and cerebral arteries and other potential path o genetic sites for ischemic stroke differently compared with coronary arteries. Because of the more diverse pathogen es is behind ischemic stroke than MI, it is also conceivable that the cohorts included in this study are more heterogeneous in terms of disease pathogen es is than the cohorts investigated by Wang et al. Therefore, effects of the  TNFSF4  genotype on certain subgroups of ischemic stroke cannot be excluded.  

In conclusion, the present investigation demonstrates that TNFSF4 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells in human at hero sclerotic lesions, but provides no evidence for an association of  TNFSF4  gene variation with the risk for ischemic stroke.
