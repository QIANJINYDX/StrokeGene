The gene encoding RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10(ARHGEF10) has been  reported to be a risk factor for a the roth rom bot ic stroke (AS) in Japanese. The singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4376531 in intron 16 on ARHGEF10 is associated  with AS and may play a role in the disease pathology. In order to explore the nature of  this association in greater detail and in a new ethnic group, we carried out a case-control  study to determine whether the rs4376531 polymorphism in ARHGEF10 is a risk factor  of AS in Han Chinese people. This study was carried out to assay the frequency of  genotypes and alleles of SNP rs4376531 in ARHGEF10 in patients with ischemic stroke  and healthy controls using the polymerase chain reaction and the restriction fragment  length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. A total of 383 individuals with AS in West  China Hospital and 214 unrelated healthy controls were recruited. The frequencies of the  G allele and GG genotype of the rs4376531 polymorphism were higher in the patients  with AS than in control individuals: frequency of G,   $91.0\%~V S~83.4\%$  ,   $P{<}0.001$  ; GG,   $82.2\%\,\nu s\,67.8\%$  ,  ${\ensuremath{P}}{<}0.001$  . After adjusting for sex, age, and multiple cardiovascular risk  factors, the homozygous GG genotype for this variant was associated with a higher risk of  AS, with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.99 (  $95\%$   CI, 2.55–7.81,  $P<0.001$  ). Our findings  suggest that the rs4376531 polymorphism in the ARHGEF10 gene is a risk factor for  AS in the Han Chinese population.

# Introduction  

Stroke among the elderly population has become a  leading cause of mortality and morbidity.  Stroke is not  only associated with high incidence and fatality rate,  but is also associated with enormous economic burden,  especially in developing countries like China.  The high  risk of stroke in people with conventional risk factors  such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dys lipid emi a,  and unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and excessive  drinking has been well established. In addition, the role of  genetic factors has also been established.  To date, many  candidate genes have been studied for a potential role in  stroke, particularly ischemic stroke, including  STRK1,  PDE4D,  ALOX5AP,  AGTRL1,  MTHFR,  NINJ2, and  ARHGEF10 .  However, the findings are inconclusive  about the association of these candidate genes with the  risk of stroke. Thus, there is a need for further studies in  regard to genes contribution to the risk of stroke.  

ARHGEF  is a member of the Rho-specific guanine  nucleotide exchange factor family, widely expressed  in the human.  It can activate RhoA by enhancing the  activity of RhoGTPases, and the effector of RhoA-Rhokinase plays a major role in the process of at hero sclerotic  cerebral infarction.  Two studies have linked mutations  in the  ARHGEF  gene family with diabetes mellitus.   In addition, a recent study found that a newly functional  single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4376531 (  $\scriptstyle{G>C}$    transition) located in intron 16 of the  ARHGEF10  may be  related to the risk of a the roth rom bot ic stroke (AS) in the  Japanese population.  To date, genetic studies on the  association between the  ARHGEF10  gene and AS have  not been published for other populations. We carried  out a case-control study in a Han Chinese population  to determine whether the allele frequencies of this SNP  are significantly different between patients with AS and  healthy controls.  

# Material and Methods  

# Subjects  

The study period was between April and November  2009 and both the patients with ischemic stroke and  case-controls were recruited from among inpatients of  West China Hospital, Sichuan University, located in  Sichuan province. This study was approved by the ethics  committee of Sichuan University and written informed  consent was obtained from all participants. Diagnosis of  AS was established in all the patients by a physician-based  clinical evaluation and investigations such as computed  tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MRI), cerebral  angiography, and carotid ultra sonography. Patients  with hemorrhagic cerebral infarction, sub ara ch noid  hemorrhage, cerebral vascular malformation, moyamoya  disease, and aneurysm rupture were excluded. Patients  with car dio embolism and stroke of undetermined  etiology were also excluded.  These patients were  excluded owing to the low genetic effects and less  proportions in the number as indicated in the study from  Japan.  The control participants were confirmed to have  no stroke by clinical examination and reported no history  of stroke or other neurological disease; all controls came  from the southwest of China.  

Data on cardiovascular risk factors were in all the  patients. Hypertension was defined as the use of  anti hypertensive medication, a systolic blood pressure   ${\geq}140\;\mathrm{mmHg},$   or a diastolic blood pressure  ${\geq}90~\mathrm{mmHg}$  .  Diabetes mellitus was self-reported or defined as the use  of medication and/or a fasting blood glucose level   ${>}7$    mmol/L. Hypercholesterolemia was diagnosed when  participants told us that they have had a history of high  total cholesterol level. History of smoking and alcohol  drinking were also self-reported.  

# Genotyping of rs4376531  

Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood  leukocytes using a standard phenol-chloroform  method. The polymerase chain reaction restriction  fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)  technique was used to assay the genotypes of the  SNP rs4376531. A 298-bp fragment of the rs4376531  polymorphism was amplified by the following primer  pair: R, 5'AT CCA CAC GG GAA CAT T TACA G 3'; F,  5'GAG GC AAA GTC A GAGA GG GTA AT 3'. Reactions  were set up in 96-well plates and amplified using  the following program in an applied biosystems PCR  thermo cycle r: an initial de natura tion at   $94^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$   for 5  min, followed by 34 cycles of de natura tion at   $94^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$    for  $30\;\mathrm{s},$  , annealing at  $56^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\;\mathrm{s},$  , and extension at   $72^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30~\mathrm{s}$  . A final extension step was performed  at  $72^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{C}$   for   $5~\mathrm{min}$  . The PCR products were digested  with restriction end on ucl ease BtscI (New England  Biolabs, Beijing, China) at  $37^{\mathrm{o}}C$   overnight. Digestion  products were separated on   $3\,\%$   agarose gels and  stained with ethidium bromide. When results  were ambiguous, the amplification and digestion  were repeated. In the end, definitive results were  obtained for all patient and control samples. To  validate the genotyping results for the rs4376531  polymorphism, PCR product of each genotype of  sample was selected for direct sequencing using an  automated sequencer (ABI Prism3730, Invitrogen  Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). The samples to be  sequenced were selected by an investigator different  from the one who performed the initial genotyping  reaction.  

# Statistical analysis  

SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used to  analyze the data in this study. Values for ordinal  variables were represented by the mean  $\pm$   standard  deviation (SD), and categorical variables were  expressed as percentages. The Student’s t-test  was used to compare values for ordinal variables  between case and control subjects, while categorical  variables were compared using the chi-square test.  The deviation of the allele from Hardy–Weinberg  equilibrium and differences in the genotype and  allele frequencies between the ischemic stoke  patients and the control individuals were also  evaluated with the chi-square test. The latent  impacts of sex, age, and classic cardiovascular risk  factors on the relatives of ischemic stroke with  SNP rs4376531 were determined using multiple  logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with   $95\,\%$   confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to  estimate the risk of ischemic stroke in the presence  of the rs4376531 polymorphism. Given the casecontrol design, the threshold for a significant   $P$   value was set at 0.05 (two-sided).  

# Results  

A total of 383 patients with ischemic stroke and 214  healthy controls were recruited. The power is 0.99  for this sample size to derive the allele G of this SNP  association with the ischemic disease. The comparison of  clinical data between patients and controls is presented  in [Table 1]. The mean age   $(\pm\mathrm{SD})$   was   $62.94{\pm}13.43\$   for  patients and  $51.76{\pm}9.93\$   for control subjects   $(P{<}0.001)$  .  The gender distribution was similar for both the patient  group   $(59.3\,\%$   men) and control group   $58.2\%$   men)  (  $P{=}0.802)$  ). As expected, the conventional risk factors  for cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension,  coronary heart disease and diabetes, were present  at higher frequencies in the patient group, but  hypercholesterolemia and smoking were not different  between patients and controls (  $P{=}0.230$   and   $\scriptstyle P=0.372,$  ,  respectively).  

We analyzed the frequency of the SNP variant with a   $\mathrm{G}{>}\mathrm{C}$   transition (rs4376531) in the patients with AS and  controls. There is a BtscI restriction site in the G allele of  the rs4376531 polymorphism, whereas there is no such  site in the wild-type C allele. Genotype distributions  for the rs4376531 polymorphism were in accordance  with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium   $(\mathrm{P=}0.189{>}0.05$   and   $P{=}0.068{>}0.05$   in patient-cohort and control-cohort,  respectively). The differences in genotype and allele  frequencies between patients with AS and control  individuals is shown in [Table 2]. The frequency of   the  homozygous genotype (GG) was higher in the patients   $(82.2\%)$   than in the controls   $(67.8\%)$     $[P{<}0.001]$  , OR 2.20,   $95\%$   CI 1.50–3.25], while the heterozygous genotype of  GC was higher in the controls  $[P{<}0.001]$  . After adjusting  for sex, age, and multiple cardiovascular risk factors,  the GG genotype was associated with a significantly  higher risk of ischemic stroke (adjusted OR 4.99,  $95\%$   CI  2.80–8.88,  $P{<}0.001$  ) [Table 3].  

# Discussion  

Our data suggest that the homozygous genotype (GG)  for the rs4376531 SNP in intron 16 of  ARHGEF10  is a risk  factor for AS in a southeastern Han Chinese population,  and this may be a dominant hereditary model, which  adds to the known association reported in Japanese. Interestingly, the allele and genotype frequencies were  different from those reported in the Japanese study,  however, similar to the data of the HapMap in the  Han Chinese in Beijing.  An explanation may be that  the allele and genotype frequencies differ for different  ethnic populations, and the different experimental  method may also be responsible for this. Genotyping  studies in other populations are needed in order to  address this question. We speculate that the rs4376531

SNP of  ARHGEF10,  which was determined through  fine mapping, may be specific to Asian populations.  This hypothesis should be tested in studies in other  parts of Asia.  

ARHGEF10 is a member of the subfamily of guanine  nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs); the N-terminal  region contains tandem Dbl homology (DH)  and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and the  C-terminal region contains putative trans membrane  domains.  The DH domain is a catalytic domain,  while the PH domain helps to modulate protein  conformation and subcellular localization, both of  which enhance the exchange of GTP with GDP on  the target Rho GTPase.  The function of ARHGEF10  remains largely unknown except for its association  with slowed nerve conduction in peripheral nerves.  It  is known that ARHGEF10 can activate RhoA, and  many studies have examined the function of the  RhoA/Rho-Kinase, for instance in vascular smooth  muscle cell (VSMC) contraction, actin cytoskeleton  organization, cell adhesion, cell motility, and  cytokinesis.  Moreover, Rho-kinase can accelerate  inflammation/oxidative stress, thrombus formation,  and fibrosis, and it can reduce endo the li al nitric oxide  synthase. All of these processes are involved in   arteriosclerosis.  

It is possible to propose a direct link between the  rs4376531 SNP in the  ARHGEF10  and arteriosclerosis.   Matsushita  et al.  used functional assays to verify that  ARHGEF10 can activate RhoA and found that the  susceptible allele G of the SNP rs4376531 may affect the  binding affinity of the Sp1 transcriptional factor, which  in turn may increase transcription of the ARHGEF10  gene, leading to high expression of RhoA.  In this  way, allele G of the SNP rs4376531 may activate the  Rho/Rho-kinase pathway in the pathogen es is of  arteriosclerosis. This suggests that it may be possible  to treat AS patients with the homozygous genotype  GG for this polymorphism in  ARHGEF10  by using an  inhibitor of Rho-activated kinase such as fasudil or  Y27632.  

Some limitations in this study must be mentioned.  First, the small sample size and hospital-based  study design mean that our population may not be  representative of the overall population in mainland  China. Secondly, in the control cohort, all the  participants are the healthy candidates for the routine  physical examination every year, so some individuals  with hypertension, even CHD were recruited. This  maybe affect the results, and if this effect was excluded  consideration of some same pathology between CHD  and AS, the difference between the AS and control  group maybe more obvious. In addition, the two  groups were not well matched by age, and there may  be a bias although we corrected it by statistics. Lastly,  our study was limited to AS-related stroke and did  not include other subtypes of ischemic stroke. Further  research examining the association of the rs4376531  polymorphism in  ARHGEF10  with other subtypes of  ischemic stroke is needed.  

The association of this polymorphism in  ARHFEG10   with AS may allow for more effective prevention of  the disease, since genetic identification of susceptible  individuals may allow them to modify the lifestyle  behaviors that place them at higher risk.
