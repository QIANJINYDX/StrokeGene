Aim:  To investigate the association of polymorphisms in four critical genes implicated in the NO-forming pathway with ischemic stroke  (IS) in a Chinese Han population.  

Methods:   DNA samples of 558 IS patients and 557 healthy controls from Chinese Han population were genotyped using the Taqman TM 7900HT Sequence Detection System.  Six SNPs (rs841, rs1049255, rs2297518, rs1799983, rs2020744, rs4673) of the 4 related  genes (eNOS, iNOS, GCH1, and CYBA) in the NO forming pathway were analyzed using the SPSS 13.0 software package for Windows. Results:  One SNP located in the intron of GCH1 (rs841) was associated with IS independent of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors in co-dominant and dominant models (  $P{=}0.003$  ,   $q{=}0.027$  ;  $P{=}0.00006$  ,  $q{=}0.0108$  ; respectively).  Moreover, the combination of  rs1049255  $\mathsf{C C}\!+\!\mathsf{C T}$   and rs841  $\mathsf{G A}\!+\!\mathsf{A A}$   genotypes was associated with significantly higher risk for IS after adjustments (  $\mathsf{O R}\!\!=\!\!1.73$  ,   $95\%$  CI: 1.27–2.35,  ${\cal P}{<}0.000\perp$  ,  $q{<}0.0001.$  ).  

Conclusion:   The data suggest that genetic variants within the NO-forming pathway alter susceptibility to IS in Chinese Han population.  Replication of the present results in other independent cohorts is warranted.

# Introduction  

Ischemic stroke (IS), known to be a multi factorial disorder, is  the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause  of death in China .  IS usually results from hypertension, athero sclerosis, diabetes, smoking, vasculitis or other etiologies.  Beyond the conventional risk factors, evidence is accumulating  that genetic factors may also contribute to the risk of stroke  development .  

Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized by the enzyme nitric oxide  synthase (NOS) from  L -arginine and oxygen in endo the li al  cells, neurons, glia and macrophages .  NO plays an important role in the control of cerebral blood flow, thr ombo genesis,  and the modulation of neuronal activity .  High concentrations of NO originating from cerebral ischemia mediate  inflammatory and cytotoxic pathways leading to neuronal  death .  NO is also important to protect vessels against athero sclerosis .  NO bio availability is tightly regulated by a balance between its production and detoxification or degradation,  and therefore, cerebral ischemia could be related to abnormalities in the expression and activity of NOS.  

Several potential functional polymorphisms in the nitric  oxide-forming pathway have recently been discovered, including (1) Leu608Ser (rs2297518) in inducible   $[i N O S]^{[7]},$  , (2, 3) Glu298Asp (rs1799983) and T-786C (rs2070744) in the promoter  region of endo the li al   $[e N O S]^{[8-12]},$   (4, 5) Tyr72His (rs4673) and   $C{+}640\mathrm{T}$   (rs1049255) in the   $3^{\prime}$  -untranslated region (UTR) of the  cytochrome b-245, alpha polypeptide gene ( CYBA ) , which  encodes the p22 phox  subunit of the NADPH oxidase, and (6)   $_{\mathrm{G+243A}}$   (rs841) in the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of the GTP cy clo hydro las e 1  gene   $(G C H I)^{[17]}$  .  With special attention to the biological process of cerebral ischemia regulation, we investigated whether  polymorphisms in these genes implicated in the pathway of  NO formation are associated with IS in a large cohort in the  Chinese Han population.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study population and data collection  

This was a multi center, collaborative study for assessment of  risk factors for stroke sponsored by the Ministry of Science  and Technology of China.  The study protocol was approved  by the review board of Tongji Medical College at Huazhong  University of Science and Technology and the ethics committees at all participating hospitals.  An informed consent form  was obtained from all participants.  

A total of 558 IS patients were recruited between November  2004 and June 2006 from five hospitals in Wuhan, China.  Only  2 subtypes of stroke — cerebral thrombosis (a the roth r ombosis) and lacunar infarction (lacunar) —were included.  Subjects  with sub ara ch noid hemorrhage, embolic brain infarction, brain  tumors and cerebro vascular malformation were excluded from  the study, as were those with severe systemic diseases such as  pulmonary fibrosis, endocrine and metabolic disease (except  diabetes mellitus), severe inflammatory diseases, autoimmune  disease, tumors and serious chronic diseases ( eg , hepatic cirrhosis and renal failure).  Subjects with card i oem boli c stroke  and documented atrial fibrillation were also excluded from our  study.  Stroke diagnosis was based on the results of neurological examination and CT or MRI according to the International  Classification of Diseases, ninth edition.  Five hundred fiftyseven ethnically and geographically matched controls were  randomly selected either from normal individuals of nearby  community-based residents   $(89.6\%)$   or inpatients   $(10.4\%)$   with  minor illnesses.  All control subjects were free of neurological  diseases following the same exclusion criteria as cases.  They  were also asked for a detailed medical history and received a  physical examination of neurological systems, including an  evaluation of body mass index.  

# DNA isolation and genotyping  

DNA was extracted from leukocytes as previously described .  All samples were genotyped using the Taqman TM  7900HT  Sequence Detection System according to the manufacturer’s  instructions.  Each assay was conducted using   $10\ \mathrm{ng}$   DNA  in a   $5~\upmu\mathrm{L}$   reaction consisting of TaqMan TM  universal PCR  master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), forward and reverse primers and FAM and VIC labeled probes  designed by Applied Biosystems [ABI Assays-on-Demand  (rs841, C_9866639_10; rs1049255, C_7516913_10; rs2297518,  C_11889257_10; rs1799983, C_3219460_20; rs4673, C_2038_20)  and Assays-on-Design (rs2070744)].  Allelic discrimination  was measured automatically using the Sequence Detection  Systems 2.1 software (autocaller confidence level  $95\%$  ).  A total  of  $10\%$   of all genotypes were repeated in independent PCRs to  check for consistency and to ensure intraplate and interplate  genotype quality control.  No genotyping discrepancies were  detected between the repeated samples.  In addition, all the  DNA samples for cases and controls were run in the same  batches.  

# Statistical analysis  

Statistical analysis were performed with the SPSS 13.0 software  package for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).  The normality of quantitative variable distribution was assessed using  the 1-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and a transformation  was applied to non-normal variables when necessary.  Summary statistics were expressed as the mean±standard error or  as percentages.  The   $\chi^{2}$  test was used to assess the deviation  from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for genotype frequencies in  both cases and controls.  Continuous variables were compared  between cases of stroke and controls using Student’s   $t.$  -test.  Frequencies of categorical variables were compared by   $\chi^{2}$  test  or Fisher’s exact test.  The potential independent role of each  single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on stroke was investigated with multiple unconditional logistic regression analysis  adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking status.  To minimize  the false positive results generated from the multiple statistical  tests used in our analysis, we adopted a method proposed by  Story and Tibshirani to estimate the FDR (false discovery rate)- based  $q$   value using QVALUE software (setting [lambda]  $\scriptstyle=0,$    false discovery rate level  ${<}0.05$  ) .  All association analyses  were conducted in three genetic models: co-dominant, dominant and recessive.  Power calculations were performed using  the QUANTO software program  (Version 1.2.3).  

# Results  

# Baseline characteristics of the subjects  

Table 1 summarizes the clinical characteristics of individuals  enrolled in the study.  The mean age, gender ratio and total  cholesterol level were similar in cases and controls.  Expectedly, there were significantly higher percentages of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyper lipid emi a, and smoking in  overall IS and subtype groups versus the controls   $(P{<}0.05)$  .  Body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood  pressure were also higher in cases than controls.  Compared to  the control group, patients in both the overall IS and subtype  groups had significantly lower HDL cholesterol   $(P{<}0.05)$  .  

# Genotypes in relation to ischemic stroke and its subtypes  

Next, we assessed associations between six SNPs from four  related genes (three at two isoforms of NOS, one at GCH1,  and two at CYBA) and IS in the Chinese Han population.  All  genotype distributions were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium   $_{(P>0.05)}$  .  Table 2 lists single SNP allelic frequencies of the four genes among IS subjects   $(n{=}558)$   and control  subjects   $(n{=}557)$  ).  Muti pli cat ive-type corrections such as  Bonferroni corrections for correlated genetic factors and tests  are highly conservative.  Therefore, we present the   $q$   value, a  measure of false discovery rate expected for a given   $P$   value  in the follow-up analysis.  Notably, rs841 in the intron region  of  GCH1  demonstrated allelic frequency differences between  overall IS and lacunar stroke subjects compared with controls  (  $P{=}0.001$   and 0.002, respectively), which maintained statistical  significance after multiple comparison correction (  $q{=}0.018$   for  both) (Table 2).  

To further investigate how each of the SNP alleles interact  in conferring genetic risk for   ${\mathrm{IS}},$   we conducted a genotypic

association analysis assuming 3 common genetic models (coshowed consistent effects using both a co-dominant (without  dominant, dominant and recessive).  Interestingly, SNP rs841  adjustment for covariates,   $P{=}0.001$  ,   $q{=}0.009;$  ; after adjustment  for traditional risk factors,   $P{=}0.003\$  ,   $q{=}0.027$  ) and a dominant  model (without adjustment for covariates,  $\scriptstyle P=0.0003,$  ,   $q{=}0.0054,$  ;  after adjustment for traditional risk factors,   $P{=}0.0006$  ,   $q{=}0.0108)$  ) (Table 3).  

To test the possible effect of the IS subtypes in detecting an  association, we then re-assessed the association between rs841  and the cerebral thrombosis and lacunar infarction groups  (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).  It is of interest to note that  rs841 was significantly associated with both subtypes (nominal   $P{<}0.05,$  ).  However, none of these results pass the significance  threshold after multiple corrections.  These negative results  could be due to reduced sample size and statistical power for  subtype analysis.  

# Association of genotype combinations with ischemic stroke  

We applied the logistic regression analyses to test potential  interactions among polymorphisms within genes involved in  the NO-forming pathway that may confer IS risk and identified significant interactions between rs1049255 and rs841   $(P{<}0.001)$  ).  In comparison with the reference combination of  rs1049255   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{CC+CT}$   and rs841 GG wild type genotypes, the  combination of the rs1049255  $\scriptstyle\mathrm{CC+CT}$   genotype together with  the rs841   $\mathrm{GABA+AA}$   genotype was found to be significantly  associated with IS (  $P{=}0.002,$  ,  $q{=}0.008,$  ; Table 4).  The distribution  combinations of other genotypes did not differ from the wildtype reference in overall IS.  The combination of rs1049255   $\scriptstyle\mathrm{CC+CT}$   and   $\mathrm{rs841\delta G A+AA}$   genotypes was associated with  significantly higher risk of IS even after adjustment for sex,  age, and multiple cardiovascular risk factors (  $(\mathrm{OR}{=}1.73$  ,   $95\,\%$    CI: 1.27–2.35;   $P{<}0.0001$  ,   $q{<}0.0001)$  ) (Table 5).  Given that the  reduced sample size for IS subtypes resulted in largely insufficient power to test potential interactions, subtype analyses  were not performed.  Taken together, our data suggest an  interaction of NO-forming pathway genes in the risk of IS.  

# Discussion  

This study is to investigate the association between genetic  polymorphisms in the genes implicated in NO production and  risk for IS development in the Chinese Han population.  The  present results indicate that polymorphisms in  GCH1  (rs841)  are independently associated with an increased risk for IS.  In  contrast, we failed to detect significant independent association with the rest of SNPs even though they have been suggested to be associated with cardiovascular diseases such as  hypertension, coronary heart disease or stroke .  

Nitric oxide, produced by nitric oxide synthase, is an important bio regulatory molecule and displays diverse biological  activities.  Tetra hydro bio pt erin (BH4) is an essential cofactor  for all three NOS isoforms, and basal enzyme activity correlates with the amount of BH4 bound tightly to   $\mathrm{NOS^{[24]}}$  .  BH4  deficiency is proposed to lead to NOS uncoupling associated  with decreased NO bio availability and increased production  of superoxide radicals from the uncoupled enzymatic form .  GTP cy clo hydro las e 1 (GCH1) is the first-step and rate-limiting  enzyme for BH4 biosynthesis in its  de novo  pathway .  Experimental mouse models with alterations in systemic or vascularspecific  GCH1  expression have shown that GCH1 is a key  regulator of vascular BH4 levels  in vivo .  Low brain levels  of BH4 have been shown in the mouse model for dominantly  inherited GCH1 deficiency .  Recent evidence suggests that  one SNP (rs841), located in the   $3^{\prime}$  -UTR of the  GCH1  gene, is  also associated with reduced biopterin-dependent effects .  The  CYBA  gene, located on the long arm of chromosome 16 at  position 24, encodes human p22 phox,  which is an essential subunit for the functionality of the NADPH oxidase .  NADPH  oxidase is an important enzymatic source of oxidative stress as  well as uncoupled NOS caused by BH4 deficiency and plays a  key role in the path o physiology of several major card i ovas cular diseases, including stroke .  Previous studies have shown  the association between CYBA polymorphisms and vascular  diseases .  Our combined analysis identified  GCH1  (rs841)  and  CYBA  (rs1049255) interactions, indicating that these two  functional polymorphisms may confer risk for IS through biological interactions with each other.  Further studies might be  required to ascertain whether  CYBA  (rs1049255) affects  GCH1   expression and how such an effect might be mediated.  

To control for potential false-positive results, we took several factors into consideration and carefully designed our  study.  First, all selected candidate SNPs have substantial  functional effects that are likely involved in the development  of IS.  Second, assuming disease prevalence between   $0.5\%$   and   $1\%$  , our combined sample size can reach  ${\tt>}98\,\%$   power to detect  a susceptibility locus with a genotypic relative risk   ${>}1.65$   at  the nominal type I error rate of   ${<}0.05$   for SNPs with minor  allele frequencies  ${>}0.31$   under the dominant model.  Third, we  recruited only ethnically and geographically matched subjects  from Chinese Han cohorts.  Given the homogenous study  population, we expect population substructure to be minimal.  However, additional replication of the association signals in  other independent cohorts is warranted.  

In summary, genetic variants in the genes implicated in  NO formation could have potentially important effects on the  pathogen es is of vascular diseases, and genotyping of these  variants may provide an additional tool to predict the risk for  ischemic stroke in the Chinese Han population.
