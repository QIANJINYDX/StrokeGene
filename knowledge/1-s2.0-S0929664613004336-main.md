ALOX5AP; cerebral infarction; interaction; mutation; PDE4D; risk  

Background/Purpose:  Through a genome-wide linkage scan, an Icelandic genetic research group identiﬁed two new genes associated with ischemic stroke: the  5-lip oxygen as e activating protein  ( ALOX5AP ) gene and the  ph os ph odi est erase 4D  ( PDE4D ) gene. Because they regulate arterial in amma tion and are closely related to atherosclerosis and plaque instability, these two mutated genes have become a research hotspot. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the risk of ischemic stroke and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the  ALOX5AP  and  PDE4D  genes in a southeastern Chinese population.  

Methods:  A total of 459 patients with stroke and 462 control individuals were recruited in the study. Four ALOX5AP SNPs (SG13S32, SG13S42, SG13S89, and SG13S114), and three PDE4D SNPs (SNP83, SNP87, and SNP45) were studied. SNP genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amp li cation followed by allele-speciﬁc primer extension, with detection by matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight. Data were coded and entered in SPSS Windows (version 16.0). Odds ratios and   $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Generalized multi factor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis was applied to detect gene e gene interactions.

Results:  No statistically signiﬁcant differences were found in the SNP genotype frequencies between cases and controls for the seven SNPs studied. GMDR analysis revealed no evidence of interactions between these seven polymorphic sites and an increased stroke risk. In addition, no association between different stroke types and the control group was detected. Results showed that only the  ALOX5AP  gene, and spec i call y the rs9551963 and rs4769060 genotypes, exhibited sign i cant ly different distributions between the stroke and control groups in female participants.  

Conclusion:  No association was found between SNPs of ALOX5AP or PDE4D and the risk of overall ischemic stroke in a southeastern Chinese population. Interactions between these two genes were not risk factors for cerebral infarction. In a the roth rom bot ic and small-artery disease subtypes, none of the seven SNPs was associated with any stroke risk; however, the  $A L O X5A P$   gene might be related to ischemic stroke incidence in females.

car dio geni c strokes, but not with other stroke subtypes. However, thus far, studies relating  ALOX5AP  and  PDE4D gene polymorphisms with the risk of ischemic stroke in various populations have yielded widely variable conclusions. Most studies have focused on the ALOX5AP HapA and HapB haplotypes and stroke risk in general, with little focus on stroke subtypes or sex comparisons.  

# Introduction  

Cerebro vascular disease is a signiﬁcant cause of death and disability in the Chinese population, with the incidence of ischemic stroke accounting for   $85{-}90\%$   of all cerebrovas- cular diseases.   Ischemic stroke has multiple etiologies and a varying pathogen es is. Predisposition to ischemic stroke is inﬂuenced by various environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors. It is likely the result of the combined effect of multiple gene e gene and gene e environment interactions. Stroke prevention requires the determination of risk factors and interventions.  

Many other genes are being studied for their potential involvement in stroke risk, including  ACE ,  MTHFR ,  NOTCH3 ,  $\scriptstyle{\beta\cdot F g}$  ,  ApoE , and  CYP2C9 . However,  ALOX5AP  and  PDE4D seem to be most closely related to atherosclerosis because they are both involved in the in amma tory process.  

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the candidacy of  ALOX5AP  and  PDE4D  as stroke susceptibility genes in a large population of stroke patients and matched controls from southeastern China, using single-marker association tests and a case e control design. Prior results from Chinese e 18   populations have not yielded clear ﬁndings. Moreover, the gene testing methodology was not uniform, making comparisons difﬁcult. The key points for these association studies between the two genes and ischemic stroke depend on sample size, stroke type, control individuals, and which SNPs are tested. We aimed to determine the singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes of ALOX5AP and PDE4D that are associated with increased risks of atherothrombotic (AT) and small-artery disease (SAD) ischemic strokes in a southeastern Chinese population.  

Genetic susceptibility to ischemic stroke was ﬁrst shown in twin pedigree studies in 1992.   Jerrard-Dunne et   ${\mathsf{a l}}^{5}$  found that a family history of stroke increased the risks of large-artery atherosclerosis cerebral infarction and smallartery occlusion cerebral infarction by 2.93 and 3.15 times, respectively, in patients    ${\leq}65$   years of age. This ﬁnding suggests a genetic component to stroke risk. In amma tion also plays a key role in atherosclerosis and stroke.   Arterial stenosis and at hero sclerotic plaque instability are two causes of cerebral infarction. Genetic variations in the components of the in amma tory response have been implicated as stroke risk factors, particularly when combined with conventional pro in amma tory risk factors.  

A LOX 5 AP encodes 5-lip oxygen as e-activating protein,which activate sara chi donate 5-ly p oxygen as e,leading to leu kotri ene synthesis.   Leu kotri ene s are secreted by various in amma tory cell types that cluster at injured sites in blood vessels and have been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis.   A linkage study identiﬁed variations in ALOX5AP to be associated with susceptibility to myocardial infarction.   A subsequent study of an Icelandic population found that a four-SNP ALOX5AP haplotype (termed HapA) doubled the risk of coronary heart disease and incidence of stroke.  

# Materials and methods  

# Study populations  

This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Third Afﬁliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College (Zhejiang, China). Informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to study enrollment. The study population comprised 459 stroke patients and 462 controls who were consecutively admitted to the Department of Neurology of the Third Afﬁliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College between March 2010 and November 2012. All participants were Chinese Han in origin and were unrelated. Exclusion criteria included arteritis, infection, tumors, blood diseases, serious cardiopulmonary, liver or kidney diseases, thyroid diseases, and autoimmune diseases.  

PDE4D encodes ph os ph odi est erase 4D, which is a member of a large superfamily of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. Ph os ph odi est erase 4D degrades the second messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which are the main signal transduction molecules found in many different cell types, including in amma tory, vascular endo the li al, and smooth muscle cells.   Greta rs do ttir et  ${\mathsf{a l}}^{15}$    found that certain SNP haplotypes of PDE4D were associated with carotid and

Cerebral infarction for all patients was conﬁrmed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and was classiﬁed according to a modiﬁed version of the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classiﬁcation.   Two subtypes of cerebral infarction (i.e., AT and SAD) were included. Patients with car dio geni c cerebral embolism, cerebral infarction of unclear etiology, or a previous history of stroke were excluded. Of the 459 patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction, 276 were male and 183 female, with an average age of   $68.56\pm10.97$   years.  

The controls had no family history of stroke and were unrelated to the stroke patients. A total of 462 healthy volunteers were ascertained, including 276 males and 186 females with an average age of   $63.82\pm9.22$   years. Vascular risk factors collected from each individual included age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, total plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, and blood platelets levels. Hypertension was deﬁned as a mean of ependent measures of blood pressure of  ${\geq}140/$  90 mmHg or the use of anti hypertensive drugs. DM was diagnosed by a fasting glucose level of  $\mathrm{>}7.8\,\mathsf{m m o l/L}$   or that of  $>\!11.1$   mmol/L 2 hours after an oral glucose challenge. Cigarette smoking was deﬁned as having smoked at least one cigarette a day for more than 1 year. Alcohol consumption was deﬁned as drinking alcohol at least 12 times in the past year.   Cerebral infarction was ruled out in the control population based on the history, physical examination, and laboratory results described above.  

# Marker selection and genotyping  

For ALOX5AP, four SNPs were studied: rs9551963A/C, rs4769060A/G, rs4769874A/G, and rs10507391A/T. For PDE4D, three SNPs were studied: rs966221C/T, rs 12188950 C/ T, and rs2910829C/T ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ). Previous studies demonstrated signiﬁcant associations between these SNPs and stroke, and that mutations in these genes may increase the incidence of ischemic stroke. Additional rationale for studying these SNPs was based on each SNP’s minor allele frequency (MAF). The MAF for ALOX5AP SG13S89 (rs4769874) is 0.051, the lowest for all SNPs in the study ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/ ).  

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using 23   a modiﬁed phenol/chloroform method and puriﬁed using the UNIQ-10 kit (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). Amp li cation of the target sequences was performed in a multiplex reaction containing 5 ng of DNA,   $0.95\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of water,  $0.625~\,\upmu\mathsf{L}$   of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) buffer containing 15 mM   ${\sf M g C l}_{2}$  ,  $1~{\upmu\mathsf{L}}$   of   $2.5\ \mathsf{m W}$   deoxy-rib on u cleo side triphosphate (dNTP),   $0.325~\upmu\mathsf{L}$   of  $25\ \mathsf{m W}\,\mathsf{M g C l}_{2}$  ,  $1~{\upmu\mathsf{L}}$   of PCR primers ( Table 1 ), and  $0.5\;\mathrm{U}$   HotStar Taq (Qiagen Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). The reaction was incubated at  $94^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 15 minutes, followed by 45 cycles at   $94^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 20 seconds, at  $56^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 30 seconds, and at   $72^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 1 minute, and a ﬁnal incubation at   $72^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 3 minutes. After PCR amp li cation, remaining dNTPs were de phosphor y late d by adding   $1.53~\upmu\mathsf{L}$  of water,   $0.17~\upmu\mathsf{L}$   of SAP buffer, and 0.3 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). After incubation at   $37^{\circ}{\mathsf{C}}$   for 40 minutes, the enzyme was deactivated by incubating at  $\mathtt{85^{\circ}C}$   for 5 minutes.  

Each  SNP  gene possessed a speciﬁc genotype, with two amp li cation primers and one extension primer ( Table 1 ). The extension primers were then added to the reaction in a buffer containing   $0.755~\,\upmu\mathsf{L}$   of water,   $0.2~\upmu\mathsf{L}$   of   $10\times$   iPLEX buffer,  $0.2\;\upmu\mathsf{L}$   of termination mix,   $0.041~\upmu\mathsf{L}$   of iPLEX enzyme (Sequenom Inc.), and  $0.804~\upmu\mathsf{L}$   of   $10~\upmu\mathsf{M}$   extension primer. The single-base extension reaction consisted of an initial de natura tion at  $94^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 30 seconds, and then at   $94^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 5 seconds, followed by ﬁve cycles at   $52^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 5 seconds and at   $\mathtt{80^{\circ}C}$   for 5 seconds (a total of 40 cycles), and a ﬁnal extension at  $72^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   for 3 minutes.  

The reaction mix was desalted by adding 6 mg of a cation exchange resin (Sequenom Inc.), mixed, and re suspended in  $25\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$   of water. At the completion of the primer extension reaction, the completed reactions were spotted onto a 384- well spec tro CHIP (Sequenom Inc.) using a MassARRAY nano dispenser (Sequenom Inc.) and genotyped using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer. Genotype calling was performed in real time using the MassARRAY RT software version 3.0.0.4 and analyzed using the MassARRAY Typer software version 3.4 (Sequenom Inc.).  

# Statistical analysis  

Allele and genotype frequencies were calculated for each locus. The Hardy e Weinberg equilibrium was tested with Chi-square tests. Continuous variables were expressed as the mean  $\pm$   standard deviation (SD) and compared by an unpaired Student  t  test, unless otherwise indicated. Categorical variables were assessed by the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Biological and clinical variables were compared between the case and control groups by the Student  t  test and Chi-square test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively.  

Clinical characteristics and genotype distribution in both groups were analyzed by a univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustment for certain risk factors, including sex, hypertension, DM, smoking, drinking, and LDL-C, to assess the independent contribution of genotypes and haplotypes to stroke. The odds ratios (ORs) and   $95\%$   conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were calculated from the    $\beta$   coe f ci ents and standard errors. All statistical tests were performed with the SPSS version 16.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A two-tailed  $p$   value of    ${<}0.05$   was considered statistically signiﬁcant. GMDR analysis was applied to detect gene e gene interactions.

was observed in the distribution of age   $(p<0.001)$   between cases and controls, but not in that of sex   $(p\,=\,0.904)$  . As expected, stroke patients had a higher prevalence of risk factors for vascular diseases, including increased age, history of hypertension, and DM   $(p<0.001)$  ). Notably, differences in the presence of conventional risk factors, including smoking and alcohol intake, total plasma cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, and blood platelets, were not statistically different between cases and controls  $(p>0.05)$  .  

# Associations between ALOX5AP and PDE4D SNP genotypes and risk of overall stroke  

Genotyping results for the ALOX5AP and PDE4D SNPs for all study participants are shown in  Table 3 . Genotype distributions in the control population were consistent with the Hardy e Weinberg equilibrium. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the genotype frequencies between cases and controls were not sign i cant ly different for any of the SNPs tested.  

# GMDR analysis  

We used GMDR to determine any gene e gene interactions that might increase stroke risk. With covariable adjustments for age, hypertension, and DM, we did not ﬁnd evidence of any ALOX5AP e PDE4D interaction that might increase stroke risk in this southeastern Chinese population ( Table 4 ).  

# Stroke types and sex dependence in ethnic Chinese populations  

This study recruited only patients attributed to AT and SAD subtypes based on the TOAST class i cation. In total, 276 AT and 183 SAD subtypes were identiﬁed. Following stratiﬁ- cation by stroke type, we found that neither AT nor SAD groups exhibited a different distribution of the seven SNPs compared to the control group ( Table 5 ).  

The  ALOX5AP  gene, and spec i call y the rs9551963 and rs4769060 genotypes, exhibited sign i cant ly different distributions between the stroke and control groups in female patients following sex strat i cation ( Table 6 ;  $p<0.05$  ). The Rs9551963 C allele showed a signiﬁcant relationship with female stroke   $(p\,=\,0.000)$  ; however, no signiﬁcant relationship was detected in the rs4769060 A allele   $(p=0.721)$  ). Based on the signiﬁcant differences in genotypic distributions between groups, an association with cerebral infarction in the female group was indicated.  

# Discussion  

Stroke is a complex clinical syndrome with various genetic and clinical risk factors including, but not limited to, age, hypertension, DM, and hyper lipid emi a. Several recent studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in stroke.  ALOX5AP , a gene involved in the leukotriene synthesis pathway, and  PDE4D , involved in signal transduction by degrading cyclic adenosine

monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate, were identiﬁed through linkage analysis to confer risk of stroke in an Icelandic population.   In this study, we attempted to determine whether certain SNPs within these two genes,  ALOX5AP  and  PDE4D , were associated with an increased risk of overall stroke in a southeast Chinese population. The SNPs chosen for this study have appeared in several non-European studies of stroke risk and all have an MAF of over  $5\%$  . We also thought that there might be some measurable gene e gene interaction between  ALOX5AP  and  PDE4D  and risk of stroke, because both genes are involved in in amma tion. However, in contrast to the European studies, we found neither any association between overall stroke susceptibility and the seven SNPs studied, nor any evidence of interactions between the two genes inﬂuencing stroke risk.  

In addition to the SNPs comprising the HapA and HapB risk haplotypes identiﬁed in the European studies, other ALOX5AP SNPs have been associated with ischemic stroke in e 27   various populations. Contrasting results reporting no

e 30   association are equally abundant in the literature. Our results, like many others, show no evidence of a link between ALOX5AP SNP genotypes and risk of stroke in a southeastern Chinese population. The association between PDE4D SNPs e 35 and stroke is similarly debated in the literature. Our analysis of three PDE4D SNPs also did not yield any evidence of an association with stroke risk.  

Although the link between  ALOX5AP  gene mutations and stroke risk is still debated, the mechanism by which it may affect cerebral infarction is through its role in leu kotri ene formation. In amma tion may alter the vascular permeability, promoting cerebral atherosclerosis.  PDE4D  also mediates in amma tion by promoting the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and the in amma tory response through regulation of intracellular second messenger activity. Because both these two genes are involved in in amma tion, an interaction between  ALOX5AP  and  PDE4D  may increase stroke susceptibility by promoting atherosclerosis and/or regulating plaque stability. Although this hypothesis is attractive, our GMDR analysis did not provide any evidence supporting this relationship. This is a novel ﬁnding; we found no other reports in the literature studying the interactions between these two genes and inﬂuence of stroke risk.  

A study conducted in an East Indian population found that SNP 83 was sign i cant ly associated with these stroke subtypes, but the association with other subtypes was determined to be in sign i cant.   The Taiwan population provides preliminary evidence suggesting that the  ALOX5AP gene polymorphisms were associated with AT stroke. However, a Swedish study indicated that SNP45 had no effect on ischemic stroke, results being derived from either pooled multi center data or a meta-analysis. In addition, signiﬁcant associations were not found when evaluating patients from the three different TOAST subgroups separately.   A study in Han Chinese of eastern China showed a negative association between the ALOX5AP variants and ischemic stroke risk. In addition, no relationship between different TOAST subtypes was detected, and a sex stratiﬁ- cation analysis showed an absence of increased sex incidence.   Given these differences, additional studies attempted to determine whether the seven SNPs exhibited a relationship with alternative TOAST class i cations. Meanwhile, our study concluded that the risks associated with the  ALOX5AP  gene were sex dependent in ethnic Chinese populations. The  ALOX5AP  gene, which included rs9551963 and rs4769060 genotypes, might add to ischemic stroke incidence in females.  

Published accounts of associations between stroke risk and ALOX5AP  or  PDE4D  gene polymorphisms offer widely variable conclusions. However, it is difﬁcult to compare these studies directly, due to differences in population, race, and gene target(s). In this study, we attempted to minimize bias due to population structure by recruiting controls and patients from the same geographical region of China. Our results should be validated in a larger, multi center study.
