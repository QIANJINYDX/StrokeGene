The inflammation and coa gulo path y during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impairs the efficiency of  the current stroke treatments. Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has shown potential in recent  years to protect the brain and other organs against pathological conditions. This study aimed to  evaluate the efficiency of RIC in brain infarct size using TTC staining and lung injury reduction by  H&E staining during the hyper-inflammatory response in rats. The inflammation and coa gulo path y  were assessed by sedimentation rate, hae mato crit, systemic oxidative stress and clotting time.  Moreover, we observed changes in the cytokine profile. The results of the first part of the experiment  showed that the inflammation and lung injury are fully developed after  $\pmb{24\,\mathsf{h}}$   of intra tracheal LPS  administration. At this time, we induced focal brain ischaemia and examined the effect of RIC pre-and post-treatment. Our results showed that RIPre-C reduced the infarct size by about  $\pmb{23\%}_{i}$  , while  RIPost-C by about   $\bf{30\%}$  . The lung injury was also reduced following both treatments. Moreover, RIC  modulated systemic inflammation. The level of chemokines CINC-1, LIX and RANTES decreased after  24 h of post-ischaemic reperfusion in treated animals compared to non-treated. The RIC-mediated  decrease of inflammation was reflected in improved sedimentation rate and hematocrit, as well  as reduced systemic oxidative stress. The results of this work showed neuro protective and lung  protective effects of RIC with a decrease in inflammation response. On the basis of our results, we  assume that immuno modulation through the chemokines CINC-1,   $\mathsf{L}\mathsf{I}\mathsf{X},$   and RANTES play a role in RICmediated protection.

In 2019, stroke was the second leading cause of death and disability ­worldwide 1 . During the past 3 decades, in  absolute terms, the global stroke incidence has increased by  $70\%$  , its mortality has increased by  $43\%$   and disability due to stroke has increased by   $32\%^{1}$  . In 2019, the five leading risk factors for stroke were high systolic  blood pressure, high body-mass index, high fasting plasma glucose concentrations, ambient particulate matter  pollution and ­smoking 1 .  

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become another risk factor for stroke since 2020, with acute  ischaemic stroke being reported in  $4.6\%$   of patients with COVID $.19^{2}$  . Infected patients may develop significant  coa gulo path y, which leads to thr ombo embo li c complications like stroke, peripheral artery thrombosis, deep  vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and venous sinus ­thrombosis 3 .  His to pathological analysis of a COVID-19 positive patient´s brain after stroke revealed hypoxic neurons, significant oedema from the underlying ischaemic insult, fibrin thrombi in small vessels and fibroid necrosis of the  vascular wall without any signs of vas cula ture ­inflammation 4 . The authors suggested that the cerebro vascular  thr ombo embo li c events in these patients may be related to hyper coa gul ability and coagulation cascade activation  due to the release of inflammatory markers and ­cytokines 4 . Micro thro mbi within the vessels were more consistent  with a systemic inflammatory response-mediated mechanism, probably related to elevated serum inflammatory  markers such as D-dimer and ­fibrinogen 3 , .  

Coa gulo path y of COVID-19 affects the efficiency of the primary treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), because the effect of rt-PA depends on haemostasis factors affecting clot ­structure 5 . Wright et al. observed a complete lack of fi bri no lysis in   $57\%$   of severe COVID19 patients through high D-dimer and unsuccessful clot lysis at  $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$   by means of ­thr ombo el as to graph y 6 , . In  agreement with this, Heinz et al. found more resistance to fi bri no lysis in critically ill COVID-19 patients than  in healthy ­controls 7 , . Moreover, hae mor rha gic transformation of ischaemic stroke was observed in some ­cases 9 .  The demand for the development of new therapies to alleviate the extent of the patient’s overall disability after  a stroke is currently even more relevant.  

The widespread increase in SARS CoV-2 variants has exhibited increased trans miss i bil it y, causing more  severe disease, evasive immune properties, impaired neutralization by antibodies from vaccinated individuals  or convalescence sera, and re infection (reviewed   $\mathrm{in}^{10}$  ), and elicited different degrees in host’s response across  SARS CoV2 variants (reviewed  ${\mathrm{in}}^{11}$  ). Despite the variant, infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the antigenic  shifts to evade host immunity are highly dependent on the host characteristics that influence the selection pressure within an endemic ­setting 12 . However, from the clinical point of view, the progress from the infection to the  evolution of severe disease remains crucial regardless of the virus variant subtype. Focusing on animal models,  LPS-induced lung injury and systemic inflammation is widely used to simulate severe COVID-19 infection in  ­rodents 13 . However, the path o physiology of this disease shares similarities with numerous viral or bacterial  infections. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury such as pneumonia  and infection caused by bacteria or viruses. Activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) with LPS during ARDS  induces leukocyte recruitment to the lungs, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and consequent lung injury  induction, which shares many similarities with ARDS after SarS-CoV-2 infection. In this preliminary study, we  decided to use this model to investigate the effect of RIC in infarct size reduction during hyper-inflammation in  general. This experimental model offers a versatile platform for investigating a wide range of infections therefore  results of this study should be useful also for simulating the outcomes of other diseases characterized by hyperinflammatory response of the host ­organism 14 .  

Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) of the limbs has shown potential in recent years to protect the brain  and other organs against pathological conditions. RIC is the application of brief, nonlethal bouts of an ischaemic  challenge before (pre-conditioning), during (per-conditioning), or after (post-conditioning) severe stress in a  distant ­organ 14 . It represents a non-invasive, safe and cheap therapeutic approach, because sublethal limb ischaemia can be induced, for example, by a pressure gauge cuff, which could easily be translated into clinical practice.  Based on current knowledge, RIC signaling from the limb to a remote internal organ suggests the involvement  of a neuro-humoral pathway leading to systemic response occurring in all organs tested so ­far 15 . As reviewed   ${\mathrm{in}}^{16}$  , neuronal and humoral components involved in the signal transfer act together on three different levels.  Stimulus (first) level involves direct activation of peripheral sensory nerves and/or releasing humoral factors  which subsequently activate the second level—peripheral sensory nerves. Peripheral sensory afferent nerves  project into autonomic centers of the central nervous system and activate efferent vagal nerves. On the level of  the target organ, neuronal activation of receptors in the target organ could be accompanied by the activation of  the intrinsic nervous system of the target organ via released humoral factors and/or by the receptor-dependent  or -independent response of the specific p are nch y mal cells of the target organ. The protective effect of RIC might  be mediated via the regulation of plasma cytokines as well as changes in cell surface properties of immune cells  (e.g. Tie-2 and CCR2) indicating the important role of humoral factors in RIC ­action 17 .  

Our results showed that remote conditioning was an effective therapy for the reduction of infarct volume in  the experimental model of focal ­ischaemia 18 . The question is whether RIC could be effective during the hyperinflammatory reaction, which is an important factor for many bacterial and viral infections, COVID-19 included.  Further studies showed that RIC modulates the overall immune cell number as well as the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. A reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines after remote conditioning has been confirmed in  a model of endo to x a emi a (induced by lip o polysaccharide administration) as well as models of myocardial and  brain ­infarction 19 . Ischaemic post conditioning in the septic shock model was also shown to attenuate increases  in systemic inflammation and neutrophil ­accumulation 20 . Moreover, hind limb preconditioning was partially  protective against indirect inflammation-mediated lung ­injury 21 . This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of  RIC in the role of a preventive agent, as well as early post-stroke therapy during the hyper-inflammatory response,  which represents an increased risk factor of stroke in COVID-19 positive patients, as well as the impaired condition for treatment. For the simulation of these conditions typical for COVID-19 disease, a model of  intra tracheal   LPS administration was used. Considering the systemic ally mediated protection of RIC of the whole organism,  we also monitored the positive effect of RIC on the lung injury and systemic inflammation induced by LPS.  

# Methods  

# Experimental scheme  

In experiments adult male albino Wistar rats were used (bred at certified vivarium of Institute of Neurobiology  SAS originated from Velaz, Czech Republic, 6 mounts old, weighing  ${300}{-}330\,\mathrm{g})$  . Rats were maintained on a  $12\,\mathrm{h}$    light/dark cycle and given food and water ad libitum. Food was withdrawn one day before surgery.  

The experiment was divided in the two parts (Fig.  1 A,B). First, the model of  intra tracheal  LPS administration  was characterised (Fig.  1 A). The animals were divided into three groups: the rats of the control group received  saline solution by  intra tracheal  in still ation   $\left(\mathsf{n}\!=\!6\right)$  , while the remaining rats received LPS   $(2.5\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$   and survived for  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   (LPS24h group,  $\mathrm{n\,{=}\,6}$  ) and  $48\;\mathrm{h}$   (LPS48h group,   $\mathrm{n\!=\!\,}6$  ). In these intervals, lung injury induced by  LPS intoxication was examined. The blood was sampled after 6, 24 and   $48\;\mathrm{h}$   of LPS administration. The blood  collected before LPS administration is referred to as the control value. Cytokine profile, hae mat ology parameters  and systemic oxidative stress influenced by the hyper-inflammatory response was monitored in this experiment.

The main idea of the second part of the experiment was to examine the effect of remote conditioning on  brain and lung injury during the hyper-inflammatory response (Fig.  1 B). The rats were divided into three groups,  all of which underwent focal cerebral ischaemia  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   after the administration of LPS. The first group contains  those rats without RIC treatment (the ischaemia group,   $\mathrm{n\!=\!\,}6$  ), while the remaining rats were conditioned before  (RIPre-C group,   $\mathrm{n\!=\!\,}6$  ) and after cerebral ischaemia induction (RIPost-C group,  $\mathrm{n\!=\!\,}6$  ). The blood was sampled  at  $^{3\:\mathrm{h}}$   (R3h) and  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   after reperfusion (R24h). The blood collected before LPS administration is referred to as  the control value. The impact of RIC on the inflammatory parameters in blood was monitored at R3h and R24h.  The infarct size and lung injury was examined one day of post-ischemic reperfusion.  

# Rat models  

# LPS administration  

Severe disease phenotypes of COVID-19 were induced by single LPS exposure, which was injected directly to  the lungs by  intra tracheal  in still ation. The rats were an aes thetis ed with   $4\%$   isoflurane in the anaesthetic cage  and anaesthesia was maintained using  $1.5\%$   isoflurane during surgery. The rats were fixed supine on a platform  inclined at  $45^{\circ}$  . The bolus of   $50\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of LPS   $(2.5\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$   was aspirated with a syringe into the distal end of a cannula,  which was then introduced into the tracheal opening and the solution was injected into the lungs.  

# Remote ischaemic conditioning  

Right hind-limb ischaemia was induced by placing an elastic rubber band tourniquet on the proximal part of the  limb for  $5\;\mathrm{min}$  , followed by a 5-min period of reperfusion according to a published ­protocol 22 . The procedure  was performed under light isoflurane anaesthesia  $(0.5\%)$   in three cycles. The treatment was induced 1 h before  (remote ischaemic preconditioning—RIPre-C) and  $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$   after (remote ischaemic post conditioning—RIPost-C)  focal cerebral ischaemia induction. Non-treated rats underwent the same procedure without the tourniquet  application.  

# Transient focal ischaemia induction  

For the induction of transient focal cerebral ischaemia (stroke), right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)  was used, as described ­by 23 . Briefly, the rats were an aes thetis ed with  $4\%$   isoflurane in the anaesthetic cage, which  was maintained during surgery with   $1.5\%$   isoflurane. The operation was performed under an operating microscope. In the first step, the right common carotid artery (CCA), the right external carotid artery (ECA) and the  right internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated. The right ECA was tied by the node at the distal end permanently  and then a filament was inserted and pushed up the ICA until light resistance was felt. MCAO suture for rats   $(331{-}400\:\mathrm{g},$  , tip  $0.41\mathrm{-}0.42\:\mathrm{mm}$  ; RWD Life Science Co, Ltd. China) was inserted approximately   ${19{-}20}\,\mathrm{mm}$   from  the carotid bifurcation to effectively block the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The severity of MCA occlusion  was confirmed by measurement of local cerebral blood flow using a laser-Doppler flow meter (PeriFlux System  5000; Perimed AB, Jarfalla, Sweden; Fig.  3 ). A 407 probe with an adequate holder was situated on the skull over  the MCA (  $5\:\mathrm{mm}$   lateral and   $1\:\mathrm{mm}$   posterior to bregma). Only rats with blood flow reduced by more than  $80\%$    were used in the experiments. The duration of filament insertion was  $90\;\mathrm{{min}}$  , after which it was removed.  

Neurological deficit was assessed in each animal on a numerical scale of 0–4 after   $1\mathrm{~h~}$   and one day of postischaemic reperfusion. The scoring system based  $\mathrm{on}^{24}$   was used: (0) no detectable deficits; (1) forelimb flexion  and torso turning to the contra lateral side when lifted by the tail; (2) the same behaviour as grade 1 and decreased  resistance to a lateral push; (3) the same behaviour as grade 2 with unilateral circling; and (4) no spontaneous  walking and a depressed level of consciousness. Rats with a neurological deficit lower than grade 2 were excluded  from the study.  

# Hae mat ology tests and animal body temperature  

Temperature  

The change in body temperature of the rats was measured using the rectal thermometer (ATC1000, World  precision instruments Sarasota, FL) 6, 12 and   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   after the LPS intoxication and following 3 and  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   of postischaemic reperfusion.  

# Clotting time  

This test measures the time it takes for a clot to form in a blood sample. A non-he par in is ed capillary tube was  filled with blood. The capillary tube was broken and slowly separated in   $10\:s$   intervals, until the blood formed a  continuous thread-like clot between the broken ends of the tube. The time from capillary filling to the appearance of the clot thread is the clotting time expressed in seconds (s).  

# Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a blood test that can indicate and monitor an increase in inflammatory activity.  The sample of anti-coagulated whole blood was allowed to stand in the vertical tube for  $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$  . The red blood cells  slowly fell to the bottom due to the influence of gravity. The test result depends on the amount of plasma at the  top of the tube, measured after  $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$  . The result is reported in millimetres per hour   $(\mathrm{mm/hr})$  .  

# Hae mato crit  

A hae mato crit test measures the proportion of red blood cells in the blood. A he par in is ed capillary tube was  filled with blood and centrifuged (  $(1\bar{2},\!000\ \mathrm{rpm},10\ \mathrm{min})$  ). Hae mato crit was estimated by calculating the ratio  of the column of packed erythrocytes to the total length of the sample in the capillary tube and expressed as a  percentage of the blood cells (  $\cdot\%$   of blood cells).  

# Systemic oxidative stress  

DNA damage in circulating lymphocytes was assessed by single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) according to  Singh et al. , with minor modifications. Isolated lymphocytes were mixed with   $1\%$   low-melting-point agarose  in PBS   $\left(\mathrm{pH}\ 7.4\right)$   and added to microscope slides precoated with   $1\%$   normal-melting-point agarose in PBS (pH  7.4). The suspension was covered with a coverslip and allowed to solidify in a refrigerator for   $20\;\mathrm{min}$  . The coverslip was removed and the slides were submerged in lysis solution   $(2.5\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{NaCl}$  ,   $100~\mathrm{mM}$   Na2EDTA,   $10~\mathrm{mM}$    Tris,  $1\%$   Triton X-100 and   $10\%$   DMSO,  $\mathrm{pH}\,10_{,}$  ) for  $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$  . The slides were then placed in the electrophoresis buffer  (5 M NaOH, 200 mM Na2EDTA,  $\mathrm{pH}\,13$  ) for  $20\,\mathrm{min}$  . To assess single-strand breaks (SSBs) in lymphocyte DNA,  an alkaline   $\mathrm{pH}$   is necessary to unwind the DNA. Electrophoresis was carried out using the same solution for   $25~\mathrm{min}$   at   $25\;\mathrm{V}.$   After electrophoresis, the slides were neutral is ed with neutralisation buffer (  $.400~\mathrm{mM}$   Tris, pH  7.5,  $15\,\mathrm{{min}}$  ). The above-mentioned steps were carried out in a refrigerator  $(4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  . Slides were stained with SYBR  GOLD nucleic acid gel stain directly before being imaged under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51,  excitation at  $485\,\mathrm{nm}$  , emission at  $520\,\mathrm{nm}$  ) equipped with a camera (Olympus DP50). Comet micrographs (Olympus DP image software) were processed using the CometScore™ 1.5 image analysis system (TriTek Corp., USA).  Lymphocyte DNA damage was examined by the parameter  $\llangle\%$   DNA in tail’ (  $100\%$   of cell fluorescence intensity  minus the intensity of the   $\%$   DNA in the head). For each individual sample, two slides were prepared and cells  were randomly selected for analysis (100 cells per sample).  

# Cytokine profile  

The cytokine profile was assessed using a membrane-based sandwich immuno as say Proteome Profiler RatCytokine Array Kit (Panel A, R&D Systems). Here,  $200\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   of plasma from five rats in each group was pooled (  $(1000\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$    total volume/group). The samples were mixed with a cocktail of bio tiny late d detection antibodies and incubated  at room temperature for   $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$  . The sample/antibody mixture was added to membranes spotted with capture antibodies and incubated overnight at  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Following a wash, the strep t avid in–HRP and che mi luminescent reagent  mix was applied. The che mi luminescent signal was captured by a Fusion FX Che mi luminescent system (Vilber  Lourmat). Pixel densities from each membrane were analysed using the ImageQuant™ TL analysis software and  normalised to references spots on each membrane.  

# Infarct size  

The brain was isolated and cut into  $2\,\mathrm{mm}$   coronal slices. The 4th slice was immersed in a  $1\%$   solution of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetra zo liu m chloride in PBS and incubated   $(37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C},15{-}20\operatorname*{min})$  . After subsequent fixation in   $10\%$   formalin,  the section was scanned using a high-resolution scanner (Hewlett Packard Scanjet) and images were processed  using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) for the final infarct size calculation. The non-ischaemic hemisphere (contra lateral), ischaemic hemisphere (ips i lateral) and infarct area of each  brain section were measured in a blinded manner and the average infarct area was calculated by the formula:  (infarct area on the anterior surface  $^+$   infarct area on the posterior surface)/2. The infarct volume   $(\%)$  , corrected  to compensate for brain oedema, was calculated by applying the formula [contra lateral hemisphere volume— (ips i lateral hemisphere volume—infarct volume)]/contra lateral hemisphere volume  $\times100^{26}$  .  

# Lung injury  

# Lung oedema  

The lobe of the right lung was used to determine lung oedema by calculating the wet/dry weight ratio. The lobe  was weighed immediately after excision and then left to dry for 1 day in an incubator set at   $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   before being  weighed again. The oedema was expressed as a weight ratio of the wet and dry lung section.  

# Alveolar septa thickening  

The left lobe of the lung was used for the his to logical analysis. The tissue was fixed in formalin for 3 days, cut  into  $5\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$   thick sections and stained with hae mato xy lin and eosin (H&E).  

An investigator blinded to group settings screened and analysed 25–30 fields (  $\cdot20\,\times$   objective magnification)  covering the entire slide of each sample using ImageJ software. The percentage of tissue area (thickness of alveolar septa) per field was quantified for all screened images. The tissue (red signal) areas were set as hue (0–255),  saturation (0–255) and intensity (212–255) and the alveoli (white signal) areas were set as hue (0–255), saturation  (0–255) and intensity   $\scriptstyle(0-211)^{27}$  .  

# Results  

# Course of the LPS intoxication‑mediated changes  

In the first part of the experiment, the model of hyper-inflammation induced by LPS was characterised. We  monitored the systemic response on LPS intoxication and plasma cytokine profile changes during the hyperacute phase (  $6\,\mathrm{h}$   after the administration of LPS) and two time points of the acute stage   $(24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   and  $48\,\mathrm{h}$   after LPS  intoxication). Subsequently, after inflammation development during the acute stage, an indirect inflammationmediated lung injury was determined.  

# Systemic response on the LPS administration  

Although some of the blood parameters started to rise  $6\,\mathrm{h}$   after LPS intoxication, the complete systemic response  reflected by significant alterations of all parameters became visible at   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   (Fig.  2 ). At this time, we observed a  clotting time which was decreased by half as well as decreased hae mato crit by about  $15\%$   compared to the control  values. The initiation of inflammatory processes was reflected by a 2.5-fold increase in erythrocyte sedimentation  rate. Systemic oxidative stress related to inflammatory changes increased more than 8 times over the control  (  $5.7\pm2.2\%$   DNA in tail). The temperature of rats was not affected by LPS administration during the experiment.  

# Plasma cytokine profile after the LPS intoxication  

We used a rat cytokine array for the parallel determination of relative levels of selected cytokines and chemokines  following LPS intoxication. The hyper-acute phase   $(6\,\mathrm{h})$   of intoxication was characterised by the rose of the three  pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines CINC-1, LIX and ICAM-1 (Fig.  3 A,B). The acute stage (  $-24\,\mathrm{h}$   after LPS  administration) is characterised by elevated ICAM-1 and by the transient increase in CXCL7. On the other hand,  the drop of CINC-1, LIX and RANTES was detected at this time. The baseline value of all observed cytokines/ chemokines was reached after   $48\,\mathrm{h}$   of LPS intoxication. The level of LIX and RANTES dropped even under the  control value at this time.

Lung injury induced by the administration of LPS  

H&E staining was used to reveal his to logical changes of the lung. Typical signs for lung injury are thickening  of the alveolar septa and oedema. LPS intoxication caused an increase in alveolar septa thickness after   $24\,\mathrm{\AA}$    (Fig.  4 A,B), which was also significant during the next  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   (Fig.  4 A,B).  

We detected oedema in the lung one day after local exposure to lip o polysaccharide   $(4.8\pm0.2\,\mathrm{w/d}$   ratio), which  was subsequently reduced almost to control values during the next  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   (  $4.5\pm0.3$   w/d ratio; Control   $4.3\pm0.2$    w/d ratio) (Fig.  4 C).  

# RIC‑mediated changes in the condition of hyper‑inflammation  

The results of the first part of the experiment showed that the inflammation and lung injury induced by LPS is  fully developed at  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   after administration. At this time, we induced brain ischaemia and examined the impact  of RIC on brain and lung injury during the hyper-inflammatory response. Moreover, we investigated the modulation of inflammation by RIC during the early   $(3\,\mathrm{h})$   and delayed phases   $(24\,\mathrm{h})$   of post-ischaemic reperfusion.

Systemic response on RIC after focal ischaemia during hyper‑inflammation state  

The temperature was not affected by LPS exposure   $(38\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  . On the other hand, brain ischaemia mediated temperature increases after  $3\,\mathrm{h}$   (above  $39\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ). Surprisingly, only RIC pre-treatment abolished post-ischaemic hyperthermia (Fig.  5 A).  

RIC, regardless of the application time, improved the erythrocyte sedimentation rate by about  $50\%$   after  $_{3\,\mathrm{h}}$    of reperfusion (Ischaemia   $3.1\pm1.5~\mathrm{mm/h}$  ; RIPre-C   $1.4\pm0.4\mathrm{~mm/h}$  ; RIPost-C   $1.5\pm0.7\ \mathrm{mm/h})$   and about  $28\%$   

 (RIPre-C   $4.9\pm1.6~\mathrm{mm/h}$  ; RIPost-C   $5\pm1.3~\mathrm{mm/h})$  ) after  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   of reperfusion compared to ischaemic animals

Hae mato crit dropped by an additional   $15\%$   compared to the LPS-induced reduction at  $3\,\mathrm{h}$   following ischaemia (Control value  $62.3\pm4.1\%$   of blood cells; LPS24h   $52.7\pm5.1\%$   of blood cells; Ischaemia  $43.5\pm6.2\%$   of blood  cells) (Fig.  5 C). Hind limb treatment preserved the control values of hae mato crit after  $_{3\,\mathrm{h}}$   of reperfusion (RIPre-C   $62.9\pm4.1\%$   of blood cells; RIPost-C   $58.2\pm4\%$   of blood cells), but not after   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$  , when we detected a decrease  of about   $12\%$   in preconditioned animals (  $58\pm8.6\%$   of blood cells) and about   $19\%$   in post-conditioned animals  (  $\cdot50\pm1.7\%$   of blood cells).  

Clotting time reduced by half after  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   of LPS exposure but was not affected by brain ischaemia (Fig.  5 D).  RIC treatment transient ly improved clotting time in the early stage of post-ischaemic reperfusion; however, the  loss of its efficiency was observed after one day.  

Remote conditioning applied before as well as after the brain ischaemia caused a reduction in the systemic  oxidative stress (Fig.  5 E). The ischaemia induction caused an increase in DNA damage of peripheral lymphocytes  after  $_{3\,\mathrm{h}}$   of reperfusion   $(9\pm2.7\%$   DNA in tail) up to one day (  $.15.5\pm4.7\%$   DNA in tail). The systemic response to  ischaemia in LPS-treated animals was completely abolished in RIC-conditioned groups.  

RIC‑mediated changes in cytokine profile after cerebral ischaemia during hyper‑inflammatory response  

In this part of the experiment, we focused on cytokine/chemokine levels, which were influenced by LPS intoxication in the first instance; we observed changes induced by ischaemia induction and RIC treatment. Compared to  ischaemia, RIC treatment mediated changes in the cytokine profile, but in a time- and treatment-specific manner  (Fig.  6 A,B). As described above, the pre- or post-conditioning of transient focal brain ischemia subjected animals  results in almost identical systemic responses to treatments, showing the early (  $_{3\,\mathrm{h}}$   of reperfusion) and delayed  (  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   of reperfusion) reply. Therefore, the RIC effect on cytokine profile in this experiment was determined  based on 1) similarities in RIC-mediated changes applied as pre- and post-conditioning treatments and 2) the  time-dependent response of RIC treatment (3 and  $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   of reperfusion).  

On the basis of these specifications, we selected the chemokines CINC-1, LIX and RANTES (Fig.  6 C–E). At   $3\,\mathrm{h}$   of post-ischaemic reperfusion, the plasma levels of these hyper-acute chemokines increased transient ly. At this  time, we observed elevated levels of CINC-1 (Fig.  6 C) and LIX (Fig.  6 D) in RIC-treated animals; however, plasma  levels of RANTES dropped in post-conditioned rats (Fig.  6 E). In the acute stage of post-ischaemic reperfusion,

we observed a downward trend of relative amounts of all of them. However, the reduction following the RIC  treatment (pre- and post-) was meaningful. In summary, RIC applied before and after brain ischaemia influences  the level of chemokines predominantly during the acute phase of post-ischaemic reperfusion.  

Effect of RIC on inflammation‑mediated lung injury  

We observed a significant reduction of alveolar septa thickening in RIC-treated animals; while preconditioning  caused a reduction of about  $3.5\%$  , post conditioning caused a reduction of up to  $5\%$   (Fig.  7 A,B). We observed no  changes in lung oedema after  $24\,\mathrm{h}$   of reperfusion in animals with (RIPre-C  $4.4\pm0.6$   w/d ratio; RIPost-C  $4.6\pm0.3$    w/d ratio) or without RIC treatment (  $4.5\pm0.1$   w/d ratio) (Fig.  7 C).

We observed the neuro protective effect of the RIC, even under hyper-inflammatory reaction conditions  (Fig.  8 A,B). In preconditioned animals, we observed an infarct size reduction of about  $23\%$   (  $(36.26\pm15.99\%$   of  infarct volume) compared to non-treated ischaemic rats   $(58.77\pm3\%$   of infarct volume) (Fig.  8 A), however with  no effect on the neurological score (  $2.8\pm0.5$   neurological score) (Fig.  8 B). Remote ischaemic post conditioning  reduced the infarct area by about  $30\%$     $\phantom{0}{29.25}\pm11.19\%$   of infarct volume) (Fig.  8 A), which was also reflected in  the improved neurological score (from  $3\pm0$   to   $1.7\pm0.3\$  ) (Fig.  8 B).

# Discussion  

With the arrival of COVID-19, the severity of acute brain injury caused by stroke increased. The complications  arising in positive patients affected by stroke are caused by the presence of hyper-inflammation typical of cytokine  storm and coa gulo path y. Related to stroke treatment, the alternative strategy based on the non-invasive stimulation of endogenous neuro protection—RIC—has become the attractive supplementary therapy in several clinical  trials. However, there are still many issues to be investigated for the successful implementation of RIC in clinics,  especially related to com or bidi ties of stroke patients. In this work, we focused on the evaluation of the potential  of remote ischaemic conditioning in infarct size reduction after stroke in a state of hyper-inflammatory response  which is characteristic of many viral and bacterial infections, SARS-CoV-2 included.  

Although several identified variants of the SARS CoV-2 virus presuppose the use of subtype-specific models  in experimental research, the impossibility of infecting rat respiratory cells by SARS CoV-2 directs research  to the use of models simulating the systemic impact of infection in the form of ­hyper inflammation 28 , . To  mimic the hyper-inflammation condition in our experiment, the model of  intra tracheal  LPS intoxication was  established. The hyper-acute phase of the model of LPS intoxication was characterised by increased levels of  cytokines and chemokines in plasma, che mo attract ants of the neutrophils CINC-1 and LIX and the soluble  form of ICAM-1. Increased levels of sICAM-1 remained elevated up to the acute stage,   $24{\mathrm{~h~}}$   following the LPS  application. Increased sICAM-1 plasma level is considered a marker of lung epithelial and endo the li al injury and  is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung ­injury 30 . sICAM-1 activates macrophages  in the lungs and enhances lung ­injury 31 . Increased levels of chemokines like CINC-1 and LIX lead to neutrophil  activation and mobil is ation to the site of inflammation, which also contributes to the lung injury. Dys regulated  inflammation and intense leukocyte infiltration leads to a breakdown of the alveolar-epithelial barrier, which  results in pulmonary ­oedema 32 . The pulmonary oedema in an established model of hyper-inflammation in our  experiment was clearly visible after the first day. Although it was not the focus of our research, the H&E staining  of lung slices revealed an increase in neutrophil infiltrates in the surrounding alveolar. Consistent with Herrero  et al. , the oedema was associated with a thickening of the alveolar septa at the same time, confirming that the  time point of the development of acute lung injury had been reached.  

A response in systemic parameters reflecting acute inflammation was also developed following one day when  the meaningful changes in sedimentation rate, hae mato crit and systemic oxidative stress were recorded in presented results. Due to a close relationship between immune system activation and the ha emo static system, it is  not unexpected for LPS intoxication in this study to have significantly affected the clotting time and impaired  the process of coagulation. Based on the characteristics of the animal model used for our experiment, the acute  stage of LPS intoxication was selected for future studies of RIC neuro protective properties for stroke treatment  under the condition of hyper-inflammation.  

After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were the several studies showing the increased mortality  and poor outcome of positive patients affected by ­stroke 33 . Compared with those with mild or a symptomatic  COVID-19 at stroke onset, patients who have strokes while hospitalised with severe manifestations of COVID-19  have significantly elevated inflammatory markers and markers of ­hyper coa gul ability 34 . The study of Finck et al.   showed that the presence of systemic inflammation in stroke patients is linked with a poor outcome and death.  The hyper-inflammatory state is associated with many other viral, bacterial or autoimmune diseases, which could  influence the course, outcome and treatment of strokes.  

Remote ischaemic conditioning has been intensively studied in recent years due to its wide range of protection, not only against ischaemic injury in organs. Our previous results showed that remote conditioning was an  effective therapy in the reduction of infarct volume in the experimental model of focal ­ischaemia 18 . However, the  threshold of its efficiency for stroke treatment in connection to obesity was recently ­confirmed 36 . This highlights  the need for targeted research regarding the efficiency of experimental neuro protective strategies. Therefore,  we provide the first pre-clinical evidence of RIC outcomes in the condition of hyper-inflammation, which is  characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral or bacterial infection. Considering our previous ­results 11 , we can  speculate that the beneficial effect of RIC reflected in the reduction of infarction following the stroke is related  rather to the activation of neuro protective mechanisms in the organism than the suppression of hyper in fl ammation caused by LPS administration (although it may not be strictly excluded). In this experiment, the range of  infarction of LPC-injected animals after stroke with or without RIC application did not show noticeable changes  compared to animals without hyper-inflammatory reactions published ­previously 11 . However, this hypothesis  must be verified adequately using specified experiments.  

In the present study, we confirmed the reduction in infarct size following the pre- and post-RIC treatment  during hyper-inflammation; thus, we confirmed the effectiveness of this experimental therapy, even under the  conditions of an inflammatory storm. The range of infarction during hyper-inflammation was reduced by more  than  $20\%$   following RIC application, which is consistent with numerous animal studies of RIC efficacy in intact  conditions (summarised  ${\mathrm{in}}^{37}$  ). However, data from our analysis in LPS-treated animals confirm improvement in  neurological outcomes solely in post-conditioned individuals. Systemic administration of LPS, a potent TLR4  ligand of bacterial origin, renders animals tolerant to injury in several models of cerebral ­ischemia 38 – 41 . It suggests  that the LPS application in our experiment could serve as a preconditioning per se. In combination with remote  ischemic conditioning as a preventive intervention or post-stroke treatment, it might affect its final phenotypic  manifestation despite its neuro protective effect. In our previous ­study 42  the blood transfer of ischemia and RICtreated animals was tested for its neuro protective properties in a rat model of stroke. Although pre-treated stroke  animals by the combination of two of those independent stressors (i.e. double preconditioned) have shown the  most extensive reduction of brain infarction, no improvement of neurological deficit was indicated in those  rats one day later. Based on our experiences, improvement in neurological deficit might appear with longer  reperfusion when using Bederson’s scoring system (up to 2–3 days), thus suggesting the need to use complex  neuro behavioral tests in this type of experiment to discuss intervention-related neurological impairment in a  more precise way.  

Moreover our results have shown that the lung tissue injury initiated by inflammatory storm was also protected by RIC and the alveolar septa thickening was significantly improved by the application of RIC. The lung  oedema induced by LPS disappeared after   $48\;\mathrm{\textbar{h}}$   in treated as well as non-treated animals. The meta-analysis  provided by Kashiwagi et al.  showed the beneficial effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning on lung function in patients undergoing various surgical procedures under general anaesthesia. The lung protective effect by  RIC was also observed in several animal models of lung injury arising from different stressors (reviewed ­in 14 ).  

Modulation of the inflammatory response seems to be the key effect of RIC treatment and could be detected  at several levels. There are several studies showing the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and an  increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine levels following   $\mathrm{RIC^{44,45}}$  . In the present study, we observed the RIC  modulation of the cytokine profile, but in a time- and treatment-specific manner. This is consistent with a  previous ­study 46 , in which different expression patterns of cytokines were reported according to per- and postconditioning, suggesting the participation of different signalling pathways, but leading to a similar effect. In this  paper, we observed the comparable effect of both (RIPre-C and RIPost-C) treatments on the level of CINC-1,  LIX and RANTES. The expression of these chemokines decreased significantly during the delayed phase of  post-ischaemic reperfusion as a consequence of RIC treatment. All RIC-modulated chemokines play a role in  neutrophil activation and their mobil is ation to the site of ­inflammation 47 – 49 . Decreased levels of these chemoattractants could explain the reduced lung injury after RIC due to the modulation of leukocyte infiltration which  resulted in a lower pro-inflammatory response. However, a direct influence on the modulation of infarcted tissue  immuno reactivity should not be excluded. The decreased potential of neutrophil migration could also be reflected  in reduced systemic oxidative stress. It is well known that activated neutrophils produce reactive oxygen species  (ROS) during inflammation. Neutrophil-produced ROS play a pivotal role in many inflammatory diseases, for  example in organ dysfunction during ­sepsis 50 . Our previous results showed a significant reduction of systemic  oxidative stress after RIC application in a model of global brain ­ischaemia 51 . The present study showed comparable results, where we observed decreased DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes after RIPre-C and RIPost-C  application. The immuno modulator y effect of RIC was reflected also in an improved sedimentation rate and  hae mato crit. Although the observed inflammatory parameters were positively influenced by RIC, coagulation  was modulated only transient ly during the early stage, when we observed the clotting time in the baseline value.  Contradictory results about the coagulation process affected by RIC were also obtained in clinical trials. While  Kim et al.  observed no effect of RIC on platelet ag greg ability and coagulation, Gorog et al.  conclude that RIC  may reduce platelet reactivity.  

Although several experimental studies showed the immuno modulator y effect of RIC, reflecting on clinical  trials, the efficiency of RIC depends on the baseline and peak inflammation (reviewed  ${\mathrm{in}}^{19}$  ). Individuals with  chronic inflammatory disease and persistently low levels of inflammation at baseline may already be resistant to remote ­conditioning 19 , . In the present study, using the acute hyper-inflammation model, we observed  neuro protective as well as a lung protective effect of RIC with a decrease in the inflammation response. On  the basis of our results, we assume that immuno modulation plays a key role in RIC-mediated protection. We  observed the influence of RIC on the cytokine/chemokine profile in plasma; however, it depended on a time-and specific-manner. We suggest that the modulation of chemokines CINC-1, LIX and RANTES in a delayed  phase of post-ischaemic reperfusion represents the common pathway leading to protection mediated by remote  ischaemic pre- and post-conditioning. The immuno modulator y effect of RIC predisposes this approach to the  treatment of stroke in patients with ongoing inflammation, which is a typical sign of many bacterial, viral and  autoimmune diseases, including COVID-19.
