Summary  Objective : The exposure of tissue factor (TF) to blood ﬂow is the initial step in the coagulation process and plays an important role in thr ombo genesis. We investigated the role of genetic polymorphisms and haplotypes of the TF gene in the risk of ischemic vascular disease.  Methods : Four hundred and twenty-two Italian patients with juvenile myocardial infarction (MI) and 434 controls, 808 US cases with MI and 1005 controls, 267 Italian cases with juvenile ischemic stroke and 209 controls and 148 German cases with juvenile ischemic stroke and 191 controls were studied.  rs1361600 ,  rs3917629  (rs3354 in the US population),  rs1324214  and  rs3917639  Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped. Additionally, a meta-analysis of all previous studies on TF loci and the risk of ischemic coronary disease (ICD) was performed.  Results : After multivariable analysis none of the SNPs, major SNP haplotypes or haplotype-pairs showed any consistent association with MI. Pooled meta-analysis of six studies also suggested that TF polymorphisms are not associated with CHD. A signiﬁcant, independent association between SNP rs1324214 (C/T) and juvenile stroke was found in Italian and German populations (OR for TT homozygotes   $=\,0.47$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.24–0.92, in combined analysis). Pooled analysis also showed a signiﬁcant association for haplotype H3   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.76$  ,  $95\%$   CI 0.57–1.00) and haplotype-pair H3–H3   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.43$  ,   $95\%$   CI 0.20– 0.92).  Conclusions : TF genetic variations were associated with the risk of ischemic stroke at young age, but did not aﬀect ischemic coronary disease.  

Keywords : genetic polymorphisms, juvenile, myocardial infarction, stroke, tissue factor.  

Coagulation activation and consequent thrombus formation are key mechanisms in the etiology of ischemic arterial disease. The initial step in the coagulation process is the exposure of tissue factor (TF) to the blood ﬂow. TF is an integral membrane glycoprotein that binds coagulation factor VII and its activated form (VIIa) and leads ultimately to thrombin generation, ﬁbrin deposition and clot formation [1].  

TF plays an important role also in thr ombo genesis following at hero sclerotic plaque rupture. In particular, after plaque disruption, TF is exposed to the bloodstream, triggering thrombosis [1,2].  

TF expression can be induced in monocytes and in endo the li al cells in response to various stimuli [3,4]. TF mRNA and antigen are present in at hero sclerotic plaques from patients undergoing carotid end art erect o my [5]. Moreover, macrophages isolated from carotid at hero sclerotic plaques express a marked pro coagulant activity [6].  

Recent studies suggest that plasma soluble TF (sTF) may also contribute to thrombosis. Prospective studies have shown that high sTF levels were predictive of an unfavorable outcome [7] and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with acute coronary syndrome [8].  

Previous studies about association between TF genetics and vascular disease reported contrasting results. The    $-603\mathrm{A}/$   $-1208\mathrm{D}/\mathrm{-}1322\,\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{-}1812\mathrm{C}$   haplotype was associated with both reduced plasma TF level and lower risk of venous thrombosis but not with MI [9]. Similarly, the  $-603\mathrm{~A}/\mathrm{G}$   polymorphism was not associated with either TF antigen levels or long-term outcomes of death or re-infarction in patients with ongoing MI [10]. Other studies, however, reported an association between the    $-603\mathrm{G}/{-1208\mathrm{I}}/{-1322\mathrm{\;T}}/{-1812\mathrm{T}}$   haplotype and the risk of MI [9]. Lastly, the G allele of the intronic   $5466\mathrm{A/G}$   TF polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death [11].  

Several studies have also been performed to test the association between TF SNPs and TF mRNA and activity with contrasting results [12–15].  

However, no study has investigated the role of TF genetics in the risk of ischemic stroke. Our group have previously demonstrated that genetic variations of IL-1B were associated with the risk of both myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke at young age by affecting the release of IL-1B from stimulated mono nuclear cells and in turn the expression of TF on cell membranes [16,17]. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible contribution to MI and/or ischemic stroke of tag-haplotypes in the TF gene in four case–control studies from different populations. Finally a meta-analysis of our study and all published studies on the association between TF polymorphisms and ICD was performed.  

# Methods  

# Study populations  

Recruitment of the Italian and US MI populations has been described elsewhere [16,18,19] (see Appendix S1). Patients with ﬁrst-ever ischemic stroke   $(n\,=\,267)$  ) occurring before the age of 45 years, consecutively admitted to the Department of Neurology, University of Brescia, and control subjects   $(n\,=\,212)$  ) recruited from the general population in the area surrounding the medical centre, with no known history of vascular disease, frequency-matched to the cases by sex and age, were included in the study [20].  

Consecutive patients   $(n\,=\,148)$  ) aged less than 50 years, who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, University of Heidelberg, for ischemic stroke, and control subjects   $(n\,=\,191$  ) without a history of vascular disease randomly selected from the population registries of the same region in southwest Germany were included [21]. Patients were categorized according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment [TOAST] criteria [22]. All the studies were approved by the local Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was provided by all study participants.  

# SNPs selection and genotyping  

SNPs for genotyping were selected using the Seattle SNP database (http://pga.gs.washington.edu/) [23]. At a linkage d is equilibrium threshold of    $r^{2}\,=\,0.65$   and minor allele frequency   $(\mathrm{MAF})\geq10\%$  , four SNPs were selected:  rs1361600 , rs3917629 ,  rs1324214  and  rs3917639 . The  rs3917639  SNP was excluded from further analyses because after genotyping it turned out to be a single allele genetic marker in both Italian and US study populations. In the US sample rs3917629 was replaced by rs3354 in the same bin. In the replication German sample only  rs1361600  found to be associated with the Italian stroke sample and  rs1324214  reported to be associated with CAD in another study, were genotyped.  

DNA was extracted from blood using a standard commercial kit. Genotyping on Italian and German case–control samples was performed by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/restriction fragment length polymorphism protocols. The  rs1361600  was screened as described previously [13]. To analyze the  rs3917629  polymorphism, genomic DNA was ampliﬁed using forward primer   $5^{\prime}$  -AG GAG TAG CT CCA C $\mathrm{CCC}3^{\prime}$   and reverse primer   $5^{\prime}$  -A GC TG GT CCA GAA GCCACC-  $3^{\prime}$     $[95\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}{-}5\mathrm{~}\mathrm{min}$  , 35 cycles  $\times$   $(95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{-}}1~\operatorname*{min}$  ,   $63\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$   $1\ \mathrm{min}$  ,   $72~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.1$   min),   $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C-}7\ \mathrm{min}]$   followed by BstNI endonuclease digestion. To analyze SNP  rs1324214 , genomic DNA was ampliﬁed using forward primer  $5^{\prime}$  -AGGAT T TAG CAA CA AGT CAC $.3^{\prime}$   and reverse primer   $5^{\prime}$  - A GG CAT GG ATC GAGA CACA C-  $.3^{\prime}$     $[95\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}{-}5\mathrm{~}\mathrm{min}$  , 32 cy- cles  ·  (  $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.1$   min,  $56~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}{-1}$   min and 30 s,  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}{-2}\ \mathrm{min}$  ),  $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$   $4\;\mathrm{min}$   followed by MspI end on ucl ease digestion. An internal quality control of DNA with known genotype for TF SNPs evaluated by direct sequencing was used. Moreover,   $5\%$   of DNA samples were retested. A correspondence of   $100\%$  among the genotypes was obtained.  

For US samples, genotyping was done using the MassARRAY System (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) in multiplexes with   $5\;\mathrm{ng}$   of DNA. The whole genome ampliﬁed samples were genotyped in duplicates. An average genotyping success rate of  $97\%$   (range   $93–99\%$  ) was achieved for the SNPs. The missing genotypes were randomly distributed among sexes and case and control samples. The laboratory was blinded to all clinical data during the genotyping. To estimate genotyping error rates, the samples included   $5\%$   blind duplicate samples.  

# Meta-analysis search strategy  

Epidemiological genetic association studies published before March 2009, on ischemic cardiovascular disease and TF gene polymorphisms, were sought by computer-based searches, scanning of the reference lists of articles identiﬁed for all relevant studies and review articles and hand-searching of relevant journals. Computer searches by PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE used keywords related to tissue factor in combination with words related to cardiovascular disease (e.g.

  coronary heart disease  ,   angina  ,   infarction  ,   atherosclerosis  ,

  arteriosclerosis  ,   stenosis  ,   stroke  ,   transient ischemic attack  ,

  cerebro vascular disease  ,   re vascular iz ation  ,   angioplasty  ,   bypass  ,   peripheral arterial disease  ,   death  ) and   polymorphism  ,  mutation  ,   gene  ,   genotype  ,   allele  . Only articles written in English were considered.  

# Statistical analysis  

Given the available sample size, the alternative hypotheses that can be detected with power   $=90\%$  , type I error probability  $=$  0.017, and an expected frequency of the uncommon allel  $\mathrm{~e~}=\,25\%$   in controls, were: odds ratio (OR) lower than 0.4 or greater than 2.0 in the stroke study, OR   $<\,0.5$   or OR   $>\ 1.7$  in the Italian MI study, and OR   $<\ 0.6$   or OR   $>\,1.5$   in the US MI study.  

Chi-square test (or Fisher exact test in the presence of small frequencies) was used to compare categories. Only subjects with at least two of the three Tag-SNPs genotyped for the TF gene were considered for the analyses. Allele and genotype frequencies were determined by genotype count and compared with the values predicted by the assumption of Hardy– Weinberg equilibrium [24]. Odds ratios (OR), together with their  $95\%$   approximate conﬁdence intervals   $95\%$   CI), were calculated using unconditional (conditional in the US) logistic regression analysis. Adjusted ORs were obtained in multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for the variables that associated with MI with a    $P\cdot$  -value   $<\,0.20$   in univariate analysis [25], plus age and sex. Analyses of haplotypes and haplotype-pairs were performed using the software Haplo.Stats (http://www.mayo.edu/statgen) [26]. Haplotypes and haplotype-pairs were inferred using  Haplo.em and only those with estimated frequencies of more than   $2.5\%$  were included in the analysis. The association of inferred haplotypes and haplotype-pairs with outcomes was tested with Haplo.score  and  Haplo.glm  [26–28]. These methods feature an individual  s phenotype as a function of each inferred haplotype and haplotype-pair weighted by their estimated probability. The number of copies of each haplotype was used as the predictor, and the most common haplotype in the block was used as the reference level.  

Haplo.glm  is based on a generalized linear model and computes the regression of a trait on haplotypes with the option of including covariates [27–29]. Haplotype effects were ﬁt as additive, dominant or recessive .  Because  Haplo.stats  does not supply analysis of individually matched data, the association of inferred haplotype-pairs with outcome was tested using SAS by a weighted conditional-logistic regression with weights being haplotypes-pairs probabilities for each individual as inferred by  Haplo.em .  

A two-tailed  $P$   value  $\leq0.05$   was chosen as probing level of sign i can ce. Associations with    $P\le0.05$   were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the method of Sidak [30], considering three SNPs for Italian samples and two for German or combined samples. All computations were performed with the SAS statistical package (Version 9 for Windows; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).  

For the meta-analysis, ﬁxed-effect pooled measures were calculated as the inverse-variance weighted mean of the log odds ratios, considering all the inheritance models: a dominant model (12 combined, 22 in comparison with 11); a recessive model (22 in comparison with 11 plus 12); and a codominant model (11 in comparison, respectively, with 12   and 22). Study heterogeneity was assessed using the  $I^{2}$  statistic.  $\hat{I^{2}}$    describes the percentage of variation in point estimates that might be attributable to true differences across studies rather than to random errors.  

# Results  

The characteristics of cases and controls from the population studied are shown on line (Tables S1–S3). All traditional cardiovascular risk factors were sign i cant ly more frequent in cases than in controls for both MI and stroke patients.  

Allele frequencies were similar in all control samples from the four studies. Genotype distributions in controls were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in all populations.  

# TF genetic variations and risk of MI in Italian and US populations  

There were no statistically signiﬁcant associations between SNPs and risk of MI in either univariate or multivariable analyses both in the Italian and US population (Table 1).  

Analysis of the ha plo types indicated that of the eight potential three-SNP haplotypes for the TF gene seven were inferred with frequencies ranging from   $47.5\%$     $(\mathrm{A}1\,=\,211)$  ) to   $0.07\%$  (HAP_rare   $=\,212$  ), four of them (denoted A1, A2, A3, and A4)having frequency higher than  $2.5\%$  .However,none of these haplotypes was associated with MI in both the Italian and US populations, when haplotype effect was ﬁt as additive (Table 2), dominant or recessive (data not shown), both in univariate and in multivariable analyses. Out of the 36 expected haplotypepairs only 20 were found in the case/control population, with frequencies ranging from  $23.1\%$   (A1/A1) to   $>\;0.01\%$   (A5/A8); nine of them had a frequency higher than  $2.5\%$  , resulting from the combination of haplotype A1,A2,A3 and A4. Therewasno statistically signiﬁcant association between common inferred haplotype-pairs and MI (data not shown).  

# TF genetic variations and risk of ischemic stroke in Italian and German populations  

In multivariate analyses, homo zy gos it y for the T allele of SNP rs1324214 was associated with a reduced risk of stroke as compared with CC homozygotes  $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.36$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.14{\rightarrow}0.90$  ,    $P\,=\,0.011$   in raw analysis and    $P\,=\,0.031$  after Sidak adjustment for multiple comparisons) in the Italian case–control study on juvenile stroke. There were was no statistically signiﬁcant associations between other SNPs and stroke risk after univariate or multivariate analyses (Table 3). SNP rs1324214, together with SNP rs1361600, found to be associated with vascular risk in other studies, was then genotyped in a similar case–control study on German patients with juvenile ischemic stroke. An association of the T allele of the SNP rs1324214 with a reduced risk of stroke was observed (Table 3,   $\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.52$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.31–0.88$   for CT vs. CC,  $P\,=\,0.014$   in raw analysis and    $P\,=\,0.028$   after Sidak adjust- ment). Because allele frequencies of both SNPs were comparable in control subjects of the two populations [rs1324214, allele T frequency 0.28   $95\%\mathrm{~CI}\,=\,0.24{\leftarrow}0.33)$   in Italians and 0.29   $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\,=\,0.24{-}0.33\$   in Germans; rs1361600 allele G frequency 0.46 (0.41–0.51) in Italians and 0.49 (0.44–0.54) in Germans], we performed a combined analysis.

Italian and German populations homo zy gos it y for the T allele of SNP rs1324214 was also associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke at young age (Table 3), although after Sidak adjustment the    $P$   value for association was    $P\,=\,0.056$  . However, test for a codominant effect of the T allele was statistically signiﬁcant (  $P\,=\,0.0078$   in raw and  $P\,=\,0.016$   in Sidak-adjusted analyses).  

Four haplotypes were identiﬁed in the combined populations with a frequency in controls ranging from 0.46 to 0.02. After adjustment for confounding, haplotype 3, containing the rare allele rs1324214 SNP, was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke at young age   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.76$  ,  $95\%$     $\mathrm{CI}\;=\;0.57-$  0.99, Table 4). Similarly, out of nine haplotype-pairs with a frequency higher than   $2.5\%$  , inferred, the pair H3–H3 was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke   $(\mathrm{OR}\,=\,0.43$  ,  $95\%$   $\mathrm{CI}\;=\;0.20{-}0.92$  , data not shown).  

# Meta-analyses  

We found three published articles, with four case–control studies on the association between TF SNPs polymorphisms and ICD. General characteristics and genotype distribution of the published studies and of our four populations are illustrated in Table 5. In total, 3830 cases and 3181 controls were considered. Frequency of the rare allele ranged between

 0.46 and 0.50. The overall ﬁxed effects odds ratio was 1.00

 (  $(95\%$   CI: 0.88–1.12) without any evidence of heterogeneity

  $(I^{2}\,=\,16\%$  ,    $P\,=\,0.31$  ) (Fig. 1). In a recessive inheritance model, the overall ﬁxed effects odds ratio was 1.01   $95\%$   CI: 0.91–1.12) without any evidence of heterogeneity   $(I^{2}\,=\,32\%$  ,  $P\,=\,0.19$  ).  

# Discussion  

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study testing the association between juvenile stroke and TF polymorphisms. In multivariable analysis with the rs1324214 SNP CC genotype used as a reference, homo zy gos it y for the   $\mathrm{T}$   allele was associated with a reduced risk of stroke at young age in two different Caucasian populations recruited in Italy and Germany. This result was strengthened by haplotype analysis by rs  $1324214\mathrm{C}\,>\,\mathrm{T}$   and   $\mathrm{rs}1361600\mathrm{~A~}>\mathrm{~G~}$   showing that both haplotype TA and haplotype pairs TA/TA, were associated with a reduced risk of stroke.

In contrast, neither SNPs nor major haplotypes or haplotype-pairs of the TF gene showed any consistent association with the risk of MI both in the Italian population (where events occurred at young age) and in the population from the US that was characterized by a wider age range. Both the Italian and the US studies were population based. The allele frequencies of the SNPs evaluated were similar in the control samples of the three studies and the genotype distribution in controls were all in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.  

The   $\mathrm{G}$   allele of  $-603$   polymorphism, which corresponds to rs1361600 , had been previously associated with an increased risk of MI [9]; however, this ﬁnding could not be conﬁrmed by our study or by others [9,10].  

Because of the variable results reported in relatively small populations in the literature, a meta-analysis appears to be a suitable instrument to derive an overall conclusion on the sign i can ce of this polymorphism for ICD. The other three studies, analyzing four populations, have shown no association between T F polymorphisms and ischemic heart diseases,mainly MI. They all tested SNPs in almost complete linkage disequilibrium. The cumulative analysis of six populations (four populations in three published studies and two populations reported here) allows a reasonably strong conclusion concerning the lack of association of these polymorphisms with MI. Indeed, there is a consistent homogeneity among all the studies, as reported from the various  $I^{2}$    indexes and relative    $P$   values.  

Ma¨ larstig  et al.  [12], although excluding any association with acute coronary syndrome in case–control studies, found that the polymorphism   $5466\mathrm{~A~}>\mathrm{~G~}$   in intron 2 of the TF gene was associated with cardiovascular death in patients with ACS. Due to the case–control nature of our study we could not investigate this issue and we cannot exclude that polymorphisms of the TF gene can be associated with cardiovascular mortality.  

While coronary syndromes have mainly an at hero sclerotic pathogen es is, and platelet activation subsequent to plaque rupture plays a major role in thrombus formation, ischemic stroke is mainly dependent on the activation of the coagulation system, even in the absence of any atherosclerosis sign. This

different pathogen es is could explain the different role of TF polymorphisms in the risk of such diseases. Moreover, coagulation activation is a major event in deep venous thrombosis [31] for which a slight association with TF polymorphisms was also found [9].  

A strength of the present work was the use of four different case–control studies, all with population-based controls. The results obtained in the Italian population-based study (with MI at young age) were in accordance with those obtained in the population-based study from the US (characterized by a wider range of age). These results reinforce each other and together with the meta-analysis permit us to exclude a role of TF SNPs, haplotypes and haplotype-pairs in the risk of MI. The application of haplotypes and haplotype-pairs analysis is another point of strength. Actually, recent studies have shown that haplotypes and haplotype-pairs can be more relevant for population-based studies [28,29] because they provide more information on allelic diversity than individual SNPs alone. Indeed, haplotypes determine the genetic variance of a locus more accurately than individual SNPs, accounting for the synergic contribution of all SNP alleles along the same DNA strand. Haplotype-pairs, moreover, provide the ﬁnest information on both chromosomes.  

A limitation of the present study is the lack of functional studies. Other authors performed functional analysis showing that TF polymorphisms can affect the synthesis of TF mRNA in vitro  [12–15], or sTF levels [9]. However, only a minor part of TF level variance is very likely to be explained by TF polymorphisms, which could contribute to interpreting negative observations in genotype/clinical phenotype studies.  

Furthermore, as the present study was conducted in tertiarylevel hospitals, it is highly likely that complicated cases (including young patients) were admitted directly or referred from other hospitals to the recruiting centers during the study period, making the number of non-recruited cases negligible.  

Finally, the conclusions of our study should be limited to Caucasian populations only, because the association between ischemic vascular disease and TF polymorphisms cannot be excluded in other ethnic groups.
