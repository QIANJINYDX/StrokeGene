Objective   To investigate whether the polymorphisms of CASP3 gene (rs4647602, intron A/C and rs1049216,  UTR C/T) and CASP9 gene (rs1052576, Gln/Arg G/A and rs1052571, Ser/Val T/C) were associated with the  development, and clinical severity of ischemic stroke and functional consequences after stroke.  

Methods   Genomic DNA from 121 ischemic stroke patients and 201 healthy control subjects were extracted, and  polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced. To investigate the association of polymorphisms and the  development, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (K-NIHSS), logistic regression models were analyzed. Results   Polymorphism of the un translational region of CASP3 (rs1049216, UTR C/T) has been associated with  the development of ischemic stroke—in co dominant 1 model (odds ratio [OR], 0.51;   $95\%$  confidence interval [CI], 

 0.29–0.88;  $\tt p{=}0.017$  ), in dominant model (OR, 0.57;  $95\%$   CI, 0.34–0.97;  $\mathrm{p{=}}0.034$  ), and in the over dominant model (OR, 

 0.50;  $95\%$   CI, 0.29–0.87;  $\mathtt{p}{=}0.011$  ). A missense SNP of CASP9 gene (rs1052571, Ser/Val T/C) was associated with the  development of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.93;   $95\%$   CI, 1.05–3.55;  $\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.034$   in recessive model).  

Conclusion   These results indicate the possibility that CASP3 and CASP9 genes are markers for the development of  ischemic stroke.

# INTRODUCTION  

Ischemic stroke is a cerebro vascular accident caused  by occlusion of cerebral arteries that results in a sud­ den neurologic deficit, such as loss of motor functions,  altered sensations, and impairments of cognition or  language. Despite recent advancements in the preven­ tion and treatment of stroke, the latter event remains the  leading cause of disability and the fifth-leading cause of  death [1]. Especially in those older than 65 years, stroke  is a leading cause of death and disability [2]. Although  stroke has been believed to be a multi factorial disorder  with minimal classical patterns of inheritance, accumu­ lating evidence has shown the importance of genetic fac­ tors [1,3-5].  

Caspases, a family of cysteinyl-aspartate-specific pro­ teases, are executioners of apoptotic cell death and their  activation is considered a commitment to cell death.  They are essential in cells for programmed cell death [6- 8]. Apoptosis has an important role in the pathogen es is  of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction ischemia, auto­ immune diseases, epilepsy, neuro degenerative diseases,  transplantation rejection, traumatic brain injury, and  tumor responses to chemotherapy and radiation [9-11].  

In this study, we investigated whether polymorphisms  of the caspase 3 (CASP3; rs4647602 and rs1049216) and  caspase 9 (CASP9; rs1052576 and rs1052571) genes were  associated with the development, clinical severity or  impediments in daily activities associated with ischemic  stroke.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Subjects  

All participants with stroke were recruited from who  visited in Stroke Center of Kyung Hee University Medical  Center. One hundred and twenty-one patients with isch­ emic stroke (mean age,   $65.21{\pm}8.92\$   years) with ischemic  stroke were enrolled. Patients were diagnosed based on  magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or  angiography. Exclusion criteria included other causes of  cerebro vascular events, including a hemorrhagic stroke,  trauma, vascular malformation, brain tumors, and con­ genital brain disorders.  

Neurological deficits on admission were measured by  using the Korean version of the National Institutes of  Health Stroke Scale (K-NIHSS) within 72 hours after the  onset of a stroke. The neurological outcome was mea­ sured by using a Korean version of the Modified Barthel  Index (K-MBI) within 3–6 months after a stroke. To de­ termine the relationship between caspase gene polymor­ phisms and clinical phenotypes, ischemic stroke patients  were divided into subgroups according to their respective  NIHSS (  $\mathord{\cdot}6$   and  ${\ge}6$  ), and MBI scores (  $\cdot{<}60$   and   ${\ge}60$  ) [12,13]  

Control subjects above 45 years old had any evidence of  prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, intracra­ nial hemorrhage, sub ara ch noid hemorrhage, ischemic  heart diseases, and malignancy.  

This study was approved by the ethics review commit­ tee of the Medical Research Institute, Kyung Hee Univer­ sity School of Medicine. Informed consent of each patient  or guardian was obtained.  

# SNP selection and genotyping  

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of CASP3  (rs4647602 and rs1049216) and CASP9 (rs1052576 and  rs1052571) were searched using a SNP database (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP; dbSNP BUILD 131) of the  National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI),  and we selected the following SNPs, i.e., rs4647602,  rs1049216, rs1052576, and rs1052571. Blood samples  were collected from each subject and then stored in a   $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C refrigerator. Genomic DNA was extracted from the  peripheral blood using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (QIA­ GEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Genotypes were determined  by direct sequencing (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). Poly­ merase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed with  the following primers: for rs4647602 (sense,   $5'$  -GGTG  CTGACTG T GAGA TAC TCG $3^{\prime}$  ; antisense,   $5^{\prime}$  -CACTT  ACT GAGA AT G GG GGAAG $3^{\prime}$  ); for rs1049216 (sense,   $5\,^{\prime}$  -CT G GT GC A GTC AT TAT GAGA GG $\cdot3\,^{\prime}$  ; antisense,   $5'$  -TCAGG A CAA A CAT CACA A AACC-3’); for rs1052576  (sense,   $5'$  -A CG GT CCA GTC T GC ATCTAGACC $\cdot3^{\prime}$  ; anti­ sense,   $5^{\prime}$  -GT T CCC T GG GC A GG CAT T GG GTA-  $\cdot3^{\prime}$  ), and for  rs1052571 (sense,   $5'$  -GG TG GG GAG C GAA G ACT GA CCC- $3^{\prime}$  ; antisense,  $5^{\prime}$  -ACA CCCGA CTA A GAG GT G TTT G-  $3^{\prime}$  ). PCR  products were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3730XL  analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).  Sequence data were analyzed using SeqMan II software  (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). To analyze genetic  data, we used HelixTree (Golden Helix Inc., Bozeman,  MT, USA), SNPStats (http://bioinfo.icon co logia.net/ SNPstats), and SNP Analyzer (ISTECH Inc., Goyang, Korea).  

# Statistical analysis  

The associations between genotypes of SNPs and isch­ emic stroke were estimated by computing the odds ratios  (ORs) and corresponding  $95\%$   confidence intervals (CIs)  with logistic regression analyses, controlling for age and  gender as co variables. Logistic regression analysis with  adjustment for age and gender was performed using the  following criteria: co dominant 1 (major allele homozy­ gotes versus heterozygotes), co dominant 2 (major allele  homozygotes versus minor allele homozygotes), domi­ nant (major allele homozygotes versus heterozygotes  $^+$    minor allele homozygotes), recessive (major allele ho­ mozygotes   $^+$   heterozygotes versus minor allele homozy­ gotes), over dominant (major allele homozygotes   $^+$  minor  allele homozygotes vs. heterozygotes) and log-additive  (major allele homozygotes vs. heterozygotes vs. minor al­ lele homozygotes). An analysis was performed to identify  correlations between the polymorphisms and the scores  of K-MBI and K-NIHSS by same logistic regression analy­ ses.  

The significance level for all statistical tests was set at   $\mathrm{p}{<}0.05$  . Linkage d is equilibrium (LD) blocks and haplo­ types were evaluated using HaploView ver. 4.2 (Daly Lab  Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA).  

# RESULTS  

# Subjects  

Three hundred and twenty-two subjects were included,  121 subjects were the patients with ischemic stroke (IS  group), and 201 were healthy persons (control group).  The mean age of patients with ischemic stroke was   $65.21\pm8.92$   years, and the mean age of control group  was   $61.34{\pm}11.32\$   years. The numbers of ischemic stroke  patients with NIHSS score   ${<}6$   and   ${\ge}6$   were 51 and 50, re­ spectively. The numbers of ischemic stroke patients with  MBI score   ${\le}60$   and  ${>}60$   were 62 and 23, respectively (Table 1).

are no statistically significant results in logistic regres­ sion. A polymorphism of the un translational region of  CASP3 (rs1049216) has been associated with the develop­ ment of ischemic stroke—in co dominant 1 model (OR, 

 0.51;   $95\%$   CI, 0.29–0.88;  $\mathtt{p}{=}0.017]$  ), in dominant model 

 (OR, 0.57;   $95\%$   CI, 0.34–0.97;  $\mathbf{p{=}}0.034$  ), and in the over­ dominant model (OR, 0.50;   $95\%$   CI, 0.29–0.87;   $\mathtt{p}{=}0.011$  ) 

 (Table 2). Whereas the missense SNP of CASP9 gene 

 (rs1052576, Gln/Arg) was not associated with the devel­ opment of ischemic stroke   $\scriptstyle\left(\mathbf{p}>0.05\right)$  , another missense  SNP of CASP9 gene (rs1052571, Ser/Val) was associated  with the development of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.93;   $95\%$    CI, 1.05–3.55;  $\mathbf{p{=}}0.034.$  ) in recessive model (Table 3). Gen­ otype and allele frequency of the SNPS of CASP3 gene  (rs4647602 and rs1049216) and CASP9 gene (rs1052576  and rs1052571) was not associated with K-NIHSS and KMBI scores   $\mathrm{(p{>}0.05)}$  .  

# Haplotypes  

HaploView ver. 4.2 was used to evaluate the LD block  and haplotypes of the SNPs of CASP3 (rs4647602 and  rs1049216) and CASP9 (rs1052576 and rs1052571). A  moderate LD block was found between rs4647602 and  rs1049216 (  $\mathrm{\DeltaD^{\prime}{=}0.858}$  ;   $95\%$   CI, 0.71–0.94; =0.156) (Fig. 1).  A complete LD block was detected between rs1052576  and rs1052571 (  $\bf\Pi^{\prime}\bf{D}^{\prime}\bf{=}\bf{1}$   and   $\scriptstyle\mathbf{r}^{2}=1$  =1) (Fig. 2).  

Values of   $\left\vert\mathbf{D}^{\prime}\right\vert$   are divided into three categories: strong  LD (  $\mathbf{\chi}[\mathbf{D}^{\prime}]$   near 1, which implies little or no evidence of

Two or more sites can be grouped  together into a block if the outermost pair of sites is in  strong LD, and, if, for all pairwise comparisons in the LD  block, the number of pairs in strong LD is at least 19-fold  greater than the number of pairs in weak LD [14].  

When the analysis of haplotype was performed, there  was no significant differences of the haplotype of CASP3  and CASP9 and the development of ischemic stroke (Ta­ bles 4, 5).  

# DISCUSSION  

Apoptosis is a process by which a stressed or damaged  cell commits ‘suicide.’ Caspases are key mediators of  apoptosis that are activated in distinct molecular path­ ways. Caspase-3 is important in the apoptosis pathway,  and plays decisive roles in the activation of microglia  and inflammation-mediated neuro toxicity play a deci­ sive role in the pathogen es is of a few neuro degenerative  disorders, including Parkinson disease and Alzheimer  disease [6,15]. Active caspase-9, a member of the cas­ pase family of proteases, is an initiator caspase protease  apoptosis and plays an important role in mitochondrial  programmed cell death. The intrinsic or mitochondrial  pathway is initiated by the release of cytochrome c from  mitochondria in response. Recent investigations have  reported that following cerebral ischemia, caspase-3 to a  variety of cellular stress [16]. Knockout mice had smaller  infarct volumes than wild-type mice [17]. Moreover, mice  over-expressing human caspase-3 presented increased  apoptosis and larger lesion volumes after transient focal  cerebral ischemia [18]. Kuida et al. [19] studied cells from  caspase-9 deficient mice show resistance to apoptosis  induced by a variety of cytotoxic drugs and radiation.  Akpan et al. [20] identified caspases that are critical for  neuro degeneration in cerebral ischemia. Their data show  that caspases-9 is a regulator of neuro degeneration in  cerebral ischemia and an early-stage mediator that also  promotes caspase-6 activation of cell death in stroke.  

In this study, a SNP of CASP3 (rs1049216, UTR) was  associated with the development of ischemic stroke— co dominant 1 (OR, 0.51;  $\mathtt{p}{=}0.017]$  ), dominant (OR, 0.57;   $\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.034\big)$  ), over dominant model (OR,   $0.50;\,\mathbf{p}{=}0.011$  ), and  a SNP of CASP9 (rs1052571, Ser/Val) also correlates with  ischemic stroke—recessive model (OR, 1.93;  $\mathtt{p}\!\!=\!\!0.034$  ).  

In rs1049216, compared with other zygotes, it can be  seen that heterozygotes (T/C genotype) showed a protec­ tive effect in the codominant model and over dominant  model and compared with other zygotes, major allele  homozygotes (CC genotype) were found to act as risk  factors in the dominant model. Compared with other  zygotes, in rs1052571, minor allele homozygotes (CC  genotype) were found to act as risk factors in the reces­ sive model. However, the SNPs of CASP3 (rs4647602) and  CASP9 (rs1052576) were not associated with ischemic  stroke. To our knowledge, this is the first report that syn­ onymous SNPs of CASP3 (rs1049216) and CASP9 genes  (rs1052571) may be associated with the development of

ischemic stroke. We also studied the genotype frequen­ cies of CASP3 and CASP9 polymorphisms in K-NIHSS  and K-MBI. However, we did not find any significant as­ sociations between the clinical status of stroke and CASP  polymorphisms.  

This study had several limitations. First, there is the  possibility of selection bias because this study targeted  hospital-based samples and not the general population.  Second, the adjustment for risk factors (cigarettes, hy­ pertension, diabetes, hyper lipid emi a) related to the de­ velopment of ischemic stroke and ischemic stroke onset  origin was not carried out. Third, the long-term effects  of SNPs cannot be seen because functional outcome was  not measured serially. Large-scale, long-term studies to  considered pathogen es is such as risk factors, stroke ori­ gin, mutation and adjacent genetic sequences seem to be  needed for additional studies.  

In summery, the synonymous SNPs of CASP3 (rs1049216)  and CASP9 genes (rs1052571) were associated with the  development ischemic stroke.
