OBJECTIVE — The plasma a dip one ct in level, a potential upstream and internal facet of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, has a reasonably high heritability. Whether other novel genes in ﬂ uence the variation in a dip one ct in level and the roles of these genetic variants on subsequent clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we aimed not only to identify genetic variants modulating plasma a dip one ct in levels but also to investigate whether these variants are associated with a dip one ct in-related metabolic traits and cardiovascular diseases.  

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with high molecular weight forms of a dip one ct in levels by genotyping 382 young-onset hypertensive (YOH) subjects with Illumina Human Hap 550 SNP chips. The culpable single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants responsible for lowered a dip one ct in were then con ﬁ rmed in another 559 YOH subjects, and the association of these SNP variants with the risk of metabolic syndrome (MS), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and ischemic stroke was examined in an independent community – based prospective cohort, the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtors Two-township Study (CVDFACTS,  $n=3{,}350$  ).  

RESULTS — The SNP (rs4783244) most signi ﬁ cantly associated with a dip one ct in levels was located in intron 1 of the T-cadherin ( CDH13 ) gene in the  ﬁ rst stage   $\phantom{0}{(P=7.57}\times10^{-9}\phantom{.}$  ). We replicated and con ﬁ rmed the association between rs4783244 and plasma a dip one ct in levels in an additional 559 YOH subjects   $(P=5.70\ \times$   $10^{\,\div17}$  ). This SNP was further associated with the risk of MS (odds ratio  $\mathrm{\left[OR\right]=1.42}$  ,  $P=0.027$  ), T2DM in men   $\mathrm{{OR}=3.25}$  ,  $P=0.{\overset{.}{0}}265$  ), and ischemic stroke (  $\mathrm{{OR}=2.13}$  ,  $P=0.002]$  ) in the CVDFACTS.  

CONCLUSIONS — These  ﬁ ndings indicated the role of T-cadherin in modulating a dip one ct in levels and the involvement of  CDH13 or a dip one ct in in the development of car dio metabolic diseases. Diabetes  60:2417 – 2423, 2011  

A diponectin plays vital roles in modulating insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and anti at hero sclerotic and antiin ﬂ ammatory responses in the vascular system (1,2). The concentration of a dip one ct in, the most abundant adipokine secreted by adipocytes, ranges from 4 to  $30~\upmu\mathrm{g/mL}$  in the blood, which is much higher than the concentrations of various other hormones and cytokines (3). Decreased levels of plasma a dip one ct in are associated with an increased risk of not only obesity (4) and metabolic syndrome (MS) (5) but also type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (6), hypertension (7), myocardial infarction (8), and ischemic stroke (9). Animal studies and cell culture experiments have shown that direct stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis is responsible for the anti-in ﬂ ammatory mechanism and anti a the rogen ic effects of a dip one ct in (10). These  ﬁ ndings give biological plausibility to the phenomenon that the decreased plasma levels of a dip one ct in may directly lead to the development of insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and not merely be a consequence of the MS. Therefore, understanding the genetic mechanisms involved in the modulation of plasma a dip one ct in levels in the human body will provide insights into the cause and management of MS.  

The plasma a dip one ct in levels, a potential upstream and internal facet of metabolic disease and CVD (11), have a reasonably high heritability with an estimated range of  $40-$   $80\%$   (12,13). Although the  $A D I P O Q$   and  ARL15  genes identi ﬁ ed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been associated with a dip one ct in levels in white populations (14 – 16), whether other genes in ﬂ uence the changes in a dip one ct in level and the roles of these genetic variants on subsequent clinical outcomes, including MS, T2DM, and coronary artery disease, has not been carefully investigated, especially in Asian populations.  

We performed a GWAS to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) regulating the a dip one ct in levels by using phenotypic and genotypic information of 941 youngonset hypertensive (YOH) subjects, including the Illumina Human Hap 550 SNP data for the initial 382 subjects. Three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants responsible for lowered a dip one ct in levels showed genome-wide signi ﬁ cance in both the  ﬁ rst-stage (with 382 YOH cases) and the second-stage (with 559 YOH cases) studies; subsequently, we determined the association of these SNP variants with the risk of MS, T2DM, and ischemic stroke in an independent large-scale, community-based prospective cohort study, the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtors Two-township Study (CVDFACTS).  

# RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  

GWAS using the data collected for YOH patients to determine QTL in ﬂ uencing the plasma a dip one ct in levels.  We performed a two-stage GWAS to identify the genes/loci that in ﬂ uence the plasma a dip one ct in levels. In this study, we included 941 hypertensive subjects recruited by the Academia Sinica Multi centered Young-Onset Hypertension Genetic Study: 382 in the  ﬁ rststage genome-wide scan and 559 in the second-stage con ﬁ rmatory study. The inclusion criteria for hypertensive subjects are as follows:    $\mathit{\Delta}I$  ) systolic blood pressure  ${\geq}140\ \mathrm{mmHg}$   or diastolic blood pressure  ${\geq}90~\mathrm{mmHg}$   over a 2-month period or systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure    ${\geq}120/80\ \mathrm{mmHg}$   in patients taking anti hypertensive medications in two consecutive visits within 2 months;  $\mathcal{Z}$  ) age between 20 and 51 years at the  ﬁ rst diagnosis of hypertension; 3 ) no secondary causes of hypertension, such as chronic renal disease, renal arterial stenosis, primary aldo ster on is m, coa rct ation of the aorta, thyroid disorders, Cushing syndrome, and phe och romo cyto ma con ﬁ rmed by extensive clinical examinations, including blood chemistry examination, renal function tests, endocrine examination, and abdominal sonogram;  4 ) fasting glucose (FG) level    ${<}126~\mathrm{mg/GL};\,5$  ) BMI    ${<}35~\mathrm{kg/m^{2}}$  , where BMI was de ﬁ ned as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; and    $^{6}$  ) self-reported Han Chinese ethnicity in more than 2 generations.  

Data were collected according to standardized protocols. Blood pressure was measured according to the protocol established for the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (17). Serum levels of high molecular weight forms of a dip one ct in for all samples were assayed by Taipei Institute of Pathology (Taipei, Taiwan) using the enzyme immuno as say kit (a dip one ct in [human] ELISA kit; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc., Belmont, CA). A subsample of 40 samples was analyzed in duplicate. The averaged coef ﬁ cient of variation was  $4.97\%$  . In addition, the data on socio demographic factors, smoking and drinking habits, medical history, and current medications were obtained by interviewing the subjects. Our multi center study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of Academia Sinica. Informed consent was obtained from each participant at his/her  ﬁ rst visit to the clinic.  

Prospective study to determine the association between QTL of a dip one ct in and metabolic traits, T2DM, and ischemic stroke.  The study subjects included those who were recruited for the CVDFACTS, which has been described (18,19). In brief, the CVDFACTS is a community-based follow-up cohort study designed to evaluate the risk factors of CVD and metabolic disease in Taiwan. This study was initiated in 1993, and all residents aged more than 3 years in Chu-Dung (northwest Taiwan) and Pu-Tzu (southwest Taiwan) were invited to participate in the baseline examination. The follow-up examinations were performed in 1994 – 1997, 1997 – 1999, and 2000 – 2002. Data on socio demographic factors, an thro po metric parameters, smoking and drinking habits, medical history, and current medications were obtained by interviewing the subjects, and fasting blood was drawn for biochemical examination, including measurement of the levels of serum glucose, triglyceride (TG), insulin, and so forth. Insulin sensitivity was estimated based on the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) formula (serum glucose levels  $\times$   insulin/22.5). Intima – media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery was assessed for those aged  ${\geq}30$   years by high-resolution B-mode carotid ultra sonography using a 7.5-MHz transducer (Phillips Medical Systems NA, Bothell, WA). The IMT as the distance between the leading edges of the lumen – intima and media – adventitia interfaces was measured along the near and far wall of the distal  $10{\mathrm{-mm}}$   portion of the common carotid artery and along a  $15{\mathrm{-mm}}$   section from the carotid bifurcation in the plaque-free area. The thickness was measured manually and recorded. The largest value among all the readings was considered as the maximal IMT. Participants in our study were aged  ${\geq}20$   years with no history of stroke, cancer, or CVD at the time of data entry. Ischemic stroke status was determined based on information in death certi ﬁ cate data, insurance claim records, and hospital record. Detailed rules have been published (19). More detailed information of the baseline characteristics of CVD cohort study is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Our study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of Academia Sinica.  

Genotyping methods.  Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of hypertensive subjects using the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for the YOH genetic study and the phenol/ chloroform method for the CVDFACTS. For the GWAS, genotyping experiments were performed by deCODE genetics (Reykjavik, Iceland) by using the Illumina In ﬁ nium II Human Hap 550 SNP chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to analyze data from 382 leukocyte DNA samples. We followed the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium criteria for quality control (20); only those individuals in whom more than  $3\%$   of the required data were missing were excluded. The SNPs were excluded if they showed violation of the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium   $(P<$   $1\times{10}^{-7})$  , call rates  ${\tt<}95\%$  , or minor allele frequency  ${<}1\%.$  . One SNP located at intron 1 of  CDH13  with  $-\mathrm{log}\,P\,{\geq}7$   and two additional SNPs located at intron 1  $(P=4.10\times10^{-6})$   and promoter   $(P=4.88\times10^{-5})$   of  CDH13  gene in the  ﬁ rst stage were genotyped in the second stage for further con ﬁ rmation. The genotyping of the three SNPs for the samples in the second-stage con ﬁ rmation study and for the CVDFACTS subjects was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY System (San Diego, CA) by the Academia Sinica National Genotyping Center (Taipei, Taiwan).  

Statistical analysis.  We performed a two-stage genome-wide QTL mapping for a dip one ct in levels. The general linear model (GLM) was used for associating a dip one ct in levels with genotype data, making adjustments for sex, age, smoking, and BMI in the  ﬁ rst- and second-stage analyses, where the distribution of a dip one ct in levels was normalized by taking a square root transformation of the original values because of the skewed distributions of the original values. In the  ﬁ rst stage, the genome-wide signi ﬁ cance level was set to be   $1\,\times\,10^{-7}$   $(\approx\!0.05/509{,}174)$   according to the Bonferroni multiple testing correction (20). A multiple regression model was used to estimate the degree of variation in plasma a dip one ct in levels explained by the selected SNPs using the combined data from the  ﬁ rst and second stages. An examination of possible population strati ﬁ cation was carried out using multidimensional scaling analysis of PLINK software (21). Quantile – quantile plot of the genome-wide QTL mapping was also drawn to examine  $P$   value distributions based on 382 YOH patients.  

The levels of serum glucose, HOMA-IR, and TG were analyzed after obtaining the square root of the original value because of the skewed distributions of these values in CVDFACTS in which a dip one ct in QTL was examined against the aforementioned car dio metabolic outcomes. Analysis of GLM was used to compare the mean levels of metabolic parameters among genotype groups with adjustments for age, sex, smoking, and medication for T2DM as covariates. The relationship between the SNP rs4783244 and the presence of MS, T2DM, hypertension, and stroke was examined by using dichotomous logistic regression analyses with adjustments for age, BMI, sex, and smoking. With the exception of the evaluation of population strati ﬁ cation, all other statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).  

# RESULTS  

Characteristics of subjects in the Academia Sinica Multi centered Young-Onset Hypertension Genetic Study.  No signi ﬁ cant differences were observed between subjects in the  ﬁ rst and second stages (Table 1) with respect to sex distribution, mean levels of LDL and a dip one ct in, and proportion of smoking status. Signi ﬁ cant differences were noted in the mean age and BMI of the subjects. The subjects in the second stage were 4 years older than those in the  ﬁ rst stage, but the magnitude of the difference in BMI was small.  

GWAS  ﬁ ndings.  The results of principal component analysis in stage 1 revealed no evidence for population strati ﬁ - cation for hypertensive subjects. Multidimensional scaling analysis using PLINK also showed similar results (Supplementary Fig. 1).  

To identify the QTLs in ﬂ uencing the a dip one ct in levels, we performed GLM with adjustments for age, sex, BMI, and smoking to reduce the potential confounding effects. The major results of the GWAS for a dip one ct in levels are shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. The SNP

Data are given in percentage or mean  $\pm$   SE.  $\dagger\mathbf{A}\ t$   or  $\chi^{2}$    test was used to make comparisons between the  ﬁ rst- and second-stage samples in the GWAS with a signi ﬁ cance level set at  $P=0.05$  .

(rs4783244) most signi ﬁ cantly associated with a dip one ct in levels was located in intron 1 of the  CDH13  gene   $(P=7.57\times$   ${10}^{\ensuremath{-}9})$  ; this SNP was selected for the second-stage con ﬁ rmatory study, because no other SNPs had a  – log  $P$   value greater than 7. In addition to the most signi ﬁ cant SNP

 (rs4783244), two SNPs located at promoter (rs7193788;

  $\dot{P}=4.88\times\dot{10}^{-5}\dot{)}$  ) and intron 1 of  CDH13  locus (rs8047711;  $P=4.10\times10^{-65}$   were also selected based on the location of SNPs and  $P$   value of the genome-wide scan. We selected these three candidate SNPs for con ﬁ rmation in the second stage by examining an additional 559 YOH patients. The three SNPs again showed signi ﬁ cant associations with a dip one ct in levels (Table 2): rs4783244   $(P=5.70\times10^{-17})$  ), rs8047711   $(P\,=\,6.3\dot{2}\,\times\,10^{\,\cdot\,8})$  ), and rs7193788   $(P=1.36\ \times$   ${10}^{\ensuremath{-}9})$  . The SNP rs4783244 that showed the most signi ﬁ cant association accounted for   $9.28\%$   of the total variance of a dip one ct in levels in the combined data analysis of 941 hypertensive subjects (Table 2), which was more signi ﬁ - cant than the other two SNPs.  

We further examined the association for loci previously reported in the GWAS or candidate gene study. We did not observe the associations with SNPs in  ADIPOQ  (rs16861194 and rs3774262,  $P=0.648$   and  $P=0.529]$  ),  ARL15  (rs4311394,  $P=0.027^{}$  ),  ADIPOR1  (rs10753929,  $P=0.03$  ), and  ADIPOR2

 (rs4766413,  $P\,=\,0.128)$  ) after multiple testing corrections

 (Table 2).  

Association between rs4783244 in  CDH13  and metabolic traits.  Because of a strong linkage d is equilibrium among these three SNPs in the  CDH13  gene   $(\mathrm{D^{\prime}~=~1}$  among three SNPs), we selected the most signi ﬁ cant SNP, rs4783244, to further determine its association with other metabolic parameters, including hypertension, waist circumference (WC), and the levels of HDL-cholesterol, TG, and FG for the samples in CVDFACTS. The SNP rs4783244 was signi ﬁ cantly associated with WC   $(P=0.014)$  ) and the levels of TG   $(P=0.010)$  ) and FG   $(P=0.024)$  , whereas it was not signi ﬁ cantly associated with HDL-cholesterol levels and hypertension in the CVDFACTS samples (Table 3). The GG genotype of rs4783244 was associated with WC, a low a dip one ct in level, a high level of TG and FG, and an increased risk of MS (odds ratio   $[\mathrm{OR}]=1.42$   [CI 1.04 – 1.95],  $P=0.0273$  ; Table 3).  

No signi ﬁ cant associations were observed between the genotypes of rs4783244 and HOMA-IR or T2DM without strati ﬁ cation of the sex (data not shown). However, in the male subgroup, the SNP rs4783244 was signi ﬁ cantly associated with HOMA-IR   $(P\,=\,0.033)$  . The HOMA-IR levels increased with the number of the G allele of rs4783244 in a dominant fashion; GG and GT genotypes of rs4783244 were signi ﬁ cantly associated with T2DM in a similar manner   $\mathrm{\bar{(OR=3.25}}$   [CI 1.15 – 9.19],  $P=0.0259$   and   $\mathrm{OR}=3.50$  [1.24 – 9.8],  $P\,=\,0.0184$  , respectively; Table 4). However, none of the associations with HOMA-IR and T2DM were detected in the female subgroup. We further conducted a test for the   $\mathbf{r}\mathbf{s}4783244^{*}$   interactions between the sexes. We observed a statistically signi ﬁ cant interaction effect between the rs4783244 genotypes and sex (  $P$   for interaction  $=0.05$  ). Because a higher proportion of smokers are men than women   $(<\!1\%)$  , we investigated whether it is in smokers that rs4783244 exacts its effect. However, we

found that there was no interaction between smoking and rs4783244 in men (  ${\cal P}$   for interaction  $=0.159)$  ).  

Association between rs4783244 in  CDH13  and IMT and the risk of ischemic stroke.  Results from the GLM with adjustments for sex, age, and smoking showed that the mean IMT was associated with rs4783244   $(P=0.048)$  ). The mean IMT increased with the GG genotype of rs4783244 in a recessive fashion   $(P\,=\,0.026)$  ). We further compared the risk of ischemic stroke between people with GG and people with combined TT and GT genotypes. Similar to the  ﬁ ndings for IMT, the risk of ischemic stroke increased with the GG genotype of rs4783244 (OR, 2.13 [CI 1.33 – 3.39],  $P=0.002$  ; Table 5).  

To summarize, the G allele at rs4783244 was consistently associated with deleterious states of the  ﬁ ve metabolic traits examined and with an increased risk of MS, T2DM (in men), and ischemic stroke.  

# DISCUSSION  

We performed a GWAS for high molecular weight forms of a dip one ct in levels and found a QTL on CDH13 that affects a dip one ct in levels. This a dip one ct in QTL was recently reported for Filipinos by Wu et al. (22) and Koreans by Jee et al. (23). We are the  ﬁ rst to  ﬁ nd this a dip one ct in   $\mathrm{QTTL}$   in Chinese and to show that this QTL was associated with metabolic traits and the risk of MS, T2DM (in men), and stroke. These  ﬁ ndings may broaden our understanding of the mechanisms modulating a dip one ct in levels and the role of adiponectin in the development of metabolic disease and CVD.  

Several GWAS have been performed for a dip one ct in levels. Wu et al. (22) and Jee et al. (23) found that SNPrs3865188 on the  CDH13  locus was associated with high molecular weight forms of a dip one ct in levels in an Asian population. The rs4783244   $({\bar{\bf D}^{\prime}}~=~0.94\$  ;    $r^{2}\,=\,0.9)$   SNP found in our study was in strong linkage d is equilibrium with this SNP. Another family study (15) revealed that rs7195409 (which did not reach a genome-wide signi ﬁ - cance) on intron 7 of the CDH13 locus potentially affects a dip one ct in levels in subjects of northern and western European origin. We tried to compare allele frequencies of 10 previously reported associated SNPs in the  ADIPOQ gene (22) between Asians and Europeans. No polymorphisms were found for two of them in Asians, namely, rs17300539 and rs17366568. Allele frequencies of the other eight SNPs differed from Europeans by   $3{-}16\%$  .

TG, glucose, and HDL-cholesterol levels and WC were averaged by genotypes of rs4783244.  $\dag{P}$   values were obtained from logistic regression analysis with adjustments for age, sex, and smoking.

HOMA-IR strati ﬁ ed by sex was averaged by genotypes of rs4783244. DM, diabetes mellitus.    $\dag{P}$   values were obtained from GLM with adjustments for age and smoking.  $\ddagger P$   values were obtained from logistic regression analysis with adjustments for age and smoking.  

Only one of the eight is included in the Illumina In ﬁ nium II Human Hap 550 SNP chips. We did not have the opportunity to study the association between these seven SNPs and a dip one ct in levels. In addition to the polymorphisms at the ADIPOQ  locus (14 – 16), a previous study (16) revealed that ARL15 , whose functions were unknown, in ﬂ uenced circulating a dip one ct in levels and moderately increased the risk of coronary heart disease. We showed that a variant of CDH13 , but not that of  ADIPOQ  and  ARL15 , was associated with a dip one ct in levels. This discrepancy in results may be explained by population-speci ﬁ c genetic variants, limited sample sizes to detect the modest associations, and varied coverage of different whole-genome SNP – genotyping platforms. Similar to our study, the small scale study conducted by Jee et al. (23) in Korea did not show an association between a dip one ct in levels and  ADIPOQ  or  ARL15 . Our study further showed that the  CDH13  variant had moderate effects on metabolic traits and on the increased risk of MS, T2DM, and ischemic stroke.  CDH13  is located at chromosome 16q24 (24) and encodes the cadherinrelated superfamily of trans membrane proteins that mediate calcium-dependent inter cellular adhesion.  CDH13  is highly expressed in several tissues (heart, aortic wall, neurons of the brain cortex and spinal cord, and small blood vessels) and in a variety of cell types (vascular endo the li al cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, car dio myo cyte s, and cancer cells) (25 – 28). Studies on cellular signaling have suggested that both LDL and a dip one ct in were speci ﬁ c ligands for T-cadherin, a product of  CDH13  (29 – 31). Binding of LDL or a dip one ct in to T-cadherin is capable of activating nuclear factor $\cdot\kappa\mathrm{B}$     $(\mathrm{NF}_{-}\kappa\mathrm{B})$  ) signaling pathway (29), which plays a central role in in ﬂ ammation and serves as a link between obesity and vascular disease (32). T-cadherin expression in the arterial wall after balloon angioplasty is associated with late stages of neointima formation and with the peak of proliferation and differentiation of vascular cells (33). This evidence suggests that T-cadherin, by modulating the levels of a dip one ct in in the blood and in various tissues, may regulate vascular remodeling, neointima formation, and in ﬂ ammation-related phenomena and atherosclerosis development. Two additional a dip one ct in receptors have been identi ﬁ ed in the skeletal muscle (AdipoR1) and liver (AdipoR2) by expression cloning (34). Both receptors activate adenosine monophosphate – activated protein kinase and peroxisome pro life rat or – activated receptor    $\upalpha$   metabolic pathways that mediate the major metabolic effects of a dip one ct in, such as those on glucose uptake and fattyacid oxidation, which are critical components in the development of obesity, T2DM, and CVD (35,36). T-cadherin not only competes with a dip one ct in receptors R1 and R2 for a dip one ct in binding but also interferes with the coupling of both receptors to their downstream intracellular targets (37). All of these data provide evidence of the role of CDH13  and of the complexity in the development of cardio metabolic diseases.  

In an attempt to dissect the interrelationship among CDH13, obesity, and car dio metabolic diseases, we included BMI as a covariate. Our data show that the direction of association between all components of MS and rs4783244 remained the same, but they were no longer statistically signi ﬁ cant, indicating that the genetic effects of  CDH13 - rs4783244 on these metabolic traits may be mediated in part by BMI. However, the  $P$   value for the association with stroke, MS, and diabetes remained signi ﬁ cant at 0.0035,  

TABLE 5 Associations between rs4783244 on  CDH13  and IMT and the risk of ischemic stroke 
![](images/c4dc9d724904e7e2676c38659b979b893a902a68c110cb77e02f2f285a301f58.jpg)  
 $\dag{P}$   values were obtained from the GLM procedure with adjustments for age, sex, and smoking.    $\ddagger P$   values were obtained from logistic regression analysis with adjustments for age, sex, and smoking.  

0.026, and 0.03, respectively. These  ﬁ ndings indicate that rs4783244 has its independent effects on MS co morbidity, stroke, and diabetes.  

An association between rs4783244 and HOMA-IR/T2DM was found in men but not in women. A question arises whether smoking plays any role to augment the effect of this polymorphism in men. Smoking has been known to be associated with increased oxidative stress that induces production of in ﬂ ammatory cytokines, resulting in endo the li al dysfunction and increasing the risk for atherosclerosis (38). The interaction between a dip one ct in and its receptor CDH13 may trigger the  $\mathrm{NF}_{\mathrm{KB}}$   signaling pathway and in turn affect the development of car dio metabolic diseases, also via the in ﬂ ammatory pathway. Smoking may interact with  CDH13 - rs4783244 and affect the development of car dio metabolic diseases. However, no signi ﬁ cant interaction between rs4783244 and smoking was found for T2DM and stroke in men in our study. Among alternative reasons for the difference between the sexes is that plasma a dip one ct in levels generally are higher in women than in men (39), which may protect women more against T2DM. Because we did not measure a dip one ct in levels in the CVDFACTS, we could not examine how the sex interacts with a dip one ct in level to affect the risk of T2DM.  

Our study has some other limitations. First, this GWAS was performed in hypertensive subjects. Further studies should be performed in the general population. Second, the number of subjects in our study is generally regarded as small for a GWAS. However, the power for identifying QTLs of a dip one ct in levels is in general greater than that in complex diseases.  

A moderate association was also observed between SNP rs11068544 on chromosome 12 and a dip one ct in levels  $(P\operatorname{value}=1.78\times10^{-6})$  . This SNP lies in intron 5 of kinase suppressor of ras 2 (KSR2), which acts as a negative regulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAP3K3)-mediated activation of extracellular signal – related kinase (ERK), Jun   $\mathrm{NH_{2}}$  -terminal kinase, and   $\bar{\mathrm{NF}}\kappa\mathbf{B}$   pathways, inhibiting the MAP3K3-mediated proin ﬂ ammatory pathway and down regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase 3-induced interleukin-8 production in response to interleukin-1B stimulation (40). Although the magnitude of association did not reach genome-wide threshold for statistical signi ﬁ cance, KSR2 also stimulates fatty acids oxidation via the adenosine monophosphate – activated protein kinase pathway. These features may make the  KSR2 gene a promising candidate for a dip one ct in levels regulation. Further large-scale con ﬁ rmatory studies will be re- quired to clarify this association.  

In conclusion, our study provides evidence that a GWAS has the potential to reveal genetic in ﬂ uences on a clear biochemical trait such as a dip one ct in levels. We have implicated that  CDH13  has an in ﬂ uence not only on adiponectin levels in the blood but also on the risk of MS, T2DM, and ischemic stroke. These  ﬁ ndings support the pathogenic role of  CDH13  in metabolic diseases and in atherothrombotic stroke and suggest the potential application of CDH13  as a target for disease prevention and management.
