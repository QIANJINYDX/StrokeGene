# Abstract  

Objective— We assessed the association of genetic variation in MMP3 and MMP9 with risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.  

Methods— A case-control study was conducted among members of Group Health (GH), a large integrated health care delivery system. Case subjects with incident non-fatal myocardial infarction  $\mathbf{\left(n}=854\right)}$  ), ischemic stroke (  $\mathbf{\tilde{n}}=367$  ), and hemorrhagic stroke   $\mathbf{(n=66)}$  ) were identified and validated. A matched control group was selected from among GH members without myocardial infarction or stroke   $\mathrm{(n{=}2696)}$  ). Haplotype-tagging sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MMP3 and MMP9 were genotyped.  

Results— MMP3 haplotype 2 was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per copy  $=0.80$  ,  $95\%$   confidence interval 0.66, 0.98) and increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke   $(\mathrm{OR}=1.69$  ,   $95\%$   confidence interval 1.05, 2.75). Results for MMP3 haplotype 2 and ischemic stroke resembled those for myocardial infarction but did not achieve statistical significance (  $\mathrm{{OR}}=0.85$  ,  $95\%$   confidence interval 0.64, 1.12). No individual SNP identified MMP3 haplotype 2, and none of the individual MMP3 SNPs were associated with myocardial infarction or stroke. MMP9 haplotypes or SNPs were not associated with myocardial infarction or stroke.  

Conclusions— MMP3 haplotype may predict both cardiac events and stroke.  

# Keywords  

Matrix metal lo protein as es (MMPs) are a family of more than 20 zinc-dependent protein as es with pro teo ly tic activity against extracellular matrix (ECM) components including collagen and elastin, as well as numerous proteins involved in ang io genesis, cell migration, growth and apoptosis[1]. Each MMP has distinct although overlapping substrate specific i ties. Previous studies have suggested that MMPs may play a role in cardiovascular and cerebro vascular diseases. Human atheroma specimens display increased MMP-3 and MMP-9 expression in plaque shoulder regions and regions of foam cell accumulation [2]. MMP-2 is constitutive ly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), localized in astrocytic processes in proximity to blood vessels, ependymal, and pial cells [3]. Expression of other MMPs including MMP-3 and MMP-9 in the brain and cerebral vas cula ture is low in the basal state, but may be up regulated in inflammatory responses [3].  

Inter-individual variation in expression and activity of MMP3 and MMP9 appears to have a substantial genetic component. The population distribution of plasma MMP-9 levels has a bimodal distribution, suggesting the existence of distinct genotypic classes [1]. The 5A/6A polymorphism in the MMP3 promoter region   $(-1612)$   is a widely-studied gene locus. The 6A allele has been associated with lower promoter activity [4,5] and in turn, with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in several studies [5–9]. Relatively few studies to date have examined haplotypic variation in MMP genes in relation to risk of cardiovascular and cerebro vascular disease [7,10].  

In the present study, we examined whether common genetic variation in MMP3 and MMP9 predicted risk of incident myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke in a population-based, case-control study.  

# METHODS  

# Setting  

The setting for this case-control study was Group Health (GH), an integrated health care delivery system based in Seattle, Washington, with over 500,000 members. The present analyses are part of a larger study based at GH of the p harm a co genetic epidemiology of cardiovascular events [11–13]. This study was approved by the GH Human Subjects Review Committee, and all study participants provided written informed consent.  

# Subjects  

Case subjects were GH members who sustained a first hospitalized non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke during 1995 through 2002. We identified potential cases using computerized GH hospital discharges and confirmed events through medical records review [11]. Myocardial infarction events were confirmed by reviewing symptoms, cardiac enzymes, and electrocardiograph ic findings. Ischemic stroke events were confirmed according to the presence of a rapid-onset neurologic deficit that persisted at least 24 hours or evidence of infarction on brain imaging studies or at surgery. Hemorrhagic strokes were defined according to evidence of blood in the sub ara ch noid space or ventricles or dense in trap are nch y mal blood on brain imaging studies. Control subjects were a random sample of GH members, frequency-matched to the myocardial infarction case group (the largest case group) by decade of age, sex, menopausal status, the presence of treated hypertension, and study year at a ratio of at least 2:1. Cases and controls were eligible only if the medical records indicated that (1) they had not sustained a prior myocardial infarction or stroke, (2)  

they were between the ages of 30 and 79, and (3) they had made at least 4 visits to a GH provider. Individuals identified as case or control subjects who were willing and able to provide a venous blood sample for genotyping were included in the present genetic study. Because of the design of the parent study, subjects included in analyses were hypertensive men, and post menopausal women with and without hypertension.  

# Data collection  

Each subject was assigned a reference date. The reference date for cases was the date of the myocardial infarction or stroke, and for controls was a randomly-selected date during the year for which they were selected as a control. Clinical information was collected using the medical records for the period prior to (but not including) the reference date. Thus, for cases, all clinical information preceded the occurrence of myocardial infarction or stroke. Trained abstract or s recorded information on clinical cardiovascular risk factors including angina, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, blood pressure levels, height, weight, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, and recent laboratory values including total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and serum creatinine. Medical record abstract or s were not blinded to casecontrol status, although they were unaware of the study hypotheses, and data collection was performed using comparable methods for cases and controls.  

# Selection and analysis of haplotypes  

MMP3 and MMP9 were sequenced by the Seattle Program for Genomic Applications using DNA obtained from a panel of 24 Black/African-American and 23 White/EuropeanAmerican individuals, as previously described [12]. Haplotype-tagging sets of singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected to describe genetic variation in Black/ African-American and White/European-American individuals. These variants were then genotyped using the Illumina platform in the GH study population. This high-throughput genotyping platform only detects bi-allelic variants, and the aforementioned MMP3 promoter 5A/6A insertion/deletion was therefore not genotyped. One of the SNPs that was included (MMP3 SNP 12243 [ rs3025058])  is in tight linkage d is equilibrium with this locus  $(\mathrm{r}^{2}=0.99)$  , so that this SNP provided information about the association of the MMP3 promoter insertion/deletion with study outcomes. Phased haplotypes were estimated using the genotype information and PHASE 2.0 software [14]. Haplotypes that had a frequency among controls below  $5\%$   were combined into a “rare haplotypes” category.  

# Statistical analysis  

Characteristics of case and control subjects were compared using  $\chi^{2}$   and t-tests. Logistic regression with robust standard errors was performed to assess the association between MMP3 and MMP9 haplotypes and SNPs with risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke, after adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. For global tests of case-control differences in the distribution of MMP3 and MMP9 haplotypes, we modeled all observed haplotypes as independent indicator variables and tested for overall statistical significance using the Wald test for the set of indicator variables. Ambiguous haplotypes were resolved by probability weighting [15], and the alternate approach of selecting the most probable haplotype was found to produce nearly identical results. For analyses of individual haplotypes and SNPs, we modeled risks according to a log-additive model for trend across 0, 1, and 2 haplotype or allele copies. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) associated with each additional copy were estimated. Further analyses examined the effect of adjusting for established vascular risk factors including hypertension/blood pressure, hyper lipid emi a, diabetes, and smoking. Results were repeated after stratification according to ancestry (selfreported race). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 8.0.  

# RESULTS  

Included were 854 individuals with myocardial infarction, 367 with ischemic stroke, 66 with hemorrhagic stroke, and 2,696 control subjects free of prior myocardial infarction and stroke (Table 1).  

# MMP3 gene  

MMP3 is 13,003 bp in length with 10 exons. Sequencing was performed on  $91.5\%$   of the MMP3 gene (exon 3 was omitted), and 8 of 9 haplotype-tagging SNPs that were identified were successfully genotyped on case and control subjects. Global statistical testing indicated that overall genetic variation in MMP3 was not significantly associated with risk of myocardial infarction or stroke (Table 2). Further analyses identified significant associations between MMP3 haplotype 2 and risk of events. With non-carriers of haplotype 2 as the reference group, the adjusted OR per copy of haplotype 2 was 0.80 (  $95\%$   confidence interval 0.66, 0.98) for myocardial infarction and 1.69 (  $95\%$   confidence interval 1.05, 2.75) for hemorrhagic stroke. As for myocardial infarction, analyses of ischemic stroke suggested decreased risk with MMP3 haplotype 2, but the OR was not significantly different from the null (adjusted  $\mathrm{OR}=0.85$  ,   $95\%$   confidence interval 0.64, 1.12). Results for the combined endpoint of myocardial infarction-plus-ischemic stroke were statistically significant (adjusted   $\mathrm{OR}=0.82$  ,  $95\%$   confidence interval 0.69, 0.97). After additional adjustment for hypertension, systolic blood pressure, hyper lipid emi a, diabetes, and smoking, the observed associations were similar although confidence intervals were wider (adjusted OR   $[95\%$  confidence interval]  $=0.83$   [0.68, 1.02] for myocardial infarction,  $=0.89$   [0.67, 1.18] for ischemic stroke, and  $=1.67$   [1.03, 2.71] for hemorrhagic stroke). Associations between MMP3 haplotype 2 and outcomes persisted when analyses were limited to White/Europeanorigin subjects. Other race/ethnic groups were too small to permit separate analyses. Analyses of individual MMP3 SNPs did not suggest a significant association between polymorphism at any single MMP3 locus and risk of myocardial infarction or stroke.  

# MMP9 gene  

MMP9 is 11,224 bp in length with 13 exons. Sequencing was performed on  $98.4\%$   of the MMP9 gene (portions of exons 11 and 12 were omitted). For MMP9, 6 haplotype-tagging SNPs were identified (3 were non-synonymous) and 4 were successfully genotyped on cases and controls. MMP9 haplotypes and SNPs were not significantly associated with myocardial infarction or stroke (Table 3).  

# DISCUSSION  

We observed that haplotypic variation in MMP3 (strom elys in-1) appears to be associated with vascular risk. Each additional copy of MMP3 haplotype 2 was associated with a statistically significant  $20\%$   lower risk of myocardial infarction when compared with noncarriers of this haplotype. Results for ischemic stroke were similar but did not achieve significance, which may reflect lower statistical power due to the smaller number of strokes as compared with the number of myocardial infarction s. In addition, each additional copy of MMP3 haplotype 2 was significantly associated with a  $70\%$   increase in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. No single SNP unambiguously identified MMP3 haplotype 2, and none of the individual MMP3 SNPs was significantly associated with risk (Table 2). Our results suggest the presence of a MMP3 haplotype association in the absence of an MMP3 SNP association, and also suggest pleotropic effects of MMP3 on cardiac and cerebro vascular endpoints. In contrast to results for MMP3, risk of vascular events was not associated with MMP9 haplotypes or SNPs.  

This study is in agreement with several prior investigations indicating that genetic variation in MMP3 may affect risk of a the roth rom bot ic events. One of the SNPs studied, MMP3 SNP 12243  (rs3025058) , is in tight linkage d is equilibrium   $(\mathbf{r}^{2}=0.99)$   with the well-studied 5A/ 6A insertion/deletion at position -1612 in the MMP3 promoter. MMP3 haplotype 2, which appeared to protect against myocardial infarction (and predispose to hemorrhagic stroke), harbors the C allele in MMP3 SNP 12243, which is a marker for the MMP3 -1612 6A allele. Prior studies have linked the MMP3 promoter 6A allele with lower risk of acute coronary events [5–7] and ischemic stroke [16]. The 6A allele is also associated with reduced  in vitro promoter activity and MMP-3 expression [4,5,17]. These data support the hypothesis that activity of MMP-3, which is present in at hero sclerotic lesions [2], may increase the risk of acute vascular events by mediating inflammation or plaque rupture [2,3,18]. We also identified an association between MMP3 haplotype 2 and increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Matrix-degrading enzyme activity may play a role in the etiology of brain hemorrhage by disrupting the blood-brain barrier or favoring the development of aneurysms, consistent with studies that have altered MMPs and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) in animal models [19,20]. Prior epidemiological studies of MMP3 and other MMP genes in relation to risk of hemorrhagic stroke [21,22] and intra cranial aneurysm [23] have been null, but data in this area are incomplete and prior studies have been limited to single SNPs. Our finding that the same MMP3 haplotype appeared to protect against thrombotic events (ie, myocardial infarction) and promote bleeding events (ie, hemorrhagic stroke) may also be explained by cleavage of coagulation and fi bri no ly tic proteins (plasminogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, fibrinogen) by MMP-3 [24–27].  

Our study did not show any significant association between genetic variation in MMP9 and vascular risk. One of the variants studied, MMP9 SNP 7556, is in tight linkage   $(\mathbf{r}^{2}=0.99)$  with a previously-identified variant in the gene promoter region (MMP9 C-1562T) that has been reported to predict MMP expression and vascular disease [28].  

Exclusion of nonfatal cases is a limitation of this study. Because relatively few individuals were of non-White ethnicity, our ability to draw conclusions about groups with other ancestral backgrounds is limited. In addition, our findings will require replication in future studies.  

In summary, this study identified a haplotype in MMP3 that predicted decreased risk of myocardial infarction and increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. A notable finding was the demonstration of a haplotype effect of MMP3 on vascular risk that is not likely to be fully explained by MMP3 -1612 5A/6A or any other previously-identfied risk alleles [5–7,16]. Thus, the use of haplotype-tagging SNP sets in this study to describe genetic variation in MMP3 appeared to be important. This finding further supports prior evidence that genetic variation in MMP3 may contribute to risk of vascular disease.
